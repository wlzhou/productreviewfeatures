review/text: The tension rod was purchased to hold a shower curtain for a small shower. Although quite attractive, the rubber on the ends was not strong enough to hold a shower curtain. It didn't specify as to what kind of a tension rod it was. I will hopefully use it for a regular curtain.

review/text: This album title often surfaces in conversations about music, and some who don't listen to a lot of jazz are likely to hear unreserved superlatives when it is described. If those people go out and buy this, they're not likely to be over impressed on one listen. These are not easy sounds to listen to, much less enjoy, if your tastes have been bred on a diet of Kenny G or Michael Brecker.But give it a chance. This CD isn't just a recording of a man playing saxophone in front of a small combo; this is a jazz giant reaching an epiphany in his effort to express through music the raw essence of his love for God.I don't pretend to know a lot about the technical aspects of Coltrane's gift for playing the saxophone, but that's unnecessary to enjoy this. This is human expression in its purest, most unaffected form. Sit back in a comfortable chair and let this wash over you a few times. Listen to it, not as background music, but as if someone were speaking intimately to you on an important subject.I'm certain that some may still not be able to bridge the aural gap between radio-friendly pabulum and this undistilled product, but I'm equally certain that others will prize this recording as the jazz jewel in their CD collection.

review/text: Asimov's classic series has a quaint, nave simplicity about it that never fails to entrance this reader. For all its episodic construction (unavoidable, considering the unparalleled scope) and its rather flat, exclusively male characters, the Foundation Trilogy takes readers back to a time when America was making the world safe for democracy, personal freedoms were a given, and science seemed to be the salvation of a fallible humanity.The first volume, Foundation, sets up the whole idea of the Seldon Plan, a mathematically based view of sociopolitical forces that enables one brilliant scientist to mold a new galactic empire from a foundation of one hundred thousand scientists and their families. After the introduction, whose final paragraphs subtly lay out the whole structure without our knowing it, we get to see the Plan in action as the Foundation faces a series of political and military crises. Because the scientist/hero is long dead before the second chapter, the heroes are the political and economic, rather than scientific, leaders who must resist the temptation to take direct military action, and instead allow events to proceed until Seldon's Plan points out the answer. The magic of this book is the exquisite means the Foundation uses to defeat its enemies without resorting to force, and the convincing arguments Asimov uses to make these solutions seem inevitable. As such, each chapter is like a sociopolitical puzzle that challenges the reader to find the move that will defuse each situation, and taken together these stories comprise a virtual primer in diplomacy.Countless millions of fans have enjoyed Asimov's Foundation Trilogy, consisting of Foundation, Foundation and Empire, and Second Foundation. Other Foundation novels, written by the master in his later years, lack the simple charm that makes these earlier works so popular. They were tacked on solely because the power of those first three created a demand that Asimov felt obligated to try to fill, but they have an entirely different feel, and don't possess that single-minded surety of artistic vision that marked the original series.This book is about political maneuvering, not action, so it may not be a favorite of action/adventure fans, although the next book in the series, Foundation and Empire, is a little more dynamic, and reading the complete Trilogy is a must, since the first two volumes don't so much end as just leave off. Still, the vast historical vision begun in this book is so sweeping, it should not be missed by any fans of speculative fiction.

review/text: I went into "Tess of the D'urbervilles" with full knowledge of the harsh fate waiting for Tess, but that knowledge still could not prepare me for how harrowing and painful that journey was for her, and the reader. The character of Tess is so moral, innocent, kind, and unselfish against the society that is anything but, that Hardy's message of fate and social hypocrisy reveals itself full force in the novel. Tess has a love for life and an optimism that takes the harshest and cruelest society to beat down, and that is heartbreaking to behold.I thought this was going to be a stuffy English novel, despite the fact I quite enjoy (most) Victorian novels I read. However, I discovered that Hardy's prose flows well and is even beautifully poetic. Some of the best lines come from Tess's mouth, showing that she is not only morally upright, but also smart and incredibly perceptive.Hardy has a great way with words; romantic scenes are intensely passionate, emotional letters drip with feeling, and narrations delve into the feelings and thoughts of the characters so that the reader can understand, pity, empathize and sympathize with them. Most surprising perhaps is Hardy's understanding of the female mind; I think he has developed Tess into a believable and realistic heroine, and he has many interesting things to say about the differences of the genders, especially during that time period."Tess of the D'urbervilles" is a gorgeous yet heart-breaking novel. Not only does it entertain with its poetic prose and social themes, the novel also opens one's mind to the hypocrisy of the times; hypocrisies that even now may still appear in the thoughts and actions of people in this "modern" society.

review/text: This is one of Lewis's most famous and oft-quoted works, and for good reason. It is an honest and intelligent - not to mention brilliantly written - examination of the many facets of the Christian faith and human nature: the existence of and belief in God, the Trinity, faith, love, pride, morality etc. Although written during World War Two, the subjects explored still resonate powerfully with contemporary concerns.I found the opening chapters particularly helpful in presenting a well-argued case for the rational foundations of Christianity, or at least belief in the existence of God. It offers a challenge to Christians to question the intellectual grounds for their faith, and the reassurance that sufficient answers can be found. Non-Christians looking to investigate the rational basis of Christianity, or of religion in general, will also find this an accessible and thought-provoking read.The book is also an ideal place to start for anyone thinking to dip into the non-fiction works of C. S. Lewis. No book in my opinion gives the reader a better first taste of the prolific author's delicious prose, keen intellect and razor-sharp wit.I cannot recommend this book more. For the Christian, for the non-Christian, and for the fan of `good books': this is a must-read!

review/text: While I loved both movies, Jean de Florette and the sequel Manon of the Spring, I would rate the first of the pair to to have an edge over the second. They are both masterfully done, and you really can't watch just one of them, as they are an inseparable pair, the first movie forming the background for the second, and the second providing the resolution for the first. Without giving up too much of the story, these movies tell a story of greed, "accidental" murder, and resolution with the likes of Greek tragedy--critically and tenderly revealing the mysterious nature of the human heart. Two of the best set of movies ever in my lifetime. My only criticism of the 2nd movie is the weak portrayal of the young woman, which came down to either poor direction or perhaps a poor casting decision. Overall, this flaw can be overlooked, as these two movies will stand as classics for many years to come.

review/text: Released in 2006 on Virgin/EMI, this package is by far the best available collection of hits, singles, and favorites from synth pop trio Heaven 17. Pretty much unknown in America, Heaven 17 scored a number of hit singles and smash albums in the early to mid 1980s in the U.K. and much of Europe. In America, they are best known for their lone Hot 100 charting single "Let Me Go", which climbed to #74 in 1983 and still finds a place on a number of 80's compilations today. In the U.K., they are best known for the #2 1983 smash "Temptation", which is their biggest single there.The CD clocks in at 76 minutes, making almost full use of the 80 minutes CD capacity by including 19 digitally remastered tracks, covering the band's successful, and not so successful, output from 1981 to 1988 on Virgin. The DVD features, as far as I know, all 13 of the band's promo music videos in addition to a few extras.The highlight is the CD audio remastering by Donal Whelan at Hafod Mastering, finally bringing a previously unheard clarity, dimension, and punch to these recordings. These tracks sound wonderful, and the audio upgrade alone is enough to add this collection to your cart! Even the liner notes make a reference to the band thinking that this is how these tracks were meant to be heard, only that technology was limited at the time. "It sounds tremendous, by the way. It brought a tear to my eye, for real", stated Heaven 17 member Martyn Ware.All tracks are the original album versions, except for 7" edits of "Temptation", "And That's No Lie", and "Contenders" in addition to 7" versions of "The Ballad Of Go Go Brown" and "Train Of Love In Motion". Considering official 7" edits exist for a number of other singles presented here -- including "Come Live With Me", "Crushed By The Wheels Of Industry" and "Penthouse And Pavement" -- the tracklisting isn't really consistent, as if the label had randomly picked edits over album versions. I think all 7" edits/versions should have been presented here, with the original album versions available on the 2006 remastered albums.Now on to the DVD -- Region Free and PAL format. The tracklisting: 1 Penthouse And Pavement, 2 Let Me Go, 3 Temptation, 4 We Live So Fast, 5 Come Live With Me, 6 Crushed By The Wheels Of Industry, 7 Sunset Now, 8 This Is Mine, 9 And That's No Lie, 10 Contenders, 11 The Foolish Thing To Do, 12 Trouble, 13 Train Of Love In Motion. Extras -- 1 Temptation '92, 2 Penthouse And Pavement '93. The extras are simply early 90's remixes of the original tracks using both original video footage and some random promo video footage from over the years.The DVD was produced by Abbey Road Interactive, a studio that is usually known for doing good to stunning work for the EMI label -- excellent audio/visual DVD hits packages for The Human League and John Lennon come to mind. I was let down with their work on the DVD here, which may just stem from the budget given to the studio from EMI.Abbey Road is known to reissue their promo videos with a remastered soundtrack. Unfortunately, this release is missing a remastered soundtrack on a number of videos, yet the sound on a number of other videos is in fact remastered! It's almost as if Abbey Road randomly chose videos for which to include the remastered sound. Some videos feature the audio as brilliantly remastered as the sound on the CD, yet other videos feature a mediocre mastering. Even a few videos suffer from a horrible mastering, if I can even call it that, since it's probably just the original audio that accompanied the original video source. It's almost like Virgin/Abbey Road put out a half finished product. What a shame!"Penthouse And Pavement", which is the first track on the DVD, uses the original poor quality soundtrack. Suddenly, the sound improves greatly when we get to the second track, "Let Me Go", which is not quite as sharp as the CD version. "Temptation", on the other hand, sounds like it was lifted directly from the remastered CD. Then we come to "We Live So Fast", which is rather poor, but "Come Live With Me" in it's edited 7" version sounds as crisp as the original version on the CD. "Crushed By The Wheels Of Industry" follows and sounds as poor and distorted as "Penthouse And Pavement"!That's not to say that these videos aren't worth watching. Actually, the picture quality isn't that bad. If I had to guess, these videos more than likely were pulled from their original source masters. Considering the age of these releases I can't really expect better quality than what is presented here, since some of these promos were naturally grainy with mediocre lighting and spotty darkness, such as 1981's "Penthouse And Pavement" and 1983's "Temptation". Other videos look pretty good for their age, including 1982's "Let Me Go" (maybe because it's in black and white?) and 1983's "Crushed By The Wheels Of Industry".In any case, this CD/DVD package is a very enjoyable release with the excellent CD sonic upgrade and generous 19 tracks. (And yes, that "Temptation [Original '81 Demo] is worth checking out!) The DVD, despite it's faults, is still a nice addition to the package, even if a number of the videos are very cheesy! All in all, 4 stars for a package that could have benefited from a remastered video soundtrack on ALL promos and for the random use of edits on the CD. Nonetheless, I highly recommend this compilation.

review/text: The Witch of Blackbird Pond is one of my three all-time favorite books. I reread it every few years and each time, I learn somthing new about the characters. Kit Tyler is a wonderful heroine, and her struggle to adjust to life in America is a wonderful metaphor that most children (and even adults) can relate to, whether it's moving to a new school, job, or community. Plus, the historical aspect separates this wonderful novel from the rest of the pack. You'll learn something while being entertained- what more can you ask for?!

review/text: I have a theory about upward mobility as it exists in a corporate workplace (actually, I've been relaying this theory for so long that I no longer remember if it is my own, or if I've stolen it from someone smarter than I; If it's the latter, I apologize for my thievery). If one is ambitious enough, and good enough at their job, they will get promoted. If they are still ambitious, and good enough at this new job, they will get promoted again. This process continues until said person reaches the limits of their abilities. Then they are promoted one last time, into a job that they can't possibly handle. This is where they stay for the rest of their working lives. I've seen it happen time and time again at my place of work, and it's this kind of sophistic reasoning that gets spoofed so mercilessly -- and so perfectly -- in &quot;Office Space&quot;.Writer/Director Mike Judge has crafted a spot on depiction of office life in the latter part of the twentieth century. Technology has advanced to such a degree that those who fail to understand it are either relegated to being its slaves (a running joke here has a nefarious fax machine tormenting two programmers) or promoted to management. Those in the latter category, made obsolete by technological advancements and having no real duties themselves, are relegated to becoming bothersome micromanagers, in the hopes that their stock rises a quarter of a point. Everyone is worried about job security, and rightly so, for the average worker is about as interchangeable as the coffee machine, and respected less. And anyone with any semblance of a soul is constantly involved in bemoaning the wastefulness of their lives.Peter Gibbons (Ron Livingstone) is one such troubled soul. He's involved in his company's Y2K readiness project (with the benefit of hindsight, the pointlessness of this task is made even more pointed). But he despises his job. Tormented by ennui but hampered by lethargy, he sees no way out. A fateful visit to a career-counseling hypnotist frees him from his shackles, by allowing him to relax into his job. His newfound candidness is, of course, rewarded with a promotion. Livingstone imbues Peter with a bland everymaness that is at once appealing and relatable. He is surrounded by a madcap menagerie of accurately depicted office drones.David Herman (as the unfortunately named Michael Bolton) and Ajay Naidu play Peter's clueless programmer buddies, rebellious enough to constantly plot against the company, but too scared to do anything about it. The three of them share my favourite scene in the movie, when the aforementioned fax machine is smuggled out of the office, and beaten mercilessly with a baseball bat. Judge handles the scene like a hit in a mob movie, or a drive-by shooting, adding aggressive hip-hop music to the soundtrack, to play up the ridiculousness of the situation. The scene is played as horrific, but turns out truly hilarious. Other office citizens include John C. McGinley and Paul Willson, who play gleefully insipid consultants, brought in to give the company an excuse to downsize, and Richard Riehle as a paranoid lifer, whose job may or may not be redundant.The biggest cheers in the cast go to Gary Cole and Stephen Root. The former plays VP Bill Lumbergh. He's every employee's worst nightmare: a lifeless, endlessly droning, boring, malicious, and unimaginative manager. Brought to life through a costume that includes unfashionable glasses, shirts that match collar to cuffs, and an ever-present coffee mug, Lumbergh subtly terrorizes all who serve him with salutations that make him appear interested, but in fact amplifies the apathy he has for his employees. Cole nails Lumbergh perfectly, allowing the man's slime to ooze from every pore. Stephen Root, in the film's showiest role, plays Milton, a milquetoast, asocial, &quot;squirrelly looking guy&quot;. Saddled with coke bottle thick glasses and an inflamed complexion, Milton is the ultimate social outcast. Root gives Milton an under-his-breath lispy voice, easy to overlook. So much so that his repeated threats to &quot;burn the building down&quot; if not granted any respect go unnoticed. The passive aggressive cat and mouse game fought between Lumbergh and Milton over a stapler (!) provide for some of the film's best and most telling moments.Jennifer Aniston, who plays Livingstone's love interest, does fine work with an underwritten role. She brings a kind of quirky restlessness to Joanna the waitress (tormented by a witless boss of her own, played by Mike Judge himself), although her desperation shines through as well (otherwise, why would she torture herself working at a classless establishment as &quot;Chotchkie's&quot;?).&quot;Office Space&quot; will touch a nerve with anyone whose ever worked in a large office. In fact, if you've ever encountered schizophrenic traffic (the film's opening scene follows Peter on his morning commute; he's caught in a hilarious catch-22, as any lane he changes to slows to a stop, just as the lane he's just come from starts to move), been bothered by door-to-door magazine salesmen, gotten zinged by static electricity, or been maligned by any of a dozen other inconveniences of modern urban life, you'll find something here to relate to. And, ultimately, laugh at.

review/text: I am not a Catholic but enjoyed this book very much when I first read it sometime ago. Dr. Schreck has written a book that goes beyond the usual Catholic apologist rhetoric and simply explains his position without resulting to silly arguments and questenable tactics.His writing style is easy and likeable. He is not so bent on trying to prove, in my opinion, as much as he is trying to share the essence of Catholic beliefs to outsiders. The book is probably, though not necessarily, directed to protestants. I say this because he addresses many protetsant objections to Catholism, without seeking to enrage those on the other side. It is a sharpe way of presenting one's faith, without causing more flame to the fire.The book is not the most detialed or academic of its kind, but this again is a strength. The layperson, who most needs to read and better understand the Catholic faith and practice, will find this book most appealling (at least I hope so). I think this was the author's intent. A great little book.

review/text: If you are interested in a truly great movie, representative of a historical period of time, early 1900s in China --- this is it!!! The sets, costumes and plot make this a MUST and HAVE TO purchase DVD for anyone who is interested in Chinese culture. Fascinating!!!! Don't be bothered that there are subtitles, they are written well. However, the acting is superb and communicates beyond the Mandarin. This surpasses Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon ten fold for anyone who is interested in a Chinese-made movie that is not merely martial arts. One of the best movies that I have ever seen, equivalent to The Last Emperor. For all ages!!!For technophiles like myself, this is fascinating to watch --- the introduction of photography and moving pictures in China.

review/text: Daughters of Darkness is the second book in the Night World series and centres around three groups of people - Mark and Mary Lynette Carter, two siblings who are wannabe astronomers, Rowan, Kestral and Jade Redfern, three vampire sisters escaping the confining life their previous home the vampire conclave, and Ash Redfern, their elder brother who's come to drag them home and successfully has L.J. Smith fans swooning in the aisles.It is an interesting premise, and things start to heat up when the girls arrive at their great-aunt Opal Burdock's house in Briar Creek only to find her staked through the heart. Panicking, they bury the body in the garden outside, but are witnessed by Mary-Lynette who's watching the stars on the hill overlooking the house. Doubtful that Mrs Burdock is really dead, Mary-Lynette and her brother nevertheless investigate, and come across the vampire sisters hunting in the wood...However, because Mark and Jade fall pretty fast for each other a truce is made and the sisters share their fears with the two siblings - something is out there, something that's killing things, and all of them work their dectective skills to figure out who it is ... Ash? Bunny Marten, the shop attendant with the lamia name? Jeremy, the garage worker with a deep, dark secret? A vampire hunter?And then Ash turns up, and to his and Mary-Lynette's horror, they find they are soulmates, destined to be together even though Ash is not a very nice guy.The story is pretty interesting, and it's fun to guess whodunnit, though I admit I was a *little* disappointed as to the murderer's motives. L.J. Smith obviously had fun designing the three sisters, all with different personalities and features. For once there wasn't a contrived happy ending that is so popular in L.J. Smith's books, and the atmosphere of the book was very well done too - the desert-like Briar Creek gave a sense of being trapped in the middle of nowhere with a wild beast on the loose, and chemistry between all the characters was realistic, poignent, and sometimes funny. (Watch out for Ash giving Jeremy a hard time).All in all, this was a much better book than the first 'Secret Vampire', which extented the Night World a bit, and mingled together characters that have been in previous books (Ash) and characters who'll appear in future ones (Quinn).

review/text: Having read Feehan's &quot;Dark&quot; series, I have to say that I think this is her best book ever. THE SCARLETTI CURSE is a true gothic romance, and people who love gothics--like me--will definitely want to read it.The book has elements that were in Feehan's vampire novels and which will be familiar to that audience: telepathy; a dictatorial hero (the curse of the Scarlettis is that they're supposedly destined to kill the women they love in jealous rages); the heroine with REALLY long hair; destiny. There's also the quintessential gothic palace--poetically called the &quot;Palace della Morte&quot; by the local villagers--with hideous artwork, secret passageways, etc., etc., whose inhabitants all seem to be up to something nefarious.I quickly became completely engrossed in the story. No, it's not terribly original, but I loved every turn in the plot, anyway. The story is told very much from the heroine's point of view, which is appropriate, and all the other characters were well filled-out and suited for their purpose in the book. The reason I'm giving THE SCARLETTI CURSE four stars instead of five, however, is that the book, while enjoyable, did have some problems. For example, the love scenes seemed emotionless and out of place in the novel, which was odd because Feehan usually excells at love scenes. I also thought the explanation for everything happening at the &quot;Palace della Morte&quot; didn't quite make sense.Despite these two things, however, I thoroughly enjoyed THE SCARLETTI CURSE, and I think Christine Feehan has found her niche! I would recommend this book to anyone who enjoys the work of Ann Radcliffe, Mary Stewart, the Brontes, or even Lisa Jane Smith. Definitely, a good read.

review/text: Tamara Dobson was fabulously stylish, sexy, and intelligent in her role as Cleopatra Jones, the Karate/Kung Fu kicking United States Special Government Agent ("jurisdiction from Turkey to Watts Tower baby") who battles Drug Lord Mommy (Shelly Winters). Cleo ruffles Mommy's feathers by burning her Turkish poppy field that has a street value of $30 million. Mommy retaliates by getting her bad cop friends to bust the B&S; House which is run by Cleo's boyfriend Rueben (Bernie Casey). The B&S; House helps local drug addicts kick the habit. The B&S; House staff have a Black Panther Party mentality.To add action and humor to the movie is Mommy's odd crew of gay beauties that cater to her every whim; clutsy henchmen; Pusher Doodlebug (Antonio Fargas, best known from "Starsky & Hutch"). Doodlebug has his own odd crew that includes his high maintenance girlfriend Tiffany (Brenda Sykes, also played in "Black Gunn"), Pickle (Teddy Wilson who went on to star on tv shows like "Good Times", "That's My Mama", and "Sanford & Son"), white chauffer/butler Mattingly (real surname). Don Corneilus (Soul Train) has a cameo as himself. Ester Rolle ("Good Times") has a cameo as the mother of Cleo's two Karate kicking friends, The Johnson Brothers. This movie has a plethora of actors, both black and white, who went on to have extensive acting careers.The well written story and screenplay is by Max Julien, who is best known for his role as "The Mack" and "Thomasine & Bushrod". The soundtrack yielded two hits, one by Joe Simon and the other by Millie Jackson.Dobson portrayed a strong black woman with a positive character. Outside of driving the James Bond type Corvette complete with phone, personalized plates, government issued weapons concealed in the door and a top that automatically raised (awesome in 1973) to accomodate Dobson's 6 foot, 2 inch height... she displayed motor bike riding skills and a little bi-lingual capabilities that must have been needed for her traveling abroad.The ending scene, the Bon Voyage party for Cleo ends with her white friend Police Captain Lou Crawford (Dan Frazer who has a very extensive acting portfolio with the likes of "Kojak", "Law & Order", and "As The World Turns") saying "Right On" while holding up a clinched fist (black power sign) as Cleo drives off into the sunset for her next big assignment. His actions amaze the other party people and is a priceless ending that should leave a smile on your face to go with this happy ending.The disconsolate news of Tamara Dobson's death in October 2006 smothered the flames of my nostalgic dreams of her reprising the Cleo role for a third time (second time circa 1975, "Cleopatra Jones and the Casino of Gold"). All biographical accounts document Tamara Dobson as having studied fashion at the Maryland Institute College of Arts before her professional modeling career. Her acting career included film appearances in "Norman... Is That You?", "Chained Heat", "Come Back, Charleston Blue", "Murder at the World Series", "Jason of Star Command", and "Buck Rogers in the 25th Century". Beyonce appears to have paid homage to "Cleopatra Jones" when she played Foxxy Cleopatra in the Austin Powers movie.Tamara Dobson's role as Cleo was a hit and this movie is a classic that would add value to any so-called blaxploitation (Soul Cinema) era movie collection.by:Pamela Jarmon

review/text: Ghostface just doesn't make bad albums, you should know that by now. If you like Ghostface's style of rap (mile-a-minuet jargon or intricately detailed story telling) then you're be ready for another great installment to his career. If you don't like his style, which is not for everyone, that's fine: The Pretty Toney Album is probably not for you.The thing that takes this album to the next level is the sampling style and production. The majority of the songs are heavy in soul samples, straddling the line between creativity and blatant jacking. Somehow, to Ghost's credit it just works. Although Ghost uses a host of producers, it flows really well together and the styles don't seem that different from each other.The intro sets the stage for Pretty Toney, Ghost makes this music for the art and himself... not to please everyone. So either get behind him or step back. "Biscuits" sets things off nicely with True Master production using an uncredited sample. [...] is a quick typical dark RZA track."Beat The Clock" is the first incredible track. Minnesota provides the fast paced beat, which sends Ghost literally racing. "Metal Lungies" is another outstanding track, which uses some nice deep horns over a dark beat provided by No I.D. Sheek & Styles only add to this track, which has a Wu-Tang feel to it. "It's Over" uses an almost identical piano loop from Biggie's "Who Shot Ya?", although it's not noticeable at all, since the track takes a completely different direction. Ghost goes into his story-telling mode on this one, he's been one of the most consistent at doing this for the past decade."Holla" & "Save Me Dear" do something I'm not sure I've heard before. They both have Ghost rapping not just over soul samples, but the entire original song. I'll admit it was a weird experience hearing The Delfonics "La-La (Means I Love You)" in entirety easily recognizable in the background of "Holla". After I got over the initial shock, I realized the way Ghost's lyrics match up with the original song make this truly exceptional. "Be This Way" is also heavy with this soul sample of Billy Stewart, ghost flips it into a dark depressing track. This is one of my favorite tracks on the album; Nottz's production is just incredible."Run" could be in the running for Ghost's best track ever. RZA just brings a sick beat, that's got that ominous Wu-Tang song yet creates a sense of urgency. Police and sirens in the background only help out. The whole song really pulls together on the concept of being on the run from the police, plus Jadakiss and Ghostface rhymes are both clever and well paced. Defiantly the best track on the album."Tush" has some great production and is sure to have some people loving the track. As many that like it will hate it because of Missy's spot or the "single" quality of it. I can see people's opinion either way, but it doesn't cause a problem on this album even if you want to skip it. "Love" is a pretty solid introspective song, yet it lacks the production and emotion that Ghost's previous tracks like this have had (see "All That I Got Is You").Two skits are actually short songs, rapped like short stories: "Keisha's House" & "Last Night." The latter especially will have you questioning why it was cut so short. The other skits don't take away from the album and are typical Ghostface skits (lots of yelling, mostly incoherent dialogue. Ghost fans should be used to this.)There are some missteps on this album. "Ghostface" has a really weak beat, wack chorus, and has nothing to bring to the table. "Tooken Back" is just really silly and Jackie-O simply is not welcome.As a quick note, it's worth mentioning that Def Jam should have paid up for the samples and allowed Ghost to release the album as it was originally presented, it is a classic. The tracks left off would seriously take this album to untouchable status.At the end of the album, the big thing that makes you look past the missteps is the fact that you can listen to the other tracks over and over again. I've had this album since it came out and I can honestly say, while it's not the best I've bought this past year, it's easily one that I listen to the most. There's just something about it that makes multiple listens not just easy, but something that you want. You know an album is really good when you just keep finding it going back into your system after a long period of time. It might not be the best album of the year, and it might not even be the best of Ghostface Killah's catalogue, but The Pretty Toney Album is certainly going to have you listening to it as if it was.

review/text: Prison break films are a staple of Hollywood and even TV nowadays. They go back to the earliest years of the talkie period. "The Big House" (1930) was the first film to gain wide critical and popular acclaim. Films like Hell's House" (1932), Hell's Highway" (1932), "20,000 Years in Sing Sing" (1932) and "The Mayor from Hell" (1933) followed, as well as the chain gang films, the most famous of which was "I am a Fugitive from a Chain Gang" (1932) and later "Cool Hand Luke" (1967).In addition to the standard prison film and chain gang films, there are a number of other sub genres like "women in prison films" - "Caged" (1950), "Women in Cages" (1973) - and "escape from POW camps" - "The Great Escape" (1963), "The Colditz Story" (1955) - films.Here in 1947 we have a run of the mill escape from prison story, notable only for the quality of the cast that includes Burt Lancaster, Charles Bickford, Sam Levene, Jeff Corey and Howard Duff among the prisoners and Hume Cronyn and Jay C Flippen among the guards. The film was said to be inspired by a 1946 attempted escape from Alcatraz, but in fact the plot points are so ordinary that no explanatory is necessary.Burt Lancaster (1913-94) plays the tough guy and the ring leader of the escape. Lancaster was noted for his athleticism ("Flame and the Arrow", "Jim Thorpe", "Crimson Pirate", "Trapeze" ), his intensity ("Come Back Little Sheba", "From Here to Eternity", "The Rose Tattoo", "Elmer Gantry"), and his marvelous westerns ("Gunfight at OK Corral", "Vera Cruz", "The Professionals" , "Valdez is Coming"), but it's his character studies in this film, "Birdman of Alcatraz" (1962), and "Atlantic City" (1980) where we really see his true power as an actor. This was his second film, coming off a tremendous debut in "The Killers" (1946) at the age of 32.Lancaster was nominated for an Oscar in 1953 for "From Here to Eternity" (1953) and would be nominated 3 more times and win for "Elmer Gantry" (1960). He was nominated for a Golden Globe 5 times, starting in 1956 ("The Rainmaker") and including "Birdman of Alcatraz" (1962) and "Atlantic City" (1980). He appears as #19 on the AFI list of Top 50 Screen Legends.Hume Cronyn (1911-2003) plays a power hungry Captain. He had 7 Emmy nominations and 3 wins ("To Dance with the White Dog", "Broadway Bound", "Age Old Friends") but it probably best known for "Cocoon" (1985). Most of his roles were as "good guys" so it's interesting to see him play the bad guy. Unfortunately he is not all that convincing.Crusty Charles Bickford plays the con in charge. Bickford appeared in nearly 100 films. He was nominated for an Oscar three times ("Song of Bernadette" in 1943, "The Farmer's Daughter" in 1947, and "Johnny Belinda" in 1949), and each time, the actress who played opposite him won the Oscar for Best Actress - Jennifer Jones, Loretta Young, and Jane Wyman.Fellow inmates Sam Levene and Jeff Corey appeared in "The Killers" with Lancaster. Both men were a staple in film noir and gangster films. Levene appeared in "Crossfire", several "Thin Man" films, and "Slaughter on 10th Avenue". Jeff Corey appeared in more than 100 films ("Butch Cassidy", "In Cold Blood") and best remembered for his role as Wild Bill Hickock in "Little Big Man" He was blacklisted in the 50s and became an acting coach to such notables as James Dean, Robert Blake, Leonard Nimoy, and Jack Nicholson.Jay C Flippen (1899-1971) plays a guard. He appeared in more than 50 films between 1929 and 1971. He was often paired with Jimmy Stewart ("Winchester 73", "The Far Country", "Strategic Command", "Firecreek") and .John Wayne ("Jet Pilot", "Flying Leathernecks", "Hellfighters"). In the 50s he transitioned to TV where he was a regular on series like "Ensign O'Toole" (1962-3) and "The Virginian" (1966-9).This was the film debut of Howard Duff (1913-90) who is probably most famous for his TV series with wife Ida Lupino, "Mr. Adams and Eve" (1957-8). In the film credits he is identified as the "Voice of Sam Spade" which he was at the time for NBC Radio.Jules Dassin (1911-2008) directs. Dassin did a number of film noir movies ("The Naked City", "Thieves Highway", "Night and the City") before getting in trouble during the HUAC witchhunt and left for Europe where he made "Rififi" (1955), one of the earliest heist movies. In 1961 he was nominated for an Oscar as director and writer for "Never on Sunday".FWIW - Jules Dassin, Hume Cronyn, Jeff Corey, Roman Bohnen (played the warden), and Art Smith (played Dr. Walters) all were blacklisted.William Daniels (1901-70) is the cinematographer. Garbo insisted he shoot all her films, which he did, except for 2 ("Conquest", "Two-faced Woman") which turned out to be flops at the box office. When not working with Garbo, Daniels was a favorite of Erich von Stroheim, who was Garbo's favorite director (even though she made 6 films with Clarence Brown). Daniels lensed more than 150 films. He was nominated 3 times ("Anna Christie", "Cat on a Hot Tin Roof", "How the West was Won") and won once ("Naked City" in 1948). Unfortunately this is one of his poorest efforts.Miklos Rozsa (1907-95) scored more than 100 films and earned 16 Oscar nominations and 3 wins ("A Double Life", "Spellbound", "Ben Hur"). A talented composer, his work in this film is so melodramatic it borders on the comical.1947 wasn't the best year for films. The Oscar winners were "Miracle on 34th Street" and "Gentlemen's Agreement" and the box office leaders included "Unconquered", "The Bachelor and the Bobby Soxer", "Mother Wore Tights" and "Life with Father." Other notable films that year were "Dark Passage" (Bogart), "The Lady From Shanghai" (Orson Welles), and "Possessed" (Joan Crawford).The NY Times' Bosley Crowther criticized the characterizations, saying "the foremost prisoners in this latest Mark Hellinger film seem to be rather all-around good fellows who deserve our most generous regard" and "On the other hand, the warden of the prison is an obvious ineffectual, the doctor is a philosophical drunkard and the captain of the guards is a rogue."There are lots of problems with this film, apart from the poor production values.It's called "Brute Force" but there is really very little force, much less brute force. True, one inmate is forced to stumble into a stamping machine and another is tied to a chain and beaten with a rubber hose. But that's it folks! And there is almost no internal violence, nor any sense that this isn't a safe place to be, apart from the Captain and his one violent aide.Moreover, the idea of showing back stories is intrusive helping to slow down the pace of the film, which isn't all that great in the first place.This film is a big disappointment, considering how talented the actors are and considering that this was 1947. If you're looking for good prison escape films, here are my favorites - "I am a Fugitive from a Chain Gang" (1932), "Each Dawn I Die" (1939), "Cool Hand Luke" (1967), "Papillion" (1973), "Midnight Express" (1978), "Escape from New York" (1981), "The Shawshank Redemption" (1994), and "The Escapist" (2008)

review/text: In "Murder By Injection: The Story of the Medical Conspiracy Against America", Eustace Mullins continues what he started in "Secrets of the Federal Reserve," this time focused on the American Medical Establishment - or rather, the Western Medical Establishment, as the controllers of this system exist in the US and across the pond in England and parts of Western Europe.If you've traveled abroad, especially into Asia, you no doubt know that our system of medical treatment differs substantially. This is because in Asia the culture endorses a homeopathic system, or a reliance on natural remedies that seek to build the body's immune system to fight disease. Here in the West, we have an allopathic system. Although it wasn't always so - and indeed there remain pockets of homeopathic practitioners - modern society's medicine is heavily based on allopathy, in which the focus is on attacking disease at the cell level. An unfortunate byproduct of that aim is that the cell and the immune system itself are harmed during treatment. While a person might recover during their course of allopathic treatment, their natural defenses may have been weakened during the fight, leaving them susceptible to additional disease and viruses.Here, Mullins deftly connects those same Federal Reserve interests to the modern Medical Establishment. On many and varied fronts, Mullins describes how these monopolists seized control American medical care, making it into a multi-billion (and probably trillion) dollar enterprise. Along the way, these manipulators have used expert public relations and advertising to sufficiently convince most everyone that deviating from their allopathic recommendations will result in certain disaster for the individual and society. The author begins with the origins of the monopoly, and then moves into the tale of how Quacks set up their control mechanism; a tale of bribery, graft, hucksterism and murder.I greatly enjoyed the chapters on vaccines, cancer, Aids and fluoridation. Essentially, when there are excess byproducts from these monopolists' latest scheme, such as a World War, they'll find a way to sell it to the public by hook or crook. Such is the case with fluoride, a byproduct of aluminum production and a main ingredient in rat poison, which almost everyone consumes in high quantities via their town or city's water supply.If you've recently stayed at a hospital whether due to an ailment or emergency and then marveled at just how high your bill is, then you'll be interested in Mullins' chapter on The Drug Trust. Needless to say, that little pill that cost you over $20 can be bought retail for pennies. "Administrative Costs" are the reason given by the establishment for the high price, but most likely it's due to creative accounting. This ridiculous system thrives because its overlords are connected to Rockefeller/Rothschild interests. Mullins shows the reader how the medical establishment is interconnected to defense contractors, food production conglomerates, and banking interests; which of course have no interest in actually healing the sick."Murder by Injection" will undoubtedly affect the reader, and should be given wide audience. All of us know someone that has suffered from or is currently battling a debilitating disease, whether cancer or one of the myriad of neurological disorders - perhaps it is the reader themselves. Armed with the information in this book, we can move forward, not being held hostage by a lab coat wearing high priest or the puppet master that moves his hand - and just maybe save our lives.Five stars - heavily and heartily recommended!

review/text: I am very shocked to see so many reviews with five stars for this novel.It was bad, I mean real bad.Some one gave this to me several years ago, and I tried to read it then but it seemed so silly. I picked it up again thinking maybe I would change my mind (I have done that before). It was just as silly as the first time but I bore with it for the most part though I will admit I did some scanning.Besides the main flat characters, the long juvenile plot, and the horrid dialogue (the women's speech and thoughts are also juvenile) there is very little historical content. And it is over four hundred pages! The time period of the book was supposedly around the 1200's but very little in the book referenced that time period, facts or customs.It read like four hundred pages of romance clich&eacute;, but I suppose some people enjoy that style, and I am not knocking them. I just prefer a bit of substance when I read, and this book does not have any.Truth be told, romances can be a bit like fantasy. However I prefer mine with a touch of reality.

review/text: First off, if you like Taylor Swift, signed Oprah's no texting pledge and enjoy watching "Dancing With The Stars", you probably won't like this album. Matter of fact, this album will be your personal anti-christ. So don't listen before going to church on Sunday. But I dare you to listen while driving home hazy at 4 am thinking woulda-coulda-shoulda thoughts when drunken spirits are dancing and the girl is crying at the bar and you struck out big time. This album is aural absinthe.Strange moods this album evokes, usually dark, eerie, weird, out-of-place, awkward, but strangely beautiful too. The soundscape reminds me of a strange man walking through mountain mist, singing to himself...people avoid him because he really has problems. He stares at you and keeps singing. Creepy cool. Wanna see the darkness? The album title is absolutely congruent with the sonics.This is one of a handful of truly classic releases in the past 10 years. Most people won't understand it, but anyone can feel it. Listen to it to calibrate your emotional gauge. Lay back, clear your head, let the mist enter your ears. If you don't feel a degree of emotional drain, then check your heart, thump it, make sure your still alive.

They worked great about 10 times, but then the batteries would not even charge. I have lots of NiCad's and even a timed charging station so they did not get over charged. These special (not to be found anywhere else) batteries are just junk. They are easy to swap, but I am not sure I want to put up with customer service or the price trying to get more.

Funny thing is I listened for 3 or 4 years before I actually listened to the lyrics too.Another KOD reviewer on Amazon had problem with some of the gay-themed lyrics. If you can't get over that, then frankly you don't deserve to hear it. The guitar effects will put you in a trance, and the songs flow together seamlessly. One of the reasons KOD didn't have mainstream success is their songs are some heavy duty songs about LOVE, both gutwrentching, and glorious.One of the top 10 CD's that changed my life.Just buy it.

review/text: I knew nothing of Robert McDuffie until I heard him perform the Mendelssohn Concerto at Wolf Trap with the National Symphony. That performance led me to seek out this CD, and McDuffie's playing here is as lovely on the disc as it was in the live performance. His tone may not be as big as Itzhak Perlman's, but it is nevertheless exquisite (the phrase &quot;spun silver,&quot; though cliched, is apt). This is true concerto playing, the soloist carrying on a conversation with the orchestra (and, by extension, with the listener). I definitely will seek out more of McDuffie's discs, and I hope others will, too.

review/text: I found this book VERY difficult to follow. It contained many typographical errors, misspellings, and inappropriate word choices and phraseology. The content was poorly organized. I had expected a cogent articulation of the situation, the facts, conclusions, and recommendations for further reseach or review. This book contained none of these. I struggled through at least one-half of the book and then gave up. I scanned the rest of the book and decided it was not worth my time. If I could return it for a refund I would do so. Having said all of this, the readers of this review need to know I am not a casual reader of books about the topic. Over the years I have read over 20 to 25 books about the assassination of JFK. I was hoping to learn something more, new, or different. I was disappointed because the author probably had something very worthwhile to say but his message was lost in his very poor presentation. My recommendation would be for him to give whatever information he collected to someone else to write.

The language is onomatapaeic in so many places and reading it out loud or, in this case, hearing it, is often the missing element you need to receive the picture Joyce is creating.

review/text: Silone's communist message is outdated.More, he makes the cardinal error to believe that solidarity is a basic human characteristic: 'Bread is made of many grains of corn, wine is made of many grapes, so it means unity. Unity of similar, equal, useful things. Hence truth and fraternity are also things that go well together.'But, man shows only solidarity if there is a 'personal' gain. Pure altruism is absolutely no option in the struggle for survival.His picture of mankind is static, too rosy and naive. His belief in the proletariat is obsessive: 'the poor are uncontaminated by greed for property.' Hence, he proposes the abolishing of private ownership of land.'Evil is only everything that prevents millions of people from becoming human.' For Silone, evil is not a basic and intrinsic part of the human character.He doesn't understand that all proletarians want their children to become (not static) doctors, engineers, lawyers, economists ..., in other words 'bourgeois'.In Stalin's Soviet Union, he sees only a fraternity of peasants and workers.The political role of the Catholic Church nowadays is marginalized. In Italy, they even don't have a Christian Party anymore.Of course, the main character poses certain questions: had that (communist) community not itself become a synagogue? abandoned the critical spirit? the risks of conspirational struggles?His answer is no. He refutes that the communists aspire too to totalitarian power and orthodoxy and that a black inquisition will be followed by a red one. His return to his homeland 'had been basically an attempt to escape that professionalism', and he has the 'hope of one day playing a big role'.Like a fanatically convinced Christian missionary, he tries desperately to sell his communist gospel to the poor cafoni. Unfortunately, they are terribly conservative ('it has always been so') and his message falls on deaf ears.What is left in this book are the struggles against a totalitarian (here fascist) regime and against the butchery of war.It is partly very melodramatic (e.g. the confession at the end) and its main symbolism (a marxist apostle disguised as a priest) irrealistic.I prefer Silone's more direct and less apostolical 'Fontamara' and recommend highly his masterpiece 'Emergency Exit'.

review/text: I always love reading the adult reviews of cartoons, especially if they never saw the cartoon as a child. Every child's movie has plot holes. Get over it. I saw this movie when I was very young and watched it a lot. I didn't like every character in the movie, including the prince. I watched it because of the unicorn. That is the point right? I mean it is about unicorns.I also love the people crying out over the two instances of 'damn' and the supposed adult situations. Do you let your children outside? Swear words are everyhere. You can't walk down the street anymore without hearing a string of them. Don't isolate your children, teach them that swear words make you look uneducated. Disney has adult situations in almost all of it's movies. In fact it is getting worse, such as the one liners that I hope go over childrens' heads. You all really need to watch the modren cartoons. There are adult themes, sex, and other subtle things around every corner. I also like the people proclaiming Disney over this movie. Disney makes people perfect, makes them all look the same and acceptable and in the end creates unbelievable happy endings. I would take a talking butterfly over the endless musical hack numbers that are jammed into any Disney film. Don't subject your children to such things. They really are more intelligent then that.The bottom line is that this movie at least has a theme that isn't sugar coated. It is approriate for children but I would watch it with children under the age of ten just because of a couple of scenes that might scare them, such as the harpie. Children's movies are silly and have plot holes and have reality issues but they are written for children - not for adults. There is a lot of good material in this movie - at the least it teaches courage. The last unicorn in the end faces her fears and wins. The plot is original and hasn't been done to death. I've never seen another movie like it and hope that no one tries to remake it. It's definitely worth at least a rental from the movie store.I have it on VHS and seeing all the comments about the DVD I would rent it from the video store or try to find it second hand. The VHS video quality is actually quite good and is not grainy at all.

review/text: I'm a pediatrician, and I did not receive any training during residency on normal infant sleep patterns. I wish I had read this book ten years ago.Dr. Weissbluth explains in a respectful tone why sleep is so important and what happens biochemically to a non-sleeping baby. It isn't always obvious to every parent that the baby needs a sleep schedule . . . this book explains not only WHY a schedule is so important, but HOW to get the baby started on one. It took a little while for my (then five month old) daughter to catch up on her sleep, and now, at nine months, she sleeps 16 out of 24 hours -- 13 hours at night plus two naps. The book is informative but not preachy. No gimmicks, just science. He endorses both "cry it out" and "soothe to sleep" techniques, discussing the merits of each, and is supportive of either crib sleeping or co-sleeping -- whatever works best for your family and parenting style. Like many self-help books, "personal stories" are included in the text, but unlike most self-help books, the stories are used to illustrate a point and not simply to self-congratulate the author. After reading four other sleep books, I've finally found the one book I can confidently recommend to my patients and my mommy friends!

review/text: i must confess that I have always been more than a little disturbed by the cover of this book. The stories featured in this book by Gogol deal with the desperate lives of the St Petersburg bureaucrats, Gogol was one and these are his people! The best story is &quot;The Diary of a Madman&quot; and this deals with the adventures of one of these low grade civil servants who finds his plans and dreams continually frustrated. As a way out he gradually becomes convinced that he is destined for &quot;bigger and better things&quot; (I will not reveal more here, but will leave this to those who will discover just what this is by reading the story). In his delusion, Gogol uses the technique of dislocation to describe the further adventures of his hapless hero and rarely is it used with greater comic effect. Tolstoy was a master of this literary device,particularly when he wanted to satirize something of which he disapproved, but Gogol perfected it. If one wants to see the beginnings of a rich tradition of humor in Russian literature, one cannot do any better than this book. I still dislike the cover and believe that the editors of Penguin may be turning away more business than they generate by the rather off-putting artwork.

That's not to say the arguments fail to persuade -- in fact, Tully presents a great deal to consider. However, for this story to gain acceptance as the definitive solution, a great many more unanswered questions and possible alternative explanations would need resolved. It's food for thought he's trying to construct as a full explanatory meal. I'd recommend borrowing it from the library before buying it, if you are considering adding it to your collection.

review/text: If the second Robocop movie has some redeemable features, then the third instalment has hardly any. This film is the metamorphous of the Robocop franchise into a kid's marketed commodity. In this respect, this film seems to be a pilot for the children-friendly television series that soon followed (though this film is not be confused WITH the actual television show pilot).The violence is low key and the inclusion of a child actor as one of the main central characters seems to confirm this. Maybe this was the inevitable conclusion - Robocop has all the hallmarks of a `superhero' and the commercialisation of this towards the children's toy market/comics may gather a new audience (young viewers) but will alienate an older audience at the same time. The superhero theme is cemented with Robocop's new jetpack and the `ninja' style villains (this movie was released when the ninja turtles franchise was in full swing).The film also lacks the budget of the first two movies, which was a surprise as Robocop 3 was very hyped up to its confusing release date (set back time after time with delays) and was released in Britain straight-to-video.This film can be viewed as a pilot, of the pilot of the tv series.

I liked the software that came with it--very easy to use. The same day I received it, the screen stopped working, but then after an hour or two, I checked it again, and it was working again. Stayed working for almost a week, in which time I filled it up with songs. It was a great little player. Once I got all the songs in, I turned it on and the screen went through some error messages. The &quot;help&quot; documentation on the CD was no help at all. I got a few ideas from the Creative web site, which got me new error screens, but I never could get my computer to recognize it again. Creative was going to have me pay for shipping to return it, but luckily Amazon recognizes that customers should be valued. I'm trying to decide whether I'll order another one or try another brand. I was surprised at how quickly I filled up 256 MB, so maybe I'll look for one with a larger capacity.

review/text: Back before all news came filtered through a television lens, hard working men and women travelled to remote locations and put themselves in harm's way to write eyewitness accounts of history for newspaper and magazine readers. This fascinating book is full of such accounts, from William Shirer's account of the 1938 Munich Conference (including his brush with a swaggering Hitler) to fascinating reports of the fall of Paris by A. J. Liebling and Virginia Cowles, to Edward R. Murrow's descriptions of war-torn but defiant London to Ernie Pyle's moving tales of soldiers in the trenches of Africa and Sicily. This book offers a unique glimpse into World War II by the people who were there, who lived through the extraordinary as well as the ordinary moments of that war. Included in this volume are incredible snapshots of the American homefront, including a report from a Japanese internment camps, as well as a &quot;report on mass murder&quot; in German concerntration camps by Ed Murrow in 1942, long before most Americans had any idea of the true horror of the holocaust. This volume explores all aspects of the war, and, as such, is an incredible historical document as well as a fascinating read. Highly recommended!

review/text: Three American explorers stumble upon a small country they dub Herland that's populated totally by women. For about two thousand years, the women have developed an intelligent, productive, perfect society, and with the entrance of the three men, they begin learning about the world outside their realm. The three men find that the women of Herland are ignorant (to their minds) of sexuality and gender roles, but the women are far ahead of the rest of the world in terms of education, child-rearing, population control, and agriculture. To fulfill their own curiosity and learn more, three women of Herland agree to become married to the three men. Unfortunately one of the men has not been able to overcome his own prejudices about how women ought to behave, and with one act he brings their time in Herland to an end. This fascinating story is decades ahead of most feminist, humanist works, and gives every reader an inspiring vision of how the world could be.

review/text: I was surprised and delighted to see this "remake". After purchasing I was, well, disappointed. I guess because the framework of the story was the same but nothing else was. The modernisation of the action was poor, the story only Ok and I didn't find it engaging except in one scene. A satisfying ending with all the story nicely wrapped up but I think the cast deserved a better story line and sticking to the original concept and doing a real remake with modern cinema techniques could have made this a four star candidate. Oh well I guess we'll never see a good modern updated version because this certainly is not it!

review/text: I have never owned a good set of cookware before purchasing the Anolon Advanced 10 pc. set. I had always owned the cheap $10-$15 per pan stuff you buy at Wal-Mart or similar stores. I was lucky and was able to find a deal on this cookware at Bed, Bath & Beyond for about $230. The choice was either Calphalon or the Anolon, and because I got the free knife and the great deal, the Anolon won out.My initial impression upon unpacking was that this stuff was very heavy. In fact, I noticed that even the 8" fry pan was heavier than my largest cheap pan from Wal-Mart. Once cleaning and reading the care instructions (who would figure you can't wash nonstick pans in the dishwasher??) I set out to create my culinary creations.One amazing aspect of these pans is that they take what seems like forever to heat up. I attribute this to the heavy and thick nature of the pans. Once heated up though, they hold heat well and have very even cooking across the entire surface, even well up into the sides. In using the covered pots, I also noticed that water boils more evenly than any pot I had owned up until now. I must say that the food came out better than ever. Clean up was also a breeze and with a little dishwashing liquid and a washcloth, every single thing on the pans wiped clean. (just like you see in the commercials that never seem to come true once you buy the product)One word of warning: if you stack pans, you need to use some heavy paper towels in between them as the edges can scratch other pans. I have been fortunate, but the heavy nature means you need to be careful. Still, if you buy thses pans, you won't regret the purchase.

review/text: Trainer was easy to put together and looks sturdy. I can't comment on how well it works because I haven't been able to use it due to the one flaw I mention in the title of the review. Nowhere does it say that your bike needs to have a rear wheel with a quick release skewer to be able to use this trainer. It wasn't until I got to that part of the installation that I realized I would need to buy a new wheel to be able to use the skewer they provide that locks into the trainer. Maybe that's an obvious thing that I should have known about, but I was unaware. I could use a new wheel so I'm not too upset about it, but you should know about this before you decide to buy the trainer.

review/text: If you have not yet read this classic, you absolutely MUST. That is all that can be said about the book itself. Its impact on popular culture alone necessitates a careful perusal.However, after paying almost $9 for this Kindle version (when I'm fairly confident that a trip to a used bookseller would have uncovered a physical copy for less than $5), I was disappointed to find 3 typographical errors in the first chapter of the book, specifically:"victory Mansions" -- On the very first page, in the very first paragraph, no less!"The instrument (the telescreen, it was called) could he dimmed" -- On the second page (depending on how large a font you use on the Kindle)."ordinary shops (' dealing on the free market', it was called)" -- I've re-created the spacing exactly as it is in this version.I can understand that the publishers are rushing to make their books available electronically, but surely, even Spellcheck would have found some of these errors. Am I the only one bemoaning the lack of craftsmanship in publishing anymore?

review/text: When you saw the previews for this movie, you probably did think it was a bunch of pretty woman dancing on a bar. It's NOT. It's a sweet story about a girl trying to seek her dream of being a songwriter. She needs to move to a new place to try to have her songs be heard, and ends up working as a coyote. Also with this tale is lots of fun and enjoyment. At the end, you can't forget when LeAnn Rimes comes in as a country music sensation (herself) and performs Violet's song she recorded. I highly suggest anyone should by this, and don't forget to pick up the soundtrack too!

review/text: LORD JIM is the story of an ordinary man who commits what may or may not be an act of cowardice and spends the rest of his life trying to atone for his sin. What makes this story extraordinary is the difficulty the reader has assessing the nature of the original act and then judging whether Jim has been punished enough. Joseph Conrad does not make it easy to gauge accurately either the man or his act since we can see the act filtered only through the lens of a narrator who is too close to the case to be judged reliable.LORD JIM is a novel of adventure and many read it on that basis, but lurking beneath the surface of a simple act is, as in so much of Conrad's fiction, a bewildering complexity of issues that tap into the deepest recesses of why people do what they do and how others can fairly judge them. Marlow is the narrator who attends the trial of a crewman Jim accused of abandoning his ship during a storm when he thought it was sinking. When all the ship's officers leap into a lifeboat they abandon the more than eight hundred passengers below decks. Jim joins them, and all are later picked up by a French trawler only to learn that their ship did not sink and in fact was safely towed to port. All the officers, except Jim, escape punishment either by running away or pleading illness. Only Jim decides to speak out publicly in his defense, but of course there is none, so he is found guilty and stripped of his seaman's certificate as punishment. Marlow sees the trial and decides to follow Jim around the world to get the truth. These are the bald facts, but what Conrad does with them is to invest them with emotional and psychological issues that resist easy analysis.To begin with, Conrad emphasizes Jim's ordinary state of being, by repeating that Jim is "one of us." This statement occurs so often that it becomes a mantra, inviting speculation as to what sense he is one of us. Whoever the "us" is, Conrad implies that the "us" must have had a standard of justice in which one size fits all. No one at the board of inquiry seems particularly upset that Jim was merely following the captain's orders to abandon ship nor that his record was otherwise flawless. The board judged Jim by an inflexible code of honor and found him wanting. Conrad, in his description of Jim as a maritime Everyman (no first name, a flat character who no past, present, and now no future), makes it easy to condemn the board's overhasty verdict to condemn Jim for an act that had mitigating circumstances. As Marlow gets to know Jim, he acknowledges that the more he knows, the less he understands. Conrad sets up a straw man in Jim. Because so many people, including Marlow, hold Jim under so many lenses, the images that result are often contradictory. The only constant is Jim himself. During the trial, and later during the climactic encounter with the natives who call him Lord Jim, Jim continues to attempt to see himself in the simplest manner possible. He knows that he cannot possibly be all the Jims floating on everyone's lips, so he determines to be the Jim who should have stayed on board the deck of a sinking ship. This Jim is willing to take responsibility for his actions. When he unwisely allows the dastardly Gentleman Brown to escape his richly deserved fate, he makes a colossal leap of faith: he will pay now for all sins of his past. In his death, Conrad suggests that this leap of faith may be the only trait that distinguishes reprobates like Brown from ordinary men like Jim who may not be so ordinary after all.

review/text: Soul Jazz records latest release, 500% dynamite, concludes the dynamite dynasty so far.It has unfortunately fallen short of the rockin' standards that have been the key to success of the previous compilations.It's focus has turned towards a more modern dancehall ragga, that somehow isn't as melodic or liberating as previous ska, reggae, soul, and funk that compiles these albums.400% dynamite featured a few inclinations toward a ragga style content,with tunes such as Buju Banton's remix of &quot;ring the alarm&quot;.This is a top tune, with a ranging beat, of great originality and very stirring.Unlike the ragga that ranges on 500% dynamite, which lacks inherent jamaican soul.The majority of this compilation is ragga and i think this reflects the record label's desire to captivate music of a more modern era.Soul jazz records have perhaps reached the capacity of their music vaults, when it comes to the old, traditional music that made the dynamite series become &quot;dynamite&quot;, with soothing rocksteady, funky, soulful reggae and storming, hip-moving ska.Let's hope that the next album rediscovers its classical touch.When passion ignites: &quot;dynamite&quot;...Explodes!

I don't know why Keanu was cast in this role but he's the worse actor in the entire movie and Shia LaBeouf is almost as bad as he is and gives a very annoying performance that reeks of stupidity.

review/text: The American consumer public are no fools. We know how to spend our dollars wisely, where to invest and what to avoid. So when this Francis Lawrence-helmed apocalyptic "thriller" topped weekend box office charts during its initial release, there's no way that money could've been directed towards the wrong feature, right?Yes and no. Let's start with the yes and get it over with. First off, very impressive visual effects. From the exorcism in the beginning of the movie, to our little hero's ventures into hell, to the wings of Gabriel. (Btw, it is very interesting to note how Gabriel is depicted as genderly ambiguous) Rachel Weisz has a very smooth way to her acting, as if she can do it so easily and flawlessly, you actually believe her character as an L.A. policewoman haunted by the mysterious death of her twin sister. Shia Laboeuf has a bit of a minor role, but he makes the most of it, shining with that unintended humor of his character, Constantine's "slave" chaffeur, Chas Kramer.Now, the no part. Hollywood seems to love declaring Keanu Reeves as our savior, the hero who didn't want to be a hero, called upon to save the world in one way or another. Whether it be in the machine-run era of "The Matrix", or a police officer trying to stop a madman from doing terrorist deeds in "Speed." And now, again, Reeves is called upon to save us from a clash between heaven and hell! John Constantine, a reluctant hero who has selfish ends, feeling sorry for himself, blah blah... Reeves may or may not put his all into this role, but as we all know by now, his best is never good enough. Constantine's persona is too flat, not captivating enough, further brought down by that annoying monotone drawl of Reeves' voice, and constantly needs support from the other characters in the film. Even the 20-second flashbacks of his childhood we see aren't enough to garner attention or pity for this soul branded for hell.The worst of it is that we expect this hero to maintain and carry along what little plot there is, stretched out over 2 hours. Honestly, folks, there is not much going on here. The filmmakers probably made about 5 storyboards and decided to make each one 20 minutes long. Inbetween the grueling beginning and the much-anticipated end, there's a whole lot of nothing eye-candy that manages to transfix into a bit of something, but not enough. Somehow we get from the death of a psychiatric patient to the end of the world...? And even when the movie's over, there's STILL unanswered questions. I don't mean, "Oh, will Angela and John get together?" nonsense but "Uh what happened to the dead sister??" No doubt saving for an equally painful sequel.So don't waste your money on this over-budgeted Keanu-promoting campaign...oh, oh I mean, thriller! "The Seventh Seal," "12 Monkeys," good flicks. Not this. No.

review/text: The little squeegy bug didn't know who or what he was. He wasn't an ant or a cricket or even a flea and he wanted to find his purpose in life. When he met Buzzer the Bumblebee, he decided he wanted to be special, just like him. But how could he find a pair of silver wings and a stinger? Buzzer tells Squeegy he'll have to touch the sky to get a beautiful pair of silver wings like his. So that's just what he tried to do. He spent three days climbing the tallest thing he knew of, a cattail, certain it must touch the sky. But on the third evening, he was caught in a terrible storm and saved from certain disaster by a very nice caterpillar, who took him in and gave him a place to sleep. The next morning, the two travel to the web at the very end of the cattail and consult with the all-knowing, Haunchy the Spider. Haunchy weaves Squeegy a beautiful pair of silver wings for his back. But there is no stinger. Instead, Haunchy reaches up and grabs the brightest star in the night sky, attaches it to Squeegy's bottom and names him Squeegy the Firefly, the Lamplighter of the Sky..... Originally published in 1946, Bill Martin Jr, Michael Sampson and Pat Corrigan have teamed up to create this new version of a timeless classic. Their gentle, magical, understated text is enhanced by their high-tech geometric illustrations and together they've authored an innovative and creative story that will mesmerize youngsters with its simple message and bright, bold, textured artwork. Perfect for kids 4-8, The Little Squeegy Bug is an uplifting treasure to read and share again and again, and pass down from one generation to the next.

review/text: I usually write reviews of books that deal with theology and Christian apologetics and other really side-splitting kinds of subjects that, I suspect, provide endless amusement and delight to both of the people who have read them.But I'm wandering outside my usual field because I found this history of a culturally influential television institution to be quite interesting. It is, at times, funny and-reflecting the reality of what happened-at times, sad."Live From New York" basically tells the story of how Saturday Night Live started and it takes the reader through the various eras of the show.It seems that I'm in the minority among many of the people I know, but I think some of the more recent eras of the show and some of the more recent mixes of cast members are just as funny-and perhaps even funnier-than the early days with Belushi, Akroyd, Chase, and the gang. My friends who disagree with this assessment will, no doubt, snort and wave their hands dismissively. Sometimes I say things that these people disagree with just to watch the snorting and hand waving. When you lead a slow-paced life, little things go a long way.In telling SNL's history, the book relies heavily on quotes from numerous cast members and writers, past and present. The behind-the-scenes stories of various people who have been involved with the show over the years are captivating for someone like myself who has enjoyed watching SNL in its various permutations over the past several decades.

review/text: I have been homeschooling our five children for the past fifteen years and consider this book and "One Minute Philosopher" to be the two most useful books for adulthood that my children read in high school. The ABC's, written by a well-balanced father of eight, and a former military man, examines many factors which contribute to marital stability or instability, including family finances, premarital and contraceptive sex, dealing with family dysfunction before the wedding, premarital inventories to examine compatibility, warning signs, getting parental opinions on potential mate, online dating and many other factors.Wood bases some of his advice on research and some on his experiences. He has an experienced, fatherly perspective, and cheers a couple on to get the support and necessary skills they need to have a stable, loving marriage. Although some of his opinions are not mandated by Catholic teaching, they are based on either traditional practices, such as involving the family in the process, or modern research, such as the use of a premarital questionnaire to indicate compatibility or lack of it.I highly recommend this book for those who are looking for practical Catholic advice from an experienced husband and father.

Next, he meets a girl but won't tell her that he loves her. Later, the man kills an Arab on a beach and is put in prison. While in his trial the man is bored and is eventually sentenced to have his head cut off. While waiting for his execution, he tells the chaplain that he doesn't believe in God and never will. The book ends with him in prison, waiting hopelessly for his execution.I did not particularly like this book. It is boring to read a book when the character has no emotion.

Aside from being one of the first animated British feature films, as a poignant parable, it so perfectly explains how the Russian Revolution turned a bad situation into one of the three worst of the 20th century (the others being Nazi Germany and Communist China). Reviewers harping on the film's "upbeat" ending sound unaware of just how prophetic that ending turned out to be (remember what happened to Soviet Communism in 1989). This is a great film which -- incredibly -- may have now slipped into the public domain. (...)

review/text: This is an outstanding collection of the best know shorter works by Steinbeck, or more accurately a collection of his novellas. The writing is exceptional and this is a highly recommended buy.The stories are short and they cannot be compared with his best known novel "Grapes of Wrath." But this is a superb collection containing his best short work and first novel "Of Mice and Men." Also, it contains "Cannery Row," another great story. And, it has his interesting novel "The Moon is Down." It is about resistance to an invading force. We can assume that it is probably Norway during World War II, and their resistance to Germany, but Steinbeck keeps it a bit vague which broadens the appeal of the book. It could apply to any invading force.John Steinbeck (1902 - 1968) was among the best known American writers of the 20th century. He won the 1962 Nobel Prize for literature. His 1939 Pulitzer Prize winning novel, "Grapes of Wrath" has over ten million copies in print.Steinbeck was born in rural California, went to Stanford, and spent most of his life in California. He has been associated with the plight of farm workers and others. His books have been very popular and many were made into movies and stage productions. He won an Academy Award nomination for best story in 1944.I have read a number of his novels and am still surprised with the quality of his work - especially his short stories and short novels, so the present collection is a great buy.The collection has his famous short works and is not a heavy read. Each of the works takes one evening to read. I liked all the stories. Readers will appreciate the clarity of the prose, the characters, and the messages. This is a great value purchase and an interesting reading experience.

review/text: As far as documentaries go, this one isn't very good. I was expecting to see a film on the rise and fall of an internet company. Instead, I got CEO and buddy yell into a phone. I was very disappointed not to find out about the day-to-day operations of the company, what the 200+ employees did all day while Kaleil was meeting with VC's, or why they waited until the night before the launch to first test their site (sheesh, no wonder the business failed). Even knowing WHO the employees were would have been nice. Otherwise, it makes Kaleil and Tom's talk of being a family, not a company, sound hollow.Even for what it was trying to do, by focusing on the two founders and their relationship, it didn't do very well. There was so much I didn't know about Tom and Kaleil, no background information was given other than they had known each other since high school. Where did they go to college? We find out Kaleil left his investment banking job to work on govworks.com but what did Tom do before? How did Kaleil come up with the idea of a website to pay parking tickets? Who were the other founders and what were their roles in the company and relationship with Kaleil and Tom? Why should we care about these guys? I quickly found myself not caring about them, their company, or thier dog.This could have been a good documentary if the directors had been more focused. So much was left unexplained, I was more confused at the end then enlightened - not a good sign for a documentary. I give it 2 stars, one for Tom's daughter (very cute little girl) and one for giving me a chance to laugh at two of the fools who ruined our previously healthy economy.

At first I thought her eyes looked kind of wierd, but if you look really closley, you see those beautiful melt- your-heart blue eyes all of the older versions had. I already asked my mom if I could have her for Christmas! She even comes with a DVD! Cool! I also want the carrier. I can't wait! Perfect doll for any age!

review/text: This is the greatest comedy ever made. It deserves better treatment than it was given by this DVD. The colours are not as good as the video version. There are no interviews, no &quot;the making of&quot;, no real special features at all. Why was Angela Lansbury not interviewed for this? She narrates the special features for The Wizard of Oz and she wasn't even in that movie! Could no one be found who is still alive to discuss this picture? This film deserves much more attention &amp; credit than it has received.

review/text: I really was looking forward to the release of this CD and must say was a little disappointed the first time I listened to it. I liked Invisible and This is the Night because they were familiar but was hoping for other songs Clay sang on American Idol. However, after listening to the CD several times, I can't decide which song is my favorite. I listen to it over and over at work. The thing that I find incredible is that I never get tired of listening to it like I do my other CDs. It gets better every time I hear it.

review/text: I had to read this book for my History 1302 class and I must say I'm glad I chose this book out of all the others. The book was very easy to read, however, it sometimes gets confusing when all the facts about poverty are referenced at the same time. Although this book is short, at certain times it feels like Harrington is dragging out his ideology. Nonetheless, This book opened my eyes to the poverty in America not only in the past, but at its' present state.

The collection starts you off with these games:Pac ManGalagaDig DugPole PostionGalaxianMs. Pac ManThat right there is worth your money. But Namco also put in updated versions of Pac Man, Galaga, Dig Dug and Pole Postion!! That's right, if you get bored with the oldies, try out the newies. They show better power-ups and graphics.The collection doesn't stop there. If you are a Pac Attack fan (which I am), then you will play Pac Man for a while. You have to score a whopping 20,000 points to unlock Pac Attack. But wait, there is even a secret for Ms. Pac Man! Score 15,000 points and get Pac Mania, one of the best games in the series. So here's the entire collection with brief decriptions:Pac Man (Eat ghosts, chomp dots)Pac Man ArrangementGalaga (Shoot the Galagas)Galaga ArrangementDig Dug (Pump the enemies along the way as you dig through dirt)Dig Dug ArrangementPole Postion (Qualify for a main race and finish laps)Pole Postion 2Galaxian (Just like Galaga, shoot Galaxians)Ms. Pac Man (Same as Pac Man)Pac Attack (Locked, is sort of like Tetris)Pac Mania (Locked, Pac Man only 3D, and he can jump!)There you go, 12 unforgettable classics packed into one disc!

review/text: Clay Aiken's frist CD is outstanding. It has a bit of everything on it- some rock, some pop, AC, jazzy and some Latin tones. I love every songs on it. He has a great voice and can sing almost any genre of music. My favorite is &quot;Measure of a Man&quot;, beautiful lyrics and showcase his voice very well. Another favorite is &quot;The Way&quot;, so sensual it sends chills up my veins. Also &quot;Touch&quot; is very sexy and has a good beat.I was so tired of most of the pop music out there so I am glad Clay brought back good music into my life.For those that like the Beatles, Elton John, Journey and soft rock oldies, this album is for you!

review/text: I've had shirts custom tailored for me while overseas, often with fine, imported fabric. These shirts, stitched in Vietnam, rival the best custom shirts. The collars are extremely clean looking, and lay down well. The 'tonal diagonal' fabric has subtle darker pistripes every 1/16" and, every 3/4", a diagonal angled row of slightly raised, slightly lighter stitches. Hard to describe! But from mirror distance it is highly professional, not too showy look. Also comfortable looking, as well as to wear. I also like the long tail of the shirt to prevent pull outs. I am on line today to order several more of each. I prefer the tonal diagonal myselfbut presume that fabric and tailoring are of similar quality across the line.(The French cuff variety if this shirt is a real bargain. I recently paid $80 for a similar shirt, and am not highly impressed with the fabric. The 60-40 blend makes the shirt relax a bit more than the all-cottons one I have. )

review/text: At first I was forced to read &quot;The Mayor of Casterbridge&quot; in school more than 12 years ago. Reading it slowly made an impact on my life. This book always served a special purpose in my life. It introduced me to the wide world of Literature. It sort of enlighten my interest and liking for English literature. Now re-reading it not only brought back fond memories of my yester school days but also renewed my liking to one of the greatest writer of all time Thomas Hardy.Through this novel I came to the understanding of Irony and oxymoron. Hardy totally wrote with a sense of awareness of human characteristic and he had a amazing style of mixed humour with tragedy.His protagonist,Michael Henchard's life was under the microscope of Hardy.I love the way the story began I quote:&quot;ONE evening of late summer, before the nineteenth century had reached one-third of its span, a young man and woman, the latter carrying a child, were approaching the large village of Weydon-Priors, in Upper Wessex, on foot. &quot; I love the Englishness and the sense of intriguing events that would follow...In brief, Michael Henchard was a drunk who sold his wife and daughter at the fair. Later he realised his mistakes he work real hard and eventually became the mayor of Casterbridge. His life took another twist 20 years later when his wife and daughter came back to his life plus a few more other characters adding on the complexity of his life.Soonafter events unfolded and many things became to go against his way and then came his downfall. Indeed Michael Henchard's rise and fall were filled with compelling details and his encounters with numerous intestering people.What I love most about this novel was the way Hardy depicted Henchard's behaviours and thoughts and totally enhanced his weak character and irresponsibleness with dashes of ironies. His sardonic literary style were brilliant and at the same time he also vividly described the scenery and situations. Another greatest of Hardy was his ability to create innovative characters still account for in modern contemporary days and he was a pioneer in analysising human's weakness and blended it into his creation. It's a vintage classic,psychoanalytic and intriguingly written ,a must read for all books lover.

review/text: This is my favorite book of all time.Lots of reviewers are complaining about the scientific accuracy of the novel. Hello! The book was written in 1984! That was 20 years ago! Science changes every day.Besides, watching a national geographic special on neanderthals doesn't may you an expert on human evolution. So unless, you're a physical anthropologist or a microbiologist. Please be quiet.The Earth Children's series has impacted my life in two ways: It's why I minored in lingustic anthropology in college (I actually wrote a paper on the Neanderthal language) and why I got a dog (Wolf is the best).Ayla is amazing, I suppose a little too amazing at times, but she is really a symbol of major milestones in human evolution and culture (domestication of animals, usefulness of flint in starting a fire, the idea that sex makes babies, and an explanation for the extinction of Neanderthals (they intermated with modern Homo sapiens).My favorite Earth Children's in order...1)Clan of the Cave Bear2) The Mammoth Hunters3)Shelters of Stone4) Plains of Passage5) Valley of Horses (just get through this, it's worth it)

review/text: I borrowed this video from the local library. The video could be used to teach beginners to classic cross-country ski provided there was an experienced instructor doing narration, otherwise you may put the class to sleep. The footage consists of long and repeated shots of a single skier traditional skiing, to soft almost hypnotic music in the background. The video is somewhat dated in its technique, equipment and filmmaking, and would be hard pressed to compete with modern videos the likes of Warren Miller (Alpine), Christian Begin (Mtn Biking) or xczone (cross-country skiing).

Not having watched this series on tv as we do not have cable or an atenna in our home i was unaware of the skanky nature of this season. The intellegence and absence of immorality that i have seen on the few episodes i watched outside the home caused me to purchase. I am extremely disappointed in this episode and the following one. The rounchyness far out weighed the intellegence by far. Now i am very very leary about purchasing any other episodes. I did enjoyed episode one which i borrowed from my neice. The moral deploriaty is why we do not have cable or an atenna in our house. These have gone to the trash as is fitting for such lack of marality.

review/text: I read this book out loud to my family of boys over the span of one week. They liked it very well -- even the littlest brother could follow the story, even though there are no illustrations.It's a story of adventure and hidden strength, as a beloved nanny gives William a play castle with a surprise inside -- a miniature, living knight! The nanny and the 10-year-old child become miniaturized as well, and the adventure to rescue the kingdom from an evil wizard commences.There was a long, slow build-up to the action in this story -- lots of school days, and afternoons in the attic, and gymnastics practices, and long discussion. Only the final 7 chapters detail the real adventure -- the first 10 are just warm-ups.Parent notes:*A lot of lying. A *lot* of lying. William (the child protagonist) lies almost constantly through the beginning of the book.*Absent parents rely on a nanny so they can pursue their careers. In fact, the son makes pointed remarks about how the dad never keeps his promises.*Great knightly values: Be compassionate to the needy. Neither squander wealth nor hoard it. Never lose your sense of shame. If questions are asked of you, answer them frankly but do not ask too many yourself. Be manly and of good cheer. Never kill a foe who is begging for mercy. Be ever loyal in love.*William seems totally unfamiliar with the interiors of churches. He meets Sir Simon in a chapel and acts as though he has never seen a cross or smelled incense or noticed how altar candles flicker. Being in the chapel makes William feel small and quiet, and he recognizes it as a holy place, but that's it. All the praying he does consists of supplications to his nanny, spoken aloud in times of trouble, although she is far away.*One scary scene, when William encounters the dragon, describes an illusion he sees of his nanny burning to death. Another scary scene describes the horrifying process of a person being turned to lead from the feet up.As a parent, I give this book 3.5 stars. My kids liked the adventure and the setting of the castle and the kingdom... and truly, the final 7 chapters were very fun to read out loud. From a values standpoint, this book wouldn't be my favorite choice for modeling my children's behavior.I prefer Mary Stewart's "A Walk in Wolf Wood" as a fictional castle adventure to be read and re-read.

review/text: I first found Christine Feehan's work through 'Dark Prince'. It was an excellent read and has had me hooked on the whole series! I thought this book would be the same - not even close. The Scarlatti Curse is humdrum. Before I reached halfway I really didn't care about the characters. The secondary characters were underdeveloped and the main characters were two dimensional. I also did not get a feeling for the period or the place. In short it seemed like a short story plot that was enlarged to take advantage of her success with the Carpathian series. Please Christine don't write any more like this.

Tess has lived on a desolate island ever since she was a little girl, raised by its caretakers who are now dead, leaving 17-year-old Tess alone. She is rescued by Colin MacPherson, a handsome young Highlander, who takes her back to the mainland. He tries to help her find her heritage, but the two end up falling in love.

review/text: I buy a lot from Amazon, but I don't write a lot of reviews. This rice cooker, however, is amazing. I got it overnight, just unpacked it, and made delicious, chewy, creamy, nutty steel cut oats in about an hour. Use 1 rice cooker cup of McCann's oats, 3 rice cooker cups of water, select the porridge setting, and come back in about an hour. Stir in the juice that rises to the top and enjoy. Brown rice pudding is next. I have to get up really early some days, and I can't wait to pre-program in a hot breakfast. Think of it as a slow cooker for people with a sense of urgency!The ZCC10 is extremely well made and easy to clean. I also recommend the Ultimate Rice Cooker Cookbook by Hensperger and Kaufmann, which has lots of good ideas for rice and more.So far, the only thing I can see to look out for is to make sure that you measure consistently. Use the 180 ml rice cooker cups for the grain and the water, or use larger kitchen cups for the grain and the water to get the right ratio. Also, the unit comes with a nubby plastic spatula/scraper thingy that won't mar the nonstick finish of the bowl. Cleaning is a breeze with cold water and a microfiber cloth.It's a little pricey, but well worth it because it has just about every setting you'll need to make more than just plan rice.Here's the cookbook link:The Ultimate Rice Cooker Cookbook : 250 No-Fail Recipes for Pilafs, Risottos, Polenta, Chilis, Soups, Porridges, Puddings and More, from Start to Finish in Your Rice Cooker

Every song hits a chord with a certain emotion or memory whereby the songs become a conduit for thought and musing. Some songs have a Beatlesuqe feel and others bring Dylan to mind but Kelly's lyrics and his unique voice make the music clearly his own.

review/text: The most valuable thing in this book is a longish list of sleep hygiene tips nestled within the four week progeram. It includes things like replacing all the bulbs in your bedroom to those that put out a maximum of forty watts, and taking a power down hour before bed where nothing can be done but mindless chores, hygiene, and stretching. The rest of the book is filled with product plugs and unnecessary facts. The four week program would cause even more anxiety in me about sleeping. For a truly wonderful book on sleep, and one that will help those already on medications without lambasting them, try the Insomnia Answer by Paul Glovinsky.

review/text: How often have you encountered a book on Shakespeare or his works that attains a level of writing that is often heart-meltingly gorgeous, even at times comparable to the beauty of the Shakespeare quotations it contains? Probably only once, and this is the book.A helpful introduction by David Lehman reminds us that Mark Van Doren was a celebrated professor of literature at Columbia University, and a poet of considerable accomplishment, who served as mentor to a long list of students who later achieved great things. In his courses he generally spoke without notes, and this 1939 book on Shakespeare's works was also written without notes or references, other than a well-thumbed one-volume edition of the works, printed in about 1906.Any modest power of description which I might possess fails utterly for this exquisite book. Instead, let me give a sample of Van Doren's commentary: "It may well be that Shakespeare in 'The Tempest' is telling us for the last time, or consciously for the last time, about the world. But what he is telling us cannot be simple, or we could agree that it is this or that. Perhaps it is this: that the world is not simple. Or, mysteriously enough, that it is what we all take it to be. Any set of symbols, moved close to this play, lights up as if in an electric field. Its meaning, in other words, is precisely as rich as the human mind, and it says that the world is what it is. But what the world is cannot be said in a sentence. Or even in a poem as complete and beautiful as 'The Tempest.'"

review/text: ... but did you also know you need it? Why? Because on a top end machine the following games have settings that go way past the limitations of even this card - Microsoft Flight Simulator 2004, Doom 3, FarCry and the soon to be released Half-Life 2. These are all new engines that will drive the games of tomorrow, meaning that I will probably be trading this one in for Xmas 2005 when the 512 line should make its mark. Anyway how does this card pan out?First of all it is a nightmare if you setup your card on a television and then forget to change it back for use with a monitor. So learn a lesson well about these monitor/television compatible cards. Make sure to change the Display Properties to whichever type you are using next because if you don't then you will not see anything and thus can not change it back. Next you need to know that these cards are top of line and make quite a great deal of noise. We are talking about listening to something like a 50cfm fan in your box doing the rounds. You are probably going to want to run your box cooler with these types of high-end chipsets running to get the most out of them so go searching on the net for a good environmental setup.All these new series of graphics card come with DirectX 9.0c or higher but the real key to unlock this God is with the new ATI range of drivers that enhance and accelerate the visual experience - CATALYST (Basically complete Real-time 3D immersive game play*). The four games for this card I have already mentioned (Playing it with Counter-Strike: Source is extremely good although I believe maybe a 128mb would give virtually the same playability for now). So if you want those games then consider this card.FarCry has an exceptional environment with something like X100 zoom on your binoculars. The enemy AI is unreal but in terms of graphics it is a real ride with this card. I believe you need this card for the full FarCry experience; however I do not believe that it pushes this card to its limit.MS Flight Simulator 2004 does push this card past it limits. Put everything up full in the details panel and look out the window over populated areas. You will see a delay and suddenly several sectors start to pop up. A 512mb card will make that game real-time.Doom3 has the ability to actually configure to a 512mb card if one existed now. Doom3 is an experience and a half, not 100% but unlike anything you have seen before and pretty scary to say the least. Anyway with this card the demon disintegration graphics are akin to watching someone getting beamed up in front of you. The lighting dynamics are also crucial to the game play. Get Doom 3 and this card and you will be stunned by something that looks like an XBOX 2 or PS3.Half-Life 2 is not yet released (Nov. 16th 2004 release date) but if you buy the new Bronze edition from Steam you can DL the encrypted HL2 files onto your HD along with CS: Source and Play Source right away which is a big improvement on any version of CS you have seen. Anyway it looks top spec on this card but I believe a 128mb card can play Source at it highest settings. Anyway the point is to look for the HL2 video and know that in reality HL2 is going to cost you $300 if you want the full experience.It's a tough cookie but let's face it. You have no choice. Now go work or Beg for it. We all did it!*As for using unsupported ATI drivers for this card. Well even Catalyst is unsupported (Use at your own risk from ATI sort of thing) so hammering around with this card is probably not a bad idea however it is always useful to do that after the card has passed its warranty but the choice is there is you want it. Personally I would stick to the ATI releases and get some good tutorials on your computer environment5 Stars but an XBOX is almost the same price.

review/text: I originally purchased this book when I became a competition team member for the trial advocacy program at my law school. When I thought about an objection that I could make, or that would be made against my case I turned to this book. I would turn to the objection or issue and there would be the relevant federal rule of evidence easily laid out and explained. Most beneficial is the explanation on not only how to MAKE the objection to the court but then how to properly RESPOND to the objection. This book is helpful as I would know how to properly make the argument to the judge/court. It was also helpful to read over/review the book and look at the objections to get an idea of if you could use something else in your case. At the end of the book it also has the complete federal rules of evidence. I can't say more amazing things about this book, BUY IT BUY IT BUY IT!

review/text: Originally written by Mildred Wirt Benson from outlines by Edward Stratemeyer, the Nancy Drew series was first published in 1930s. THE SECRET OF RED GATE FARM was the sixth book in the series, and like the earlier books it presented its heroine as a rich, headstrong, and distinctly reckless teenager who sometimes carried a pistol and who wasn't above breaking the law when it suited her purposes.As the series progressed and other writers began to generate Nancy Drew novels, the character changed and Nancy was "toned down;" instead of flatly rich, she became reasonably affluent; recklessness was replaced by commonsense caution; and while she might be willing to bend the law a bit she would never knowingly break it. In the 1950s and 1960s the earlier novels were re-written to reflect this change in character.Originally published in 1931, RED GATE FARM was re-written in 1961--but unlike several other re-written titles the story remains much the same. In this instance, Nancy and her friends Bess and George visit Red Gate Farm, where owner Mrs. Byrd is in financial difficulty and has rented a portion of the land to a religious cult. When Nancy becomes curious, she and her friends are threatened by the cult members--and they decide to infiltrate the group's strange gatherings.It is worth noting that the cult, which is called The Black Snake Cult, dresses in white robes with odd, peaked hoods, and Nancy and the girls consider disguising themselves with sheets and pillowcases the better to spy upon their activities. Given the era of the book's first publication and later re-write, this would seem to be a subconcious reference to the Klu Klux Klan on the author's part! As always in the original series, the story is very much of its era: there are no cell phones, computers, or modern gadgets, and Nancy is very much an ideal of the time: she can sew, herd a cow, treat a snakebite, and still seem to dress appropriately for all social occasions.The Nancy Drew books are not great literature by any stretch of the imagination--they are too distinctly formula for that--but they are competently written, literate, and never talk down to their target audience. They are also good "comfort reading" for grown-ups who recall their childhood reading fondly. RED GATE FARM is an amusing read for old fans and newcomers alike.GFT, Amazon Reviewer

review/text: The Other Boleyn Girl is a good read. The author is a very able storyteller, allowing us a glance into the interiors of Tudor England and Henry VIII's court. Her characters are mostly to be pitied as we see the push and pull of great families vying for political and social dominance in the realm. In this society, daughters are bought and sold like prized cattle, their families acknowledging that they were no more than pawns in the courtly game.No one knows much about the life of Mary Boleyn, however the major events and general outline of her life are understood and followed somewhat accurately in this novel. Because of this obscurity, Philippa Gregory uses it to her advantage and invents the feelings and emotions of those around her, at the same time giving us a fresh look into the events surrounding her family and of course her sister. Gregory may take too many liberties with the attitude of the characters; she shapes Anne Boleyn into a hateful devil-woman and perhaps allows Mary to be a bit too innocent. Other than those issues the only problem I had with the book were technical.Her use of adverbs is incessant, everyone always replies harshly, coyly, triumphantly, and miserably, coldly, etc. You get the idea. The other problem I noticed was some time period inconsistencies. Obviously it is a historical novel, but there are many times when she will laps into modern phrases and ideas, I know she must do this to get her point across, but it sticks out like a sore thumb. For instance: "Mary went downstairs to get a pen and paper to write a note to the king". I don't believe in sixteenth century anywhere the use of pens or paper was existent. Maybe she could have said a quill and parchment or something. Anyway that is just one example and for all of these discrepancies.She makes up for it with her ability to tell a story and her written dialog I found myself wrapped up in the exchanges, they were wonderful and quick. The voice of her characters really comes out here.I would recommend this book to anyone who is a fan of historical fiction, or anyone who is interested in this time period. It is a fresh perspective into the life of an obscure woman and a lesson on the treatment and role of women in this society.

The shiny top piece is poorly glued on, and pops up rubbing against the record while its playing. This causes the record to wobble and creates a very poor sound. I had to put a weight on the player to keep the piece from popping up in order for it to play properly. Little to say I will be staying away from numark products, and I highly recommend that anyone in the market for a player such as this look else where.

review/text: I am a faculty member at a law school. When we considered revamping our curriculum, I gave the committee members passages from this book to read, where the Academy's approach is made clear. Universally, the response was: &quot;Yeah, that's how we should do things. But we have to pursue a feel-good approach now.&quot; Heinlein understands that character matters, and that institutions should encourage responsibility, not undermine it. That, I suppose, is why he was never an administrator.... Nonetheless, this is not only a terrific story, but one -- like all of Heinlein's juniors -- with a point.

review/text: This well-rounded collection of the better-known short works of Jean Sibelius is very well served by conductor Osmo V&auml;nsk&auml; and the Lahti Symphony Orchestra. It is one of those CDs for both the passionate lover of Sibelius' music as well as a very fitting introduction to those who for some reason have not placed the great Finnish composer in their collection of recordings. While many of the works fall into the 'pops' category (well known from frequent exposure) such as 'Finlandia', 'The Swan of Tuonela' from the Lemmink&auml;inen, 'Valse Triste', and 'Tapiola', there are some significant works less well known in the concert halls. One of the more poignant of these is the 'Death of Melisande' from the Pell&eacute;as et M&eacute;lisande incidental music - an example of the fine works for theater Sibelius composed ('The Tempest' being another of these rarely performed works). V&auml;nsk&auml; and his orchestra give solid performances here, somehow making this collection cohesive.Jean Sibelius is growing in respect as one of the more important composers linking the Romantics with the Moderns and we are left to wonder what would have come from him had he not ceased composing for the last decades of his life (he died in 1957). For the past weeks the audiences for the Los Angeles Philharmonic have been blessed with Esa Pekka Salonen's survey of his fellow countryman's genius in a series he titled 'Sibelius Unbound'. The survey included all seven symphonies and some tone poems and excerpts (one of those being the luminous 'Death of Melisande') and as Salonen approaches age fifty he has become the foremost interpreter of Sibelius' music. Hearing all seven symphonies performed by the brilliant LA Phil in Disney Hall was indeed a revelation - and more profound and integrated renderings of the works will probably not be heard again. One only can hope that Salonen and the LA Phil will record the Sibelius cycle: it would doubtless be a cycle without peer. Grady Harp, November 07

review/text: I am not saying that this is a bad movie or bad story... not at all. But here are the disappointments that might hit you:1. One of things that might disappoint the audience is that it cannot be easily swallowed after Russel's great movie &quot;Gladiator&quot;. 2. Second when you say Al Pacino, we remember his greatests &quot;Heat&quot; or &quot;Devil's Advocate&quot;. So this movie does not easily fit with many of his great movies.So the success of this movie is no more determined by the actors past successful history, but only if the story is good or not. And yes the story was good and had its certain type of suspense but it gets in a frame that we all knew about this story and now it has got out.In other words, we always believed that smoking cigarettes is an addiction. No this film told us why and how. So it's not new, but now it is out.I see that this type of story needed not such expensive great actors except to attract more audience!

Raymond Chandler's prototypes for his now famous detective began in the mid-30's with characters from some of his early pulp magazine stories. Whether the character is Ted Carmady, Johnny Dalmas, John Evans, Tony Resick or a character named simply Mallory, they all had the qualities and charactoristics that eventually evolved into what became Philip Marlowe. Red Wind, Trouble Is My Business and Goldfish are just three of more than 40 stories Chandler wrote during his lifetime. Don't miss a single one!

review/text: This book is so boring that doctors should recommend it to those with insomnia because it'll put you right to sleep. Billed as an erotic book of essays, it did not succeed with its task.The author seems to dwell in his promiscuity, but bores us with stories about his furniture and odd stains on his upholstery instead of telling us how those stains got there.In another essay he tells of his dying lover in the hospital and the last time they performed together, then, at the funeral, his lover's nurse comes to tell him that he was &quot;with&quot; the lover several times--and the author thought that was comforting. Yet there were no details of any of these couplings.There is a point when trying to write erotica intelligently, which I am all for, that the writer inadvertantly eradicates all hints of passion and heat. The author completely leaves his readers cold and unmoved and still not in the mood, which is unfortunate. This book could have been very steamy and still maintained its dignity had the writer moved into the scenes and relived the physicality of his sessions. But no, we are to read about distant memories that have no feeling or touch attached.Instead of this book being labeled and marketed as erotica, it should have been listed as autobiographic...and if these are the highlights of a life, I feel sorry for the subject--how can one lead a life so boring?

review/text: I bought this book last night and finished it this morning. It was different from some of the JAK books because there is no paranormal element, but rather the two main characters more or less were dealing with post traumatic stress syndrome, one from being a marine in wartime and the other from finding her parents murdered. The book was JAK at her best, funny and touching. Her banter and repartee are at their finest.One thing that hits me as I'm writing the review is how I wasn't bothered by some of the subject matter that the book dealt with as I am with other romance writers. Perhaps that's due to the fact that it wasn't revealed until the end or just that JAK handles it more sublimely than other authors. She's not all gore and prurience for the sake of gore and prurience. Thanks for that, JAK!

review/text: Rarely does a movie live up to its hype. This is one of the exceptions.If you didn't catch this movie in theatres buy it now. It's not only as good as you've heard, it's actually even better. For the first time, a Batman film has succeeded completely in capturing all of the elements of the fabled comic book character while also producing a Batman that seems fully grounded in reality.Let's face it, though the Tim Burton Batman movies have a large and devoted following, those movies are ultimately less about the Dark Knight and more about Burton's ongoing fascination with offbeat characters and the bizarre. Joel Schumacher's "Batman Forever" was an enjoyable if overly campy romp but by "Batman & Robin" this series had collapsed under the weight of too many villains, sidekicks, and corny dialogue. It's telling that on the recent DVD special edition of that film even Schumacher admits that movie stunk and issues a public apology for running this series into the ground.This meant that "Batman Begins" director Chris Nolan had a hell of a task on his hands when he took the reins of this film: Deliver a Batman film for the 21st Century and restore credibility to the character.The idea of going back to the character's origins was a master stroke and serves the story well. Here we get the most detailed on-screen documentation of Batman's beginnings ever shown and damned if it all doesn't come off as more than a little epic. Much credit must also go to Christian Bale in the title role.It helps that Bale is the first Batman who is diesel enough to play the role without the benefit of a muscled, rubberized suit. Seriously, you could probably crack walnuts on this guy's abs.It helps that he also looks good in a tuxedo. The whole appeal of Batman was always that as Bruce Wayne by day, he was the biggest playboy this side of James Bond. But by night he was an obsessive revenge freak bent on striking at criminals from the shadows. Bale's got the acting chops and the look to nail this in a minute.The movie also benefits from a strong supporting cast. While much of the pre-release publicity on this point went to the future Mrs. Tom Cruise, Katy Holmes, the real standout performances come from Michael Caine as Alfred, Wayne's stalwart Butler, Gary Oldman as the Gordon, one of Gotham's last honest cops and the city's future police commissioner, and Morgan Freeman as Lucius Fox, an inventor who helps equip Wayne for his war on crime.One thing that is a holdout from the earlier Batman films is that the movie features two villains, in this case criminal mastermind Ras Al Ghul and Scarecrow. But where this detracted from Batman in the earlier films, it works here because Nolan keeps the story centered where it ought to be, on the Dark Knight.Granted these aren't exactly A-list Batman baddies but "28 Days Later"'s Cillian Murphy imbues Scarecrow with just enough serpentine evil to make him a major player.Hardcore Batfans will of course know that Ras Al Ghul, though not a household name, is depicted in the comics as the Caped Crusader's most dangerous adversary. As the head of centuries-old criminal empire with ties to all levels of government and organized crime, he's the Batman universe equivalent of Keyser Sose. The movie gets this exactly right and you're likely to be thrown by a nifty twist involving this character.If there's one complaint about this movie it's that it's perhaps too long. But this is perhaps expected given that movie not only introduces Bruce Wayne/Batman, his entire supporting cast, two villains, and lays out a plot to destroy Gotham by driving its citizens mad.Still this movie is a treat and stands along with Sam Raimi's Spiderman films as the new benchmark by which all superhero films will be measured.So now that DC is shown that they can get Batman right on film and is getting ready roll out a new Superman next year, how about they drop the Caped Crusader and Man of Steel fixations and greenlight movies based on some of their other cool characters.A Flash movie would be awesome if done right and, speaking of "greenlighting" where's that long-discussed Green Lantern flick.Come on DC! Marvel seems to be prepping movies for just about every single one of its characters, including the C and D list ones. Get on the ball!Here's my last suggestion in four words: "Jim Carrey Is Plasticman!"

review/text: Written in an amateurish, stream of consciousness style, RANSOM reads like an author's first attempt at a novel. The omniscient point of view, deployed arbitrarily, prohibits any sort of conflict or sense of immediacy. Pages and pages of inane dialogue also fail to create intrigue, plot development or chemistry between two-dimensional characters. And we've met these nice, uninteresting people before (although Ms. Garwood &quot;tells not shows&quot; how arrogant, stubborn, brave, gorgeous etc. they all are.) Scores of needless, faceless characters are given names, a smokescreen for the lack of plot.The series of non-events, which fill three-fourths of this overlong book, creep toward a unsatisfying climax, though by the end the reader has forgotten where the story was heading and ceases to care.Try an active voice, Ms. Garwood. Give the heroine something to do besides be pretty, stubborn, and handle flesh wounds well. And more descriptions of settings and descriptions sprinkled throughout might have helped; often the voices spoke from a void.Nothing is more wonderful than a historical romance where the hero and heroine conquer insurmountable odds to be together in love and a happy ending.Unfortunately in RANSOM, neither the characters nor story was up to it.

I have had hands free on my previous car phones and it is the &quot;way to go&quot;. The kit is very inclusive and easy to install if you are comfortable with basic electronics and able to take the molding, etc, off your car in order to run the antenna coax, etc. (External antenna is not included but you really need to get one for maximum performance) Anyone who has installed a Ham or CB radio will be right at home. The mounting of the holder for the StarTAC cell phone itself may need some modification or you may want to make a bracket in order to get a neat installation.I would suggest that you mount it as high as possible in order to keep it as close to your driving line of sight for safety concerns. Mine worked flawlessly after a 2-3 hour install in a Ford F-150. Will be mounting one in our Lincoln TC soon. Also suggest that you mount the hands free microphone near the center of the car (near the rear view mirror or center it on the dash) so that a passenger can be heard should they speak. A must have.

Two hundred years later, Victor Frankenstein's original creation, now known as Deucalion, is a mysterious facially-tatooed Tibetan recluse who returns home once he learns that Victor is still alive, well & creating.In the intervening years Victor has managed to create a number of creatures to inhabit his new world order. Among them include:+ A godless, Igor-like priest (without the deformity)+ An autistic soul looking for happiness; called Randal Six+ A severed head (named Karloff) and an Adams Family-like disembodied hand+ A homicidal police detective, how ironic+ Several Stepford Wife-like brides called Erika who are numbered like movie sequels+ And a monstrous, troll-like creature who emerges from Jonathan Harker's torso in a manner reminiscent of the movie Alien. Ummm, wasn't there a Jonathan Harker in Bram Stoker's Dracula?Other monsters included:+ The horror of abuse & neglect+ The hollowness & anxiety of autism+ The despair of soul-less existence+ The terror of being violently used, stalked, maimed & killed+ The madness of unbridled ego & self-gratification+ The futile quests for soul-less faith, hope & happiness+ The guilt of righting wrongs, erasing the past & erasing the present+ The desire to create a Hitler-like world ruled/inhabited by superior beingsStill reflecting, I'm wondering whether this was intended as a tribute to the horror greats & cult movie/TV favorites or an ernest attempt to stand on Mary Shelly's shoulders to create something entirely new, yet entirely old.By the way, nice homage to Boris Karloff & The Brain that Wouldn't Die.[...]

review/text: "Rebus Set 3," as seen on BBC America, is newly-released. It was made by Britain's Independent Television (ITV), although it's being seen on the BBC channel on these shores. Like the others in this superb series, it's a police procedural excellently filmed in Edinburgh, though not the bits of it with which tourists are familiar. Furthermore, scenes, whether on the streets or in the police station, are crowded with people and cars, of correct-looking vintage, rushing around. The people have also apparently been encouraged to speak in the local dialect, which adds immeasurably to the engrossing "foreign" flavor of these productions; although the dialog might be impenetrable to those of us on these shores without the unadvertised subtitles thoughtfully provided by Acorn. The series is, of course, based on the Inspector Rebus novels, also set in Edinburgh, written by prize-winning, best selling Scottish author Ian Rankin. He's tipped by such of his colleagues as best-selling American crime novelist James Ellroy, as the progenitor and #1 practitioner of "tartan noir,"the Scottish adaptation of noir fiction: bloodier and more bloody-minded than the usual, boasting that scorching Scottish humor.This series features four more taut offerings from the hit British series of crime thrillers, including "Resurrection Men," based on the Edgar-Award for Best Novel-winning book of the same name; and "The Naming of the Dead," based on the book of the same name that won the British Book Award for Crime Thriller of the Year. Also"Knots and Crosses," based on an earlier book, the first Rebus novel, published in 1987 to great critical acclaim. And "The First Stone," apparently an original screenplay using Rankin's characters.These characters continue to be played by the excellent cast assembled for post-John Hannah productions: admired television actor Ken Stott, man of a thousand faces, in the title role, that of Detective Inspector Rebus. Claire Price as his earnest, ambitious partner Detective Sergeant Siobhan Clarke. And Jennifer Black as Detective Chief Superintendent Gillian Templer, Rebus's boss, and one of his many former lovers. Black's character appears to have beefed-up parts in this series -- and good for her -- though it looks to me as if she and Price are having trouble with the wardrobe department: the ones they've been given are dowdy, and quite meager. It's a good thing they're not making "Sex and the City.""Resurrection Men" has been just about totally rewritten from the book; that's probably just as well; as many people complained the latter was confusing. "The First Stone," an original script, is a riveting, gutsy attack on the Church of Scotland. "The Naming of the Dead" has also been largely rewritten from the book; also, undoubtedly, just as well, as many readers complained about that book,too. Finally," Knots and Crosses" is excellently done. It features actor Nicholas Farrell, who's virtually grown-up on TV and movie screens before us, as its villain.In "The First Stone," when Templer is asked how she sleeps at night, with the things she's been forced to see as a cop, she answers, "a wee dram." If you're watching this exciting series at night, you just might need similar help.

review/text: Rob Walker's LETTERS FROM NEW ORLEANS is part travelogue, part memoir with a little social commentary thrown in for good measure. According to the introduction, this book grew out of actual letters he began writing to friends after he and a girl friend identified only as "E" moved to New Orleans in early 2000. Four years later the couple left the city "for reasons that remain unclear." Since they at first were not meant for publication, perhaps that is why these meandering letters are so wondrously conversational and totally unself-conscious. To a letter, they are a delight to read and made me want to revisit this most European of U. S. cities.Mr. Walker covers some of the subjects usuallly associated with New Orleans: Mardi Gras, jazz funerals, fine dining, the French Quarter and the relentless humidity. Although he obviously loves this city, he does not shy away from writing about the blight of public housing, urban decay and the fragile balance of race relations. The book is chock-full of both memorable characters and places. Whether they got that way on their own or were made that way by Mr. Walker's pen, it really doesn't matter. We meet Ernie K-Doe, the R & B singer who gave us the hit "Mother-in-Law," whose funeral Walker writes about. And Galatorie's, the restaurant that fired a popular waiter-- who apparently couldn't keep his hands off women diners-- and so incensed its clientele that the article covering the firing in THE TIMES-PICAYUNE generated more reader comments than any subject since September 11. Don't forget the part-time embalmer at the funeral home Over by Rhodes and fulltime cashier at the grocery store Save-A Center. Or the notorious Gennifer Flowers. I feel better knowing she wound up in a club in the French Quarter where she now occasionally holds court, sings a little and will be photographed with you for $6.00. It seems appropriate that her now club once was a bar with what the writer describes as a "high-end whorehouse" upstairs.The author is nothing is not thorough. In one of the longest chapters in his book, he tells us everything we ever wanted to know-- and then some-- about the song "St. James Infirmary." Although I had never heard of the song before, I'm going to find the Harry Connick version and see what the fuss is all about. Mr. Walker is that good at making his case for this music.One of the most intriguing things about the LETTERS is that Mr. Walker never tells the name of the woman who is living with him although he mentions her constantly. She is simply "E." Elvira, Emily, Evangeline? We do not have a clue as to what the "E" stands for. Since he tells us that she left a good job in New York City to move to New Orleans with him, we are probably safe in assuming that he is not guilty of transporting a minor across state lines. On the other hand, perhaps, as Garrison Keillor would say, E thought she could do better and insisted on remaining anonymous.Finally, although there are many interesting photographs scattered throughout the book, we never see a picture of the author. Most readers want to see what a writer they like looks like-- and like Mr. Walker you will. LETTERS FROM NEW ORLEANS is a fascinating, informative read.

review/text: I first read this book maybe 20 years ago, when I was more accustomed to 'action' sci-fi replete with ray guns and space ships and trying to guess how such technology shaped society (a la Larry Niven, to name one). This book is more like an historical novel, or a future history, like reading Gibbons or Kennedy. What is particularly astounding about this work, which he first published in 1951 at age 31, is Asimov's ability to scale- from the drama of a handful of individuals to the seminal events of the last decades of the ancient, galaxy-wide empire (which does not even remember its Earthly origin!). Unlike Heinlein's _Citizen of the Galaxy_ or _Friday_ (or many others) we do not follow the story of a single person or family in the backdrop of a civilization, but rather, the original Foundation trilogy makes both the individuals as well as the whole history of the galactic empire come alive in an extremely concise work. Here, the context is just as important as the characters, a scaling rarely seen elsewhere. This is the book's greatest strength- which becomes one of its weaknesses: To be sure, and Asimov himself admitted as much about sci-fi in general, the characterizations are not terribly deep. Much time, he has written elsewhere, is required to build the context of the worlds that sci-fi writers create, with little time left to build characters to any depth. But we are watching the fall of worlds, so the relatively shallow characters may be overlooked.A must read among the classics of sci-fi.

review/text: Flat out, I bought this record because I heard &quot;Train, Train&quot; on an NPR Bluegrass show and literally had to pull over to the side of the road and listen to Sam Bush's mandolin playing. To my ears, he virtually reinvents the instrument, or at the very least brings it into the 21st century. The range of emotion he conveys through his virtuoso playing is incredible. He probably has the greatest technical mastery of the instrument of any player today. It turned out that this song, and indeed the playing in general, is just icing on a very wonderful cake. Dolly is here, in full-throated glory, belting originals, contemporaries and ancients as if they just always belonged together. Free from comercial concerns, Dolly returns to the roots of her craft and comes away with an album that is at once a brilliant showcase for her stunning range and expressiveness and a truly groundbreaking bluegrass album.

review/text: Asimov's entire line of work, and namely the 'Foundation' novels, have long been considered by some to be the gold-standard of science fiction. As an avid reader of the genre, I felt implied to give the series a whirl, to see what all the fuss is about and to finally spend some time with one of the grand-daddies of the golden age. So I bought 'Foundation', along with the other two novels in the original trilogy, and away I went.Very boring. Very dry. Very forgettable. The problem here, I think, is that while Asimov had some very fantastic ideas floating around in that pioneering noggin of his, he was not exactly the best at nurturing them into full-form on the page. Thus, we have a series of novels that read much more like outlines of a stronger and more fleshed-out epic. The setting is grand, the characters are intriguing. The plot is one for the ages. The final product, however, does little justice to these ideas and I found that to be vastly disappointing. All throughout, I wanted more. I wanted more world-building - not necessarily technobabble and meandering Dickenson discription, but at least more insight into the nature of this vast civilization apparently on the brink of collapse. Very much the same with the characters - I wanted to sympathize with Hari Seldon as he worked to keep knowledge alive in the face of ignorance, but it was so hard to do so when he was presented as little more than a piece of animated cardboard. I was thinking constantly about what could have been, and that put a damper on the overall effect.I think the ideas and character tropes Asimov put forth in his trilogy have been worked with by other authors and brought to life far more successfully in the years since its initial release. Novels that come to mind are Dan Simmons's awe-inspiring 'Hyperion' series and Neal Stephenson's bulky 'Anathem'. In these books, great ideas are coupled with great writing. The results, as much as it hurts me to say it, put Asimov's original to shame.'Foundation' is a great series to read if you want to witness science fiction as it was in its infantile and supposedly-golden age. But I think that it#s nevertheless important to understand that pioneering ideas can further develop and be presented in far-superior ways as the years progress. Such is the case here. Imaginative, but slow and dated. Should most certainly remain in print and continue to be read, but I do not think it is the gold-standard classic it has been made out to be. Others have done much better.

review/text: Okay. You have two movies here that many critics and customers want to compare. We have the original &quot;The Haunting,&quot; impeccably filmed in 1963 in black and white by the talented director Robert Wise. The stars were Julie Harris, Claire Bloom, Richard Johnson and Russ Tamblyn. One cannot help but admit that this version is superior to the remake on a psychological level. Also you can't do better than Ms. Harris or Ms. Bloom. It was a frightening movie and one I remember from my childhood days.Now, on the other hand, here in the 21st Century, we have Jan DeBont's remake of &quot;The Haunting.&quot; Would people have wanted DeBont to do what they did with the remake of &quot;Psycho?&quot; Filmed it exactly? We know how &quot;Psycho&quot; fared, don't we? Anyway, I found the special effects, scenic design, and sound effects mind-boggling and fun. Sure, we see MORE in this film, but is that wrong? If you don't compare the remake to the original, you may have a better time. I was disappointed in Liam Neeson's lifeless performance, and Lili Taylor is no Julie Harris. Owen Wilson was rather annoying in his role, but Catherine Zeta-Jones was the surprise star. Sure, they updated her and made her look like a tart. But what a tasty tart. And along with her incredible beauty, she brings a lot of life and vitality to the spooky surroundings. And weren't Bruce Dern and Marian Seldes a hoot as the creepy caretakers?So, the plot is much different than original, and the ending lacks the psychological/emotional impact of the 1963 version. But I had a good time throughout the movie, and don't think it's fair to compare such different movies. Apples and oranges. But, if you have an open mind a good bowl of popcorn, I think you'll have fun.

review/text: I tracked down a copy of this movie solely because of J&uuml;rgen Prochnow's presence in it. It's getting some wider distribution lately due to the fact that it's also one of Elizabeth Hurley's earliest movies.This is a fun movie if you like Prochnow, Hurley, or sailing, because most of the movie is set on a beautiful 45-foot (approximate) ocean-going sailboat out in the middle of the Atlantic.Also released under two other titles: Der Skipper (The Skipper) and The Storm. Filmed in English, but the looping is so bad in places that it looks dubbed.Basic plot: Prochnow's best friend (and his wife's lover) drowns at sea during a storm while they two of them are out on a fishing trip. The wife blames Prochnow for her lover's death and leaves him. Prochnow spends the next six months in a drunken haze in Gibraltar, each day saying he's putting out to sea &quot;tomorrow; what's the use in staying here?&quot; Then he meets two young British women (Hurley and Patsy Kensit) who want to go to Barbados. He agrees to take them.Neither woman knows anything about sailing and they refuse to learn, so Prochnow has to do all the work (fortunately, it's a boat that can reasonably be handled by one person). Kensit's character displays a great deal of neurotic-bordering-on-psychotic behavior, and both try, at different times, to seduce the Skipper. Alas, cabin fever also sets in, leading to more neurotic/psychotic behavior.Well-acted by Prochnow (of course), but a bit uneven with Hurley and Kensit. Budget must have run out, because the final scene comes out of nowhere and makes very little sense.

review/text: Philbrick's book reads a lot like Sebastian Junger's &quot;The Perfect Storm.&quot; Like Junger, he details life in a fishing community and documents a seafaring trajedy that shook the town. Similar to Junger's description of drowning, Philbrick provides a graphic description of death by dehydration to emphasize what the fishermen were experiencing as they drifted for three months in open whaleboats on the vast Pacific Ocean. The main difference between Philbrick's account and Jungers is that some of Philbrick's fisherman lived to tell the tale. Philbrick is an excellent storyteller who brings his subject alive. Anyone with an interest in either the sea or a good adventure story will love this book.

review/text: I've read a bit about Anne Boleyn and the rest of Henry VIII's court and many wives, so I was intrigued by this book in spite of the flashy movie tie-in cover. Like most, I had no previous knowledge of Mary Boleyn's life. The factual evidence that Mary was Henry's mistress for 2-3 years, together with the timing of the births of her first two children would certainly give great credence to the theory that they were Henry's children, as well as the many honors which were granted to her family during that time. It would also seem very unlikely that Henry would have tolerated Mary bedding both him and her husband during the years of Henry's favor.Regardless of the accuracy of Ms Gregory's narratives relating to the maneuvers of her father and uncle in getting her into Henry's bed, or what Mary may or may not have thought about the role of women in her era, I think the author is owed a few bows for bringing this bit of history to wider audiences than serious Tudor scholars. Certainly the 4 or 5 biographies of this era that are in my personal library scarcely mention Mary at all. Ms Gregory has written an interesting and very readable tale, one that kept me turning the pages.

review/text: This German film directed by Hermine Huntgeburth is like a comic spin on The Grifters but with an added sexual component. When one of the 3 petty criminals who wallet snatch using the blind man ploy is injured in a chase, a replacement is chosen from someone who had tried to steal from them and had failed. His punishment was to be stripped by the two gay male members of the team, which prefigures the sexual triangle that eventuates when both the father and his daughter are attracted to the new member. We know that when we are told the group's rule is no exchange of body fluids that it is said to be broken. Huntgeburth gets comic mileage out of who is the the aggressor in each relationship and the stolen moments of intimacy they have in fear of being discovered by the third party. The most refreshing touch is how the father (Gotz George) is established as being mean to his gay partner, yet he becomes foolish when faced with the attentions of a younger man, as if he cannot believe it possible, and the Shakespearian appearance of George emphasises him as a classically defined pathetic figure. George actually resembles a brunette and heavy-set Ralph Fiennes. The daughter probably has the least interesting role, but Felix Eitner as the boy demonstrates the bisexual trend of modern sexuality, the free sexual preference of European men, and the question of sex as duplicitious behaviour. When Eitner's pet snake is disposed of cruelly, Huntgeburth sets up an expectation for his own fate, with the snake as metaphor. The accordian music of Niki Reiser sets the tone with it's melancholy and suggestion of exotic mischief, and thankfully Huntgeburth's treatment lacks the concluding cruelty of the Stephen Frears title.

I would strongly suggest this to any Zelda fan, or Zelda music fan, or even any music fan at all! Here are some brief descriptions for you to see what some of the songs are like:Title Theme: The song at the beginning of the game, slow but very peacefull.Boss Battle: Wow, this one has you feeling the power of the boss you are facing, or has you feel like you are facing one! :)Zelda's Theme: I like this one quite a bit, also slow and peacefull.Goron City: This one is pretty good until a yelping noise joins in the song...Lost Woods: Fast and entergettic (sorry if I spelled that wrong), I never grow tired of this one.Temple of Time: I can't hear any insterments in this one, only eccoy voices. Has you feel like you are in an oversized cathedral.Windmill Hut: I call this song the Song of Storms, but you can find it in the Windmill hut. Pretty much feels like a rain storm!Nocturne of Shadow: Ok, I like this one alot, I mean a whole LOT!Gives you a creepy feeling, gotta love that! :)Last Battle: This one really fits perfectly as, the title says, the Last Battle. Feels powerful.End Credits: This is by far the longest track on the cd, running a little past 7 minutes. Great for credits, hey its great for anything! But it does seem like they stringed together some of the other song to make it... No big deal, still great.I hope this has helped you in your journey in buying this cd! I also give great thanks to Koji Kondo for making all this great music for the Zelda games. Bravo.

review/text: C.S. Lewis' Mere Christianity is a great work about faith. Many intellectuals may scoff in contempt about some of the logic that Lewis uses, but in some ways that is the entire point of this book. He gives a concise and easily understandable description of what faith means. Keep in mind that this book is comprised of essays, many of which were born out of a radio program during World War 2.While Mere Christianity is a great read it should not be taken as the gospel truth. C.S. Lewis was a brilliant individual, but some of his beliefs about women in a religious perspective are outdated. He would be the first to tell you that he was nothing more than a layman when it comes to explaining the Kingdom of God. Qualms aside, this is a really great book and it is easy to read. Those that like Mere Christianity should read Lewis' The Screwtape Letters.

review/text: This is an excellent recording and fine tribute from the pianist to his teacher Nadia Boulanger.A few words to one of the reviewers for his questionable comments about the works of the two women composers on this album. First of all, Nadia Boulanger herself admitted that she was not a composer, but a teacher. Lili Boulanger was not a teacher but in the span of her short life of 24 years she left a small body of work of remarkable quality and inspiration very much earmarked with genius. We can only speculate on what she might have further achieved had she lived. Igor Stravinsky was 28 when he composed The Firebird and 31 when the Rite of Spring was first performed. Arnold Schoenberg was 38 when he wrote Pierrot. To compare Boulanger who was born ten years after Stravinsky who himself outlived her by over fifty years of creative life or Arnold Schoenberg who was almost twenty years her senior is a bit unfair. Furthermore composers Aaron Copland, Roy Harris and Virgil Thomson also lived into creative old age. Personal responses or opinions about a composer or artist are the right of all, but a review should be put into perspective.

review/text: I spent the first 13 years of my life as a career woman and then we decided to start our family. It was very important to me to have one of us there to raise our own children (not daycare) so we waited until we had purchased our first house and we found that my husband's job was sufficient to cover our needs. This meant that we got a little later start than most and we had a few less toys than some, but it was worth it to both of us! 30 years later, I lost my husband and had to make some hard decisions again, as I still have two young children at home. After allot of research and creative thinking, I opted to turn a hobby of mine into a job that I could do from home. It isn't easy, I don't draw a huge income, but it makes ends meet and I can give the same TLC and attention that I gave to my older children to my younger two.I agree strongly with the author, if you have children, then you need to fit the career to the children, not the other way around. Children deserve our best, not our leftovers at the end of the day, after all, they are not an accessory and they need and want our focus. I enjoy my children and my career, though after losing my husband, I was told that the only option that I had was working full time. I am sorry, but those nay sayers don't give women enough credit! How sad that so many leave their young children for other's to raise, simply because they don't believe that staying and/or working at home is an option!

review/text: This book takes the story of the Larne, Sheramy and UpJohn families through the civil war and it's aftermath. The author provides a very realistic portrayal of the upper class Larnes and Sheramys and the poor UpJohns, the latter having to struggle for work as the upper class had the slave labor to do most of the work for "free". Also, the turnaround of the cultures in the aftermath of the civil war, the Larnes and Sheramys having to struggle to survive and keep their plantations while Corrie May was able to catch a coattail of a carpet bagger and his money.I have to say that "A Reader" in September 2002 summed this book up better than I could. Well worth the time to find this out of print book, I was able to get a copy from my local library. Please note, that the comment by "A Reader" in 1999 who called it smutty must be thinking about another book. This was as chaste as a book could be, and would be a good choice for a younger reader.

review/text: You can judge a film by the company it keeps, and amazon's always spot-on recommending technology tells me that fans of 'Nowhere in Africa' are also interested in the following current releases: Hotel Rwanda; A Very Long Engagement; Bad Education; and Million Dollar Baby. Since I've seen and am enthusiatic about each of those, I'd like to suggest that fans of any of those films check out 'Nowhere in Africa,' which is richly deserving of its 2002 Academy Award for best foreign language film.Pay no attention to other critiques on this page about needing to understand German, or about not being able to understand the subtleties of the dialogue because it's not in English. That's hogwash. The subtitles here are excellent, as is the acting, most notably by Juliane K&ouml;hler and Merab Ninidze as lead protagonists Jettel and Walter Redlich. These are great actors who skillfully portray every nuance of their actions and feelings in a way that transcends any language barrier.My only complaint is that director Caroline Link could have been a bit more judcious about the editing process. At 2 hours 21 minutes, the film feels about 15 minutes too long and drags at stretches. That's a small quibble in the face of the overall quality of this production.

review/text: Serious film lovers are surely blessed that Facets Video (which brought out top rated 'Decalogue' and recently Bela Tarr's 'Satantango') has now released a totally pristine DVD of this almost forgotten 1970's U.K. filmmaker.Here is Douglas' own poverty stricken childhood in a small Scottish village, recreated using mainly non-professional actors in three one hour segments. According to the added special feature documentary, Douglas (who died in 1991 of lung cancer) escaped the brutality of his surroundings by virtually living in his town's dumpy movie theater. If this brings to mind Antoine Doinel in Truffaut's 'The 400 Blows,' that's fine, but replace Antoine's Paris with a landscape straight from Samuel Beckett.Douglas' genius was very much appreciated at the time but the producers also knew he had little commercial appeal. He was only to make one commercial film ("Comrades") before his death.He was very much enamoured of silent movies and in this trilogy, dialog is very limited. Instead, his camera lingers long enough on a face or an abandoned yard or a shabby table, so that words become superfluous.This is a great film experience. Several days after seeing it for the first time, the images still replay themselves in my mind. Once you own it, you'll know exactly what to buy next for your dedicated film buff friends.

review/text: "The Mayor of Casterbridge" ought to be the model of what a classic is not. Books deemed as a "classic" are said to be everlasting and universal in its message. This book does not spread its wings into our era, and it does not apply to everyone in some way, unless you've experienced paternity uncertainty and emotional neglect. The characters are rigid, changing without reason, and lacking practical emotions. Michael Henchard is repulsive from the start, from when he sells his wife and child, to his emotional withdrawal towards the young woman who turned out to be his non-biological daughter, to hiding the truth of who her father actually was to Elizabeth-Jane, so one cannot pity his outcome. Elizabeth-Jane, the non-biological daughter of Henchard, was completely void of personality. "Blas&eacute;" has more personality than Elizabeth-Jane. After a tennis match type life, of being flung back and forth between fathers, to marrying Donald Farfrae who one day courted her, married another woman (who just happened to be the landlord of the house Elizabeth-Jane was living at, at the time), and then realized his affection for her, Elizabeth-Jane would've been a prime candidate for therapy (how could she give her heart to men who kept being introduced as her father?), but instead acted as if she was a spokesperson normalcy. Finally, Donald Farfrae, a Scotsman, who was the poster boy for blandness, never really showed growth. He was always monotone, and I could not tell if he found Elizabeth-Jane's biological father to scorn Henchard, or truly help Elizabeth-Jane find the truth. I felt naught for the characters but purposelessness, and the story itself was uncreative and improbable. I do no recommend.

That medley is just as unified as &quot;The Water&quot; on an earlier album, and it runs over 20 minutes like that one. I guess they just didn't give it an overall title. But you do get the same progressive sound that falls somewhere between the traditional prog style as done by Marillion and the new harder-edged style of Dream Theater. These guys are a bit too good for the minor label they're on, but maybe that's not such a bad thing--major label acts often end up mainstreaming their sound. The only trouble is that not every store carries them, so not enough people know who they are. Well, there's one way to handle that. Do like I do--get this album, get their others, and drop their name all over the place. Word of mouth is how the original generation of prog got rolling, after all.

Now, concerts in blu-ray are the only live performance DVD's I buy. And when I learned that Porky Tree's "Anesthetize" was available on blu-ray, I couldn't wait to get my own copy. Eager with excitement, I popped the DVD in my player and was ready for greatness.THUD!!!I've got to say that I'm a bit disappointed in the quality. Especially after owning and watching Pat Metheny's "The Way Up" and Steve Vai's latest blu-ray offering. The bar has been raised and I expect more from a band like Porcupine Tree. Porcupine tree is one of the best bands around, if not the best prog band around today. The music on this DVD is outstanding. But I was hoping for more. The quality is merely okay and one must exit the performance to view the menu - a big negative, since it's common with the format.In spite of that, I'm looking forward to buying future PT releases on blu-ray and attending their live shows. Now, all you prog snobs, you can send me your hate mail beginning now :-) !

review/text: When we bemoan the awful disco of the 1970s, we forget the creatuve force of writers like Jimmy Webb. His &quot;Reunion&quot; album with Glen Campbell (in fine voice--light years from his insufferable &quot;Rhinestone Cowboy&quot; days)--features excellent imagery-laden lyrics with heart-tugging melodies and gorgeous string arrangements that never seem smarmy. &quot;Wishing Now,&quot; &quot;It Must Be a Sin,&quot; and &quot;I Keep It Hid&quot; are worth the whole price of admission. Even though some of the added material features non-Webb arrangements that pale in comparison (though Campbell meets the challenge of &quot;Highwayman&quot;), the whole thing reminds you of a time when genuine emotion still pervaded popular music. Some lovely stuff here.

review/text: I have to say this is one case where the movie is better than the book, but that bar was set pretty low. Where the book has barely a plot and nothing of any interest (unless you're a huge HGTV fan), the movie has a slightly more interesting plot by virtue of a protagonist that has just gone through a divorce. Her home has appreciated significantly (which explains better than the book how she has the wealth to buy a Tuscan villa and renovate it). Her friends then sign her onto a gay tour of Tuscany, which could have given the movie some depth ...but evidently was scuttled in favor of more conventional fare. Nothing dooms a film like cowardice.The rest of the movie is about the woman trying to find a new husband while pretending not to. In the end, of course (of course!) she succeeds. This kind of twaddle should embarrass even made-for-TV writers.In the right hands, this revised storyline could have turned into a perfectly decent movie. Unfortunately it is saccharine, utterly predictable and fails even to take advantage of Tuscany's exceptional scenery.

review/text: I have been waiting for this set to go on sale at our local Toys-R-Us for a month. We bought it yesterday and to the surprise of my husband, I was able to put it together (not the swing arm though) in 1 1/2 hours with the help of the 12 year old neighbor girls.My 17 month old daughter absolutely loves it. She was trying to play on it before it was even fully assembled. She easily climbs onto the lower platform herself and is even able to climb up the rope ladder (though she can't climb down it) It is low enough to the ground that if she would accidentally fall off she should not sustain serious injury.We love that this is a jungle gym and swingset combined and hope that it will last her until around age 5, when we plan on building a large wooden play structure.A tip though, you do need to drill THROUGH the plastic in many places, this is not explicitly mentioned in the instructions and I was hesitant to do so but it is necessary.

review/text: Eversince my dad bought this movie four years ago, I have been hooked. Hookline and sinker. It is a wonderful, emotional movie that leaves you dreading the moment that it will come to an end.Captain Ahab(Patrick Stewart)is a man that is waging a constant war with his inner demons eversince the day that his leg was bit off by his arch Nemesis Moby Dick. Believing Moby Dick to be satan in disguise, and he, Ahab, Gods own avenger against such a creature. Ahab charters a ship, whose crew must unknowinly follow Ahab on his journey through the hellish darkness of his madness.There is one man who dares to defy the utter madness of Ahab, and that is Starbuck(Ted Levine) who pleads with Ahab to forgo his passion for revenge. The Quaker in him being struck senseless by such a blasphemous outrage against God and nature.It is a mariners tale of men against nature, and forces that he cannot, and should not try and control. It is a story of how deep one man's madness can influence others. It is a tale of one's man desire to become a god, to hold the life and death of a scant few people in the palm of his hand.But his madness does not lead him to glory, or even the menial triumph of his victory. Instead, it leads him and his crew to a watery grave, Ahabs lust for revenge nothing more than a death sentance for those that needed not die. A wonderful, but sad movie nevertheless. The music also gives it depths that could probally be not achieved otherwise. Definitaly a must see.

review/text: There are certain aspects of this production that are very good, & other aspects that are not so good. Pros: the locations & scenery & color are terrific. If this is not Sherwood Forest, then it seems like it could be. The locations are realistic, castles seem period appropriate, & so do costumes, utensils, & customs. Unlike other productions, I do not hear the hollow sound of plywood while the actors are walking on stone floors or earth. This production has invented its own unique personalities for Robin's band of outlaws, as some previous productions had. Some of these work well (Marian, Sheriff, King Richard, King John), others don't work well at all (Will Scarlet, Friar Tuck), etc. The element of mysticism & paganism (especially Herne the Hunter), although not seen in a Robin Hood telling before, do seem appropriate for the time period. There is a degree of reality that is missing from most earlier versions (bad guys sometimes do get killed here, instead of just being wounded). Cons: the acting leaves much to be desired; some of the actors are quite competent but others need more work. There is entirely too much screaming; screaming does not equal emoting, & much of it rings hollow. The script-writing is sub-par; some words (particularly "idiot") are used countless times in each episode. Some of the dialog sounds out-of-time (for some reason, "What's up?," heard in two different episodes, doesn't have the ring of medieval England). The plots in the first season are too simplistic & often redundant. There needs to be more of Robin's outlaw band (even as minor players or extras); it seems like there are only eight outlaws here, not enough to be "realistic" (that is, according to the legends, some of which stated that the Merry Men numbered over 100). There is much in the way of action scenes here, but it is not well-coordinated & the stunts need improvement (part of the problem is that the actors do much of their own stunt-work, & it's evident in terms of slowness, lack of agility, & lack of reality). A sword fight & stabbing in this production usually looks like it's at the level of young boys playing make-believe, & comes off as phony. Overall, a worthwhile production which is fairly good, but could have been much better. The episodes greatly improved starting with the last show of the first season, & the notable improvement continued throughout the second season. The Robin of the first season was replaced by Robert, Earl of Huntingdon, played by a different actor. Viewer's opinions are divided on which actor is better, but what has significantly improved is the writing (dialog & plot), the action choreography, & continuity. The second season's shows are not redundant, are more interesting, & even returning actors seem to be doing a better job by not being quite as over the top as previously. For me, watching the first season's pitfalls made me enjoy the second season all the more. 3* for the first season, 4* for the second season.

review/text: The &quot;Book Description&quot; review is correct when it says that&quot;The Complete Guide to Home Masonry is the most comprehensive and useful guide to masonry for today's do-it-yourself homeowner.&quot;About the only thing missing from this one-sentence summary is that the book is nigh-exclusively devoted to OUTDOOR projects. (The short exceptions are damp-proofing basement walls, and repairing fireboxes.)The book features clear step-by-step instructions and color photographs (one good photo for each and every step of every project -- HUNDREDS of photos total) for working with natural stone, stone veneer, brick, glass block, concrete block, poured concrete, patio tile, stucco, and hypertufa.The projects cover all the simple outdoor jobs (such as walkways, walls, and patios), the common elaborations (such as adding lattice panels to a block wall, or laying tile over concrete), and quite a number of complex constructs -- like &quot;Building a Stone Moon Window&quot;.EVERY section of text has one or more illustrating photographs to show what they're writing about. EVERY photograph is in color, with good contrast, color rendition, and composition. EVERY project includes an &quot;Everything You Need&quot; box, listing all the tools and materials required. EVERY tool that's used in the projects has (1) a picture in the &quot;Masonry Tools &amp; Equipment&quot; chapter early in the book; (2) a closeup of the tool in use; and (3) explanatory text discussing proper technique. EVERY material used has pictures of all states through its life -- from the bags clearly depicting brand names like &quot;Quikrete&quot; and &quot;Lehigh&quot;, to the dry materials, the mixing process, the layout stage, and finishing with the final assembled project.If this book had the same comprehensive coverage for INDOOR projects (tiling bathrooms and creating concrete countertops are high on my wish list), it would be worth SIX stars!

review/text: One of the largest contributions of this book is its effort to combine economic history with cultural analysis. Livingston takes the time to distinguish important structural changes in the US economy during this period (1850-1940). More cultural historians and critics should grapple with this material--Livingston can wean us off of blanket labels ("incorporation," "Gilded Age") that leave no room for thinking through the more dynamic relations of the economic and the cultural.A second virtue of this book is Livingston's provocative, polemic argument. Although his political sympathies are with the left, he offers a strong critique of the tendency among left historians to see the emergence of corporate capitalism as the effective end to any chance for victory on the left. This "tragic" mode of analysis, Livingston argues, means we can only remain mired in a nostalgic orientation toward the past. Livingston turns to two cultural formations--literary naturalism (especially the fiction of Theodore Dreiser) and pragmatism (especially William James)--to argue for a "social self" that offers hope for political progress but is not inherently at odds with corporate capitalism. I'm still not sure if I buy Livingston's argument, but his frame of analysis and reflections on history and models of selfhood are tremendously fruitful.Although the book is largely an advanced academic study, it is clearly written and free of jargon. Well read students of American history and culture will be able to follow the analysis.

However, after activating the GM Enhanced Data I found out that it was still not able to display some of the enhanced data such as CAM Retard, which is what I needed to set the distributor on by GM Vehicle. The standard features worked good, fast communication between scanner and vehicle, and you can clear codes without having to shut the engine down (cheaper scanners force you to have the engine off to reset the fault codes). If SPX can get all of the enhanced data working on this scanner I would give it a 5. My best word of advice before you buy, search forums and call SPX tech support to verify the data you need is available on the scanner.

review/text: Okay. You have two movies here that many critics and customers want to compare. We have the original &quot;The Haunting,&quot; impeccably filmed in 1963 in black and white by the talented director Robert Wise. The stars were Julie Harris, Claire Bloom, Richard Johnson and Russ Tamblyn. One cannot help but admit that this version is superior to the remake on a psychological level. Also you can't do better than Ms. Harris or Ms. Bloom. It was a frightening movie and one I remember from my childhood days.Now, on the other hand, here in the 21st Century, we have Jan DeBont's remake of &quot;The Haunting.&quot; Would people have wanted DeBont to do what they did with the remake of &quot;Psycho?&quot; Filmed it exactly? We know how &quot;Psycho&quot; fared, don't we? Anyway, I found the special effects, scenic design, and sound effects mind-boggling and fun. Sure, we see MORE in this film, but is that wrong? If you don't compare the remake to the original, you may have a better time. I was disappointed in Liam Neeson's lifeless performance, and Lili Taylor is no Julie Harris. Owen Wilson was rather annoying in his role, but Catherine Zeta-Jones was the surprise star. Sure, they updated her and made her look like a tart. But what a tasty tart. And along with her incredible beauty, she brings a lot of life and vitality to the spooky surroundings. And weren't Bruce Dern and Marian Seldes a hoot as the creepy caretakers?So, the plot is much different than original, and the ending lacks the psychological/emotional impact of the 1963 version. But I had a good time throughout the movie, and don't think it's fair to compare such different movies. Apples and oranges. But, if you have an open mind a good bowl of popcorn, I think you'll have fun.

review/text: The Third Secret follows the typical suspense/thriller model. It is adequately interesting to keep one reading. The early pages filled with interesting bits of information about the Vatican's history. However, (And I won't give away the secret) at about page 350, the book takes a dive. Steve Berry apparently thinks that no one will object when he shoves in his personal views on divisive church issues. But whether you agree with him or not, the revelation is completely unwarranted. I suppose Berry was trying to set his religious thriller in the same vein as Dan Brown's "heretical" books. In the end the book devolves into a treastise of Berry's personal views, presented in a way that debate is impossible. That added to the absolutely deplorable behavior by the story's protagonists (which Berry makes no attempt to challenge) makes this book a disappointing read at best.

Was thinking about buying a Kindle. After looking at the Kindle prices of most books still covered by copyright, though, I definitely will not. I can buy the REAL book for about the same price brand-new in most cases, and substantially cheaper if I buy a used copy. Besides a truly backward price, with a Kindle version I'd also lose the ability to do any of the following: lend out my books anytime I want to anybody I choose, donate them to libraries or secondhand stores, or trade them in for credit towards other books at a used bookstore. Net result: current ebooks = epic FAIL on value.

review/text: Beat Takeshi provides another violent movie, whose purpose seems to be that violence begets violence, and ultimately it's a dead end. The basic plot has Takeshi playing a yakuza forced to leave Japan upon the death of his boss. He finds his half brother in LA pushing drugs rather than attending school. Takeshi violently turns the small time crew into a major crime cartel.Yakuza themes of loyalty to family and honor over life pervade the movie. The omnipresent violence somehow avoids being gratuitous, perhaps because one realizes how more graphic it could have been. Unlike traditional western shoot 'em ups, we are left with the aftermath instead of the fight scenes themselves. At times it is hard to follow the plot and remember who is on whose sides, but perhaps that is the point.

review/text: Franco Zefferelli (who made his directorial debut with "The Taming Of The Shrew" and would go on to direct "Jesus Of Nazareth", a mammoth six hour TV miniseries and "Hamlet" starring Mel Gibson, director, producer and co-screenwriter of "The Passion Of The Christ") does an excellent job directing "Romeo And Juliet." This version (and "West Side Story", which is the closest to modern as you should get to Shakespeare) is better than the sh---- modern one directed by Baz Luhrman and starring Leonardo DiCaprio ("TITANIC", a movie which could've been better, but that's another story) and Claire Danes ("Little Women," "Terminator 3: Rise Of The Machines," etc.) Take my word for it, Leonard Whiting and the lovely Olivia Hussey are very believable as the doomed lovers in 15th century Verona, not only given their ages, which made them entirely suitable for the role, but also their acting in this movie. Michael York (who made his acting debut in Zefferell's "The Taming Of The Shrew") plays Tybalt, exuding pure malice, though John Leguizamo didn't do such a bad job, but THAT version was "Fart." 'Twas that bad. Sir Laurence Olivier, considered the greatest Shakespearean actor of his day (watch his 1948 Oscar-winning version of "Hamlet" and you'll know why I agree 100% with that), has an uncredited role as the offscreen Narrator. This version is well-done. Should've won Best Picture. My favorite part is when Juliet says, "It is, it is, high hence begone; away." Olivia Hussey has a great body in this film. Rated PG for brief nudity.

But overall, this film is excellently presented. I don't have any complaints about the sound or the picture- in fact, I thought it was remarkably clear considering that it hasn't been preserved as well as a lot of other pictures. Trust me, the plot more than makes up for any minor annoyances.In an Oscar nominated performance, Joan Crawford plays successful playwright Myra Hudson. When she falls in love with a handsome actor named Lester (played by Jack Palance, nominated for Best Supporting Actor) everything seems perfect. But when she discovers her husband's plot to murder her, she designs a plan to reverse the gun.This movie is great, and if you're not one of those people who whine when they don't get all the bells and whistles, you'll love it too.

review/text: The tale of The Hound of the Baskervilles has such sturdy bones that it's probably the most filmed of the Great Detective's cases. Let's see...I've watched at one time or another Richard Roxburgh, Peter Cushing, Basil Rathbone, Jeremy Brett, Peter Cook, Matt Frewer and Ian Richardson play Holmes as he pursues the solution to this monstrous plot. One or two I've enjoyed less than the others. One was really grim; an attempt at comedy that had many things but humor, unless you find uproarious a chihuahua with the bladder the size of a bull mastiff's urinating on a person's foot.With this version, Ian Richardson plays Holmes, Donald Churchill plays Watson, Martin Shaw plays Sir Henry Baskerville and Denholm Elliot plays Dr. Mortimer. Grimpen Mire continues to play Grimpen Mire, and that dark, fog-swept Dartmoor bog is not a place you'd want to venture into, even if a slavering hound weren't bounding after you.Just to restate the plot: Sherlock Holmes and his friend Dr. John Watson are visited in their rooms at 221B Baker street by Dr. Mortimer. Mortimer tells Holmes the story of the Baskervilles and the curse that was laid upon them. Mortimer's best friend, Sir Charles Baskerville, has died under suspicious circumstances. Now the heir, Henry Baskerville, is arriving from Canada. Mortimer believes Sir Henry is at risk and pleads for Holmes to intervene. Holmes says he cannot leave London for a few days, but agrees to meet Sir Henry. Homes then agrees there are unusual aspects to the case and has Watson accompany Sir Henry to Baskerville Hall. Watson is to report back by mail until Holmes can arrive. And now we enter the world of swirling fog, of nights without moonlight, of swamps that can suck an unwary man under, of servants who seem too silent, and of neighbors...a brother and sister who live near by. Then there is the unnerving howling of a great beast to be heard late at night.Richardson gives us a Holmes who smiles a little more than we're used to. He's just as analytic and perceptive, but seems more understanding of human foibles that, say, Rathbone's or Brett's versions. Because the story is so inherently dramatic, however, as long as the actors are accomplished the issue of who's a better Holmes isn't all that important. It's not a zero-sum game, where if you prefer Rathbone, for instance, then automatically Brett must be diminished. While I might prefer one over the other, I think Richardson, Brett, Rathbone and Cushing all give satisfying performances and I enjoy each of them.This version, like the others, has first-rate production values and solid acting. The one thing that bothers me is that Donald Churchill as Watson comes perilously close to the Nigel Bruce School of Acting. Churchill doesn't make Watson the elderly buffoon that Bruce turned Watson into, but he makes Watson far more obtuse than necessary to help the story.Since there was a rapacious Baskerville ancestor, since there were suspicious deaths, since there was a great hound, and since there was an unscrupulous murderer, I don't think I'm giving anything away by quoting Dr. Watson's last line in the movie. "The curse of the Baskervilles," he says to Holmes, with a shake of his head, "...a figment of the imagination." Or Holmes' last line. "Without the imagination," he says with a smile to Watson, "there would be no horror."The DVD looks fine. There are no extras.

review/text: Mr. Mamdani's book is a good read all through. His thesis is novel, arguments sound and conclusion is unbiased. His analysis of America's cold war policy of transition from containment to rollback is an eye-opener. Specially noteworthy is his observation of how covert operations undertaken during Reagan era in order to bypass obtaining funds from tax-payers' money through rampant act of aiding and abetting drug trafficking changed to Bush's approach of privatizing military with similar goal of keeping American people in dark regarding its imperial policy in Iraq and elsewhere. Also, his arguments showing parallel mind sets of imperial Europe and modern America regarding the practice of democratic despotism is laudable. European historians always argued in favor of colonizing &quot;lower&quot; races with the `sacred' interest to civilise and enlighten them, the so called &quot;White men's burden&quot; (Rudyard Kippling) and that mass slaughter (genocide), mass starvation and plundering natural wealth and enslavement to feed industrial revolution in their home countries are but the `collateral' damages. Similar `collateral' damages inflicted on the Third world countries in the name of containment during cold war and globalisation following that era by America bears all the diagnostic features of imperial Europe. Finally, I share his frustration when he concludes by saying that whereas serious efforts are being made by the world at large to restrain the terrorism of Muslim origin, an absolute lack of similar efforts to check American and Israeli fundamentalism (the Judeo-Christian terrorism) gives a helpless feeling.

review/text: Jack Polidoro grabs the readers attention from the start. He puts the reader right into the lives of the people who are the players in this book. He begins by telling just enough to whet one's appetite making the reader hungry for more of the story. His eye for detail is amazing, one would have to believe that the author himself is a pilot and has been through a crash landing in open water. Once the serious actions began to take place, I found myself riveted to the book to the degree that I could not put it down until I had completed it. Polidoro manages to come up with an unexpected domino affect as a result of the first tragedy to take place. He has just enough twists and turns in his novel to peak the interest of any reader. Had I not read the nature of the plot, I might have been hesitant to take another flight on a commercial airline. This is one book that has it all, suspense, romance, intrigue, and fast action. I would recommend it as a great read for everyone.

review/text: Dierks is OK, decent even, but he's not progressing enough...it's more of the same. This is fine with many artists, but Dierks is not ALTERNATIVE enough, if at all. He's tried to play both sides of the fence on his last 2 records...mainstream and alt-country, and it's getting old. Be one or the other, and it seems he's leaning more on the mainstream side on this new album, which I don't like. I HATE mainstream country, there's no edge, no real ROCK & ROLL in it, and it's tailormade for radio, and I can't stand mainstream country radio. On this record, it seems the label is trying to mold Dierks into being all mainstream. No way man, he blew it this time. He doesn't have enough of an inner hunger or independent streak. If anything, one new country record out this week that blows this one away is Vince Gill's new 4CD extravaganza of 43 NEW SONGS!!! Each disc focuses on a distinct style: catchy rock, southern soul/blues, traditional country, and acoustic/bluegrass. Vince wrote or co-wrote all the songs, plays lead guitar on all of them, co-produced it all, and he doesn't give a damn about having a hit single, ie it's not COMMERCIAL, and he's true to his art and his strengths, which is more important and makes Vince kind of alternative...Dierks should follow this path and defy what his label wants...independent alternative artistry is more important than hit singles, which are actually detrimental to any career, as they put artists into a box. Dierks CAN break the mold and escape this mentality, while there's still time...we'll see...nice packaging on the limited edition though...

review/text: George Milton, a little man physically, tried to receive a harvesting job along with his close friend Lennie, who on the other hand, is a giant of a man physically, but very slow mentally. George acted like Lennie's older brother and watched out for him. Their boss stated, "Well, I never seen one guy take so much trouble for another guy. I just like to know what your interest is" (25). "Lennie kills without malice-- animals and people die simply because of his strength. Lennie himself must die simply because within the society of man he is an anomaly and weak." The theme of the book is universal," a friendship and a shared dream that makes an individual's existence meaningful." The great, classical novel will remain well read, and a well-liked book for ages to come. The book Of Mice and Men by John Steinbeck is an attempt to reveal "commitment, loneliness, hope, and loss remains," along with the labor forces in the late 1930's. Reader can easily relate to the characters and setting in the novel and, as a result, the book has influenced many readers. The book had great significance on the readers during the time in which the book was written. The style of writing is very simplistic, easy to understand, and very entertaining. " Part of Steinbeck's greatness lies in his ability to capture this tone of basic reality." Steinbecks'style of simplicity and easy reading in Of Mice and Men captures the reader's interest right from the get go, and along with the easy relating themes and plot keeps the readers attention until the last words are read. "John Steinbeck is famous for his compassionate depiction of people of the bottom of American Society," In this book, like so many of his others, he describes the time period, social events, and gives a clear pictures of what life was like. Steinbeck is mostly known for his great attention to detail and his sense of social justice in Of Mice and Men. George is a small man, who not only has himself to look after but also has the job of looking after and caring for his mentally delayed friend Lennie. George said, "Whatever we ain't got, that's what you want. God a'mighty, if I was alone I could live so easy. I could go get a job an' work, an no trouble. No mess at all, and when the end of the month come I could take my fifty bucks and go into town and get whatever I want" (11-12). As they grow up they find the true friendship they have is so important, along with the commitment to one another. This great novel will remain a classic forever.

review/text: The Autobiography of Benjamin Franklin was a comical adventure through a life that expresses the ways of an ideal American. Franklin was a husband, friend, printer, inventor, scientist, writer, educator, diplomat, and a politician. Franklin's style of writing was cheerfully humorous (how his friend sucked at writing poems was my personal favorite part) and was made even better by the fact that he was able to laugh at himself. I enjoyed his take on the public's opinion of his papers on his experiments with electricity. He did not get defensive because of his cool, confident personality. I loved the part about the other scientist, Abb&eacute; Nollet, who 'could not at first believe that such a work came from America, and said it must have been fabricated by his enemies at Paris, to decry his system.' Overall the book was entertaining and a classic story, but I do not think that I would call it a favorite.

review/text: Meursault, a frenchman living in Algeria (poor guy) lives a normal life. His mother died (does it mather?), he started dating Marie (don't speak of love) and he helped his &quot;friend&quot; Raymond when some Arabs wanted to attack him. He is a complete stranger to others, you don't know what he feels. All you know: he hates hot and sunny places and doesn't understand what he can't smell, touch or eat. Then he kills and is sent to prison. There he finally understands lifes meaning, the absurdity, what it all ment. Is it too late?I was agreably surprised when I read this book. Usually, what we read in French Litterature is horrible (like Zola, Maupassant, ...) but this was quite nice, perhaps a little boring at times. The story is short and you read it very fast. The characters are quite sympatic, even if Meursault is a little strange.It's really easy to analyse after you've understood how it works. I got the best marks when I analysed it at school. It's funny to read it after you've analysed it, because the story is much more deeper. It's a fine base for a philosophical debate on the absurdity of life and Camus has got some interessing ideas.You should really read it in French like I did, it's a lot better and the traslation is sometimes weird.If you're a teacher and want your class to read something more enjoyable than Zola, choose this book. Some can enjoy it (not me).

You need to generate the laughs or it becomes loose and falls flat.

review/text: Terrible adaptation of the great comic book "Hellblazer" is nothing short of a spit in the eye of the fans of the comic book with a terrible and down right crude performance by Keanu Reeves, who makes a joke out of one of the most beloved cult comic book characters made in the last twenty years. His performance is bad to the point of wanting to throw something at the screen just out of sheer rage. The screenplay is a joke and the dialog rages from bad to much worse as the movie progresses and the special effects are so badly done that the monsters would have been better off if they were puppets instead. Some of the actors in the film are better than the film itself with great performances by Rachel Weisz, who is the only ray of light this movie really has and Djimon Hounsou, who is the only actor who does his comic book character any justice. Despite Rachel Weisz, the movie is bad and not even her talent could have saved it.

Much credit is given to the O brother soundtrack for the current popularity of bluegrass, but it's popularity had already risen significantly as a result of this excellent album.

review/text: I just finished this and I enjoyed it immensely. Yes, there could have been more pictures, or color pictures, but the &quot;dish&quot; was terrific. Written in interview snippets with band members, associates and friends, you get a clear picture of what was actually going on with the band and behind the scenes while we were all busily worshiping Siouxsie.I learned plenty from things I must have missed reading up on since first stumbling upon the Arabian Knights video around 1981, up to and including their sad break up in 1995...Who knew that behind Robert Smith's back he was unaffectionately referred to as &quot;Fat Bob,&quot; or that PEEPSHOW was fueled most specifically by cocaine, that FEAST was hammered out in two weeks, that Siouxsie ruled the band with an iron fist (well, you HAD to know that). I still worship the music, but now I appreciate the humans who created it, whiny and childish as they seemed at times.It's a great read, I love Siouxsie's occasional foul mouth and the fact that she had the audacity to have been photographed for the cover of the book in a Burberry blouse. And you'll have fun at the end of the book highlighting all the gigs you actually saw and horrified at how many you allowed yourself to miss. (Discography and extensive index included)

review/text: I, like most people, learned much of what I knew of Ike Turner from his eighth ex-wife Tina's autobiography, I, Tina. From that time to approximately 1997 I had an ongoing fascination with finding out more about often reclusive Turner. Takin' Back My Name fills in many of the gaps left by Tina's book and by interviews that have focused more on his relationship with his wife than with his life and career. Contrary to other reviews of this book which appear on this site, Turner is not illiterate or unfamiliar with the English language -- nor is the book full of mis-spellings. It was co-authored by Nigel Cawthorne, a British journalist and printed in the United Kingdom where the spellings are &quot;proper English&quot;. When sent here to the United States, the publisher did not deem it necessary to change over spellings of words like &quot;tyre&quot; or &quot;recognise&quot;. For those looking for an in your face, honest examination of Ike &amp; Tina, look no further. Pay close attention to the fight that takes place in Texas the prefaced Tina's departure. It takes checking out both books to get a clearer understanding of what made Ike and Tina Turner both spectacular AND volatile.

review/text: There is nothing bad I can say about Fela, there really isn't. The man was a cultural and political phenomenon inspiring countless amounts of fellow Africans to take a stand. Think in the terms of Bob Marley, but do I dare to say Fela was more important? Uh, yes. (Meanwhile, I just made the entire faux post-hippie movement choke on their bong smoke)."Music Is The Weapon" prooves to be the perfect title for Fela's 'best of' songs. He fought soley with art and became so powerful at it that he opened and performed religiously at his own night club, using it as a politcal pulpit. After gaining international acclaim, Fela was eventually gunned down after a concert so he could be kept quiet, only to survive and continue his fight. Parallels could be noted about Marley, however, Nigeria had more urgent problems than Jamaica.Fela was a versatile musican, not only did he sing and write his own compositions, he played keyboards and saxaphone while directing his band and singers. Many people compare him as Africa's James Brown because the music uncontestedly FUNKY. It is a fair agreement. JB is the Godfather of Soul and Fela is the Godfather of Afrobeat, although Fela is much active in his human rights awareness. And smarter, seeing that James Brown endorsed Richard Nixon.In whole, this collection is a great starting point for getting into this truely one-of-a-kind artist. It acts as a 'greatest hits' despite the two problems I have with this release:1- It does not highlight the broad range of music and time eras Fela recorded in, but remember, the music selections are by no means poor examples of greatness and originality.2- Many of the track selections are only parts or edits of the full-length versions, but keep in mind that some of these 'edited' versions are still 8-14 minutes long. If they were not cut, we would be looking at half an hour jams right up there with electric Miles Davis funkiness."Music Is The Weapon" also contains a third disc that documents Fela's musical life and political beliefs on DVD while displaying live performances and interviews with the man himself. Fela's mission was to make you aware while making you dance, both in a gracefully artistic manner.I suggest researching the life of Fela. In turn, the music will make more sense to us living in western society.

review/text: How I came to write this review:Having acquired a couple of new guitars in the past year, I decided to sell off a few of my older ones. One of these, a 1967-era Framus 6-string acoustic, I listed on our local Craig's List and heard from Etienne the same day. Within hours, we met at an outdoor mall near my home ( he told me I would be able to recognize him as he is told he resembles Jackson Browne - and he DOES!), where he tried (and played, to my delight, quite a bit) decided to buy the guitar and took it to his car. I gave him a break on the asking price and he gave me, in turn,a copy of this CD.Etienne is a musician, composer and performer. He has written the 15 tunes he performs on this CD and they run a broad range of musical genres from straight acoustic instrumental, to accompanied songs with his own vocals - some are of the 'classic' folk-type, one or two even mildly describable as 'protest' or 'opinion' songs - all smooth, well crafted and highly personal. I had never heard of him before this, but have listened to the CD many times in the past two months - liking it better each and every time.As a musician, his fretboard work is both clearly defined and delicate; as a singer, his voice is soothing, honest and yet humanly imperfect and as a composer and writer, his blend of old style with new and personal themes is outstanding. Amongst my most favorable comments is that this CD is NOT overproduced. Etienne actually coproduced it with Dan Prothero and their production touches are light- giving the total listening experience more the qualities of listening to a live performance in a small, intimate venue than that of a heavily engineered studio-produced and re-edited piece. This is definitely a guitar-centered album, and while it sounds as though there are other instruments on some of the pieces, no other performers are listed on the jacket - so I must infer that the other instrumental sounds are either synthesized or recorded by Etienne himself and then dubbed into the primary track. I simply don't know.For those of you interested in the specifics of the cuts, they are as follows:1. Meditation # C.O.B.2. Juniper Rosa3. The Lizard Song4. Providence5. Six Feet6. Big Black Wall7. There's Real and There's Moonshine8. Bama Bino Goodbye9. You Became A Knife10. Come Twilight11. Everybody Thinks You're A Smash12. Goodnight*** promo only solo tracks***13. Cerebro14. The Lizard Song15. Everybody Thinks You're A SmashThis is how I like it and probably why I am so taken with the CD as a whole. Having had some personal contact with the artist - I must admit - probably influences my relationship to the music.The CD can be found in the catalogue of Fog City Records, catalogue number FCCD 008.If you like your music honest, real and human - I think there is a good chance you will enjoy the work of Etienne de Rocher and this particular CD.

The transliteration is so weird that you actually have to learn two new languages before pronouncing anything closely right. I tried the book with several english speaking lao persons and lao speaking native english speakers while travelling around the country and all had problems with the transliteration. Nothing is like you would naturally pronounce it. For example who would say Khoj if you see Khawy?Helpful is the lao bit so you can point, in the end its how I got around. A pity, there are much better transliterations around.

review/text: OK, this stuff works great because it's very strong. I had a wart on my hands that was there for YEARS and not it's gone. I even had my doctor freeze it twice and it still didn't go away. This stuff got rid of it in about 15 days.HERE'S THE TIP:The key is to isolate the wart so the medication doesn't affect the good skin. This is especially important for small warts.Tip #1: Take a large plastic bandage (not fabric), and cut off the two sticky sides and throw away the padded portion in the middle. Take one of the sticky sides (save the other one for later) and with the backing still on it and fold it into four (half and half again). Now cut the center corner off to make a small hole in the middle - you want the hole just a tiny bit bigger than the wart. Then unfold it, take the backing off, and apply it on your wart with the wart sticking out of the hole. Now you can apply a big glob of the Wart Stick medication and you wont have to worry about it killing the surrounding good skin. Apply an second full bandage on top of the medication and you're good to go.Tip #2: Make sure you apply the medication after a shower when the skin is soft and more penetrable.Tip#3: If you have a stubborn wart, do it in intervals. Apply the medication for 2-3 days, then leave it uncovered and unmedicated for a day or two so it can harden and peel off. Then repeat. My stubborn wart took three rounds but with some patience, it did finally go away.

It seems to me by reading his &quot;see more about me&quot; profile that he is biased towards...well, you should read it for yourself. Being educated in music means NOTHING to me. What does mean something is an honest evaluation of Clay's singing. It is not screaming to me; it is EMOTING quite well. Plus the songs are something you can identify with and sing along to. (Maybe Mr. Jeanthom11 also needs to educate himself in punctuation: it is not apostrophe s in this instance -- that shows possession -- there should be NO apostrophes after the words. This only shows ignorance to me and further indicates he is not as educated as he wishes people to think.) Maybe some people don't realize that the more they criticize this marvelous person with an equal marveluous voice, the more we WANT to buy it and listen to it to see for ourselves, which I HAVE AND SIMPLY ADORE IT.I DON'T MEAN TO BE RUDE, BUT...

If you listen, really listen, to this CD you will understand why it has achieved that milestone.

review/text: NO SPOILERS, NO FEARS! I do mention what it parodies in parts, but no scenes are actually given.The whole parody movie thing goes way back to the 60s and 70s with classics like Blazing Saddles and the Monte Python movies and beyond. Lately, in the new wave of parodies: Austin Powers, Scary Movie, etc, they have usually gone into simple, incomplex story lines based on movies that have been recently featured, or as some would consider overrated. Date Movie does this, but unsuccessfully.SYNOPSIS: Julia (Hannigan) is a fat, lonely girl that is looking for a fairy tale Mr. Right, with parents having high expectations of meeting their family's cultural boundaries: African-American, Indian, Japanese, AND Jewish. To help meet this Mr. Right, she goes to 'Hitch' and is 'Pimped' to be the Alyson Hannigan we know and love today. With her new slender body, she goes onto a reality show, where she meets Mr. Right, but not her parent's view of Mr. Right. Somehow he must make her parents feel comfortable with the marriage, accept him as their son-in-law, and avoid the temptations of his ex girlfriend.A real problem with Date Movie is that it really doesn't go with a strait theme. Date Movie implies that it is a parody of chick flicks, romance movies, and comedies. It branchs off however going into odd questionable movie situations like, Kill Bill. Also, there are a lot of movies that were used that weren't widely seen, or were too old for a lot of younger people to actually catch the intended joke. Unfortunately, this doesn't appeal to any older folks, so the jokes are completely lost.Another major problem, and probably the biggest, is that it throws each parody at you in rapid succession. Suddenly its Meet the Parents/Fockers, to Big Fat Greek Wedding, to Pretty Woman, to Say Anything, and even the Bachelor, all within a 10 minute period what it seems. This incredibly short 80 MINUTE MOVIE!! has all these parodies, but unlike Scary Movie, which has many of the same writers, doesn't stay with one or two story lines. Scary Movie one parodies Scream, Scary Movie 2 parodies House on Haunted Hill, and although a large portion of Scary Movie 3 was dedicated to 8 Mile, and a small to the Matrix, it was mostly Signs and the Ring, and meshed much better. All branch offs in this movie were sporatic and random, having nothing to do with plot enhancement.Finally, this movie just wasn't that funny. There are no memorable scenes from this movie that you can joke around with your friends the next day, not memorible scenes that just made you laugh so hard to pee yourself... all jokes fell flat, and made you feel like they tried way to hard to make you laugh. THe most you'll get out of this movie is a har har. It was to some extend entertaining, and you kept watching just to know what happened, but its a one time see at best!BOTTOM LINE: DOLLAR FLICK!! (Maybe on Tuesdays for 50 cents)

review/text: The Third Secret follows the typical suspense/thriller model. It is adequately interesting to keep one reading. The early pages filled with interesting bits of information about the Vatican's history. However, (And I won't give away the secret) at about page 350, the book takes a dive. Steve Berry apparently thinks that no one will object when he shoves in his personal views on divisive church issues. But whether you agree with him or not, the revelation is completely unwarranted. I suppose Berry was trying to set his religious thriller in the same vein as Dan Brown's "heretical" books. In the end the book devolves into a treastise of Berry's personal views, presented in a way that debate is impossible. That added to the absolutely deplorable behavior by the story's protagonists (which Berry makes no attempt to challenge) makes this book a disappointing read at best.

The TrueRenu store gives you cute little pahmplets with details on all the ingredients, and insturctions (the packages are written in Japanese so you need to read their instructions) - and I even got a free gift of green tea - yum!

review/text: This film doesn't really seem to fit in one genre. Some call it a suspense film, others say it's horror. No doubt,this film is in a class of it's own, as is the film's director.In this movie, a young couple by the name of Rosemary and Guy move into an apartment in New York. Rosemary is a housewife, Guy is an aspiring actor. The apartment they move into was owned by a woman who died in mysterious circumstances, the next door neighbours are an elderly couple named Roman and Minnie.When the young woman living with them dies from an apparent suicide, Rosemary reaches out to them, and they accpet her friendship with a lot more than just open arms.Rosemary falls pregnant, but instead of being a joyous occasion, bizarre and deadly events begin to happen all around Rosemary. And it all seems to revolve around her unborn child, she soon becomes convinced that the couple next door belong to a coven and that they want her baby for their own evil purposes. But with no friends, and nobody to believe her Rosemary begins to fight against the conspiracy, believing that her own husband is involved too.This has all of the trademark Polanski things: an apartment, a main character whose sanity and grip on reality you come to question, claustrophobic settings.This was the film that made Mia Farrow a bona fide star, eclipsing that of her then husband Frank Sinatra. It also made Roman Polanski a household name in America.This film is more a suspense than a horror film, but nevertheless it is superb in every way.

review/text: Ah, Ulysses. What can one say that has not already been said? It seems that everyone who has read it, and indeed even those who have not, has an opinion regarding Joyce's seminal work. And now, after finally turning over the last page, I hereby add my own name to the long list of critics who have attempted to analyze this novel, and who, although perhaps unwittingly, have also added to the length of the grin on the face of its author--that eloquent literary trickster, that infuriating kicker-of-the-wheels of language, old double J himself.What immediately strikes you upon reading the first few pages of Ulysses is that, despite the cloud of mystique surrounding it, it is only a novel--a collection of words written by one man. It is not, as some would have you believe, some sort of prophetic vision of mankind, a work of art so highly conceived and perfectly executed that it transcends all space and time. No, it is only, as all books are, a story. And thereby it can be reduced to this: a man wakes up, walks around, and then goes to sleep. If you're looking for anything more than that, then keep looking--because you won't find it here. It is simply the story of one long (and I do mean long) day.But the plot is of little importance in this book. What the author wants you to focus on is style and meaning; and there is plenty of both to go around. In fact, there is too much. When Joyce attempts to reconstruct the evolution of the english language in a mock birth of modern speech and literature, he crosses the line that separates amusing people from annoying ones. In passages throughout the book--too numerous to mention in this limited review space--you often get the urge to say to its author, &quot;Okay, that's enough; we get it already.&quot; But on and on he goes, confusing you, irritating you, making you wish you had never started reading this damn book in the first place. So why keep reading, you ask? Because there are parts of the book, again too numerous to mention, that for sheer beauty and clarity of description rival anything ever written. Joyce's portrait of a grizzled old sailor in a scene towards the end of the book quickly comes to mind as a shining reminder that there are rewards for making the long and sometimes frustrating journey on which he wishes to take you.And that, I suppose, is what Ulysses is all about. You love it at times, you hate it at times, but by the time you reach the end you feel, well, something. And no more should we expect of our authors.

review/text: I very much enjoyed this movie. Unlike some others, I didn't think it was too long, or the English subtitles mysterious, or the Africans shallow. I particularly liked that for once an African character is central to the story, and more than just decoration. Sure, he was "just" the cook, but the extent to which the family came to respect, rely, and TRUST him made him part of them.I won't describe the plot, as that has already been done by many reviewers.Having lived in Kenya, I have to say that the European actors did a fine job with the Swahili, considering they were just memorized lines. Their delivery was natural, with the obvious caveat of the heavy accents. But even so, they all spoke like they understood what they were saying.I also thought this was a most unusual Holocaust movie and, while ever present, the Holocaust is not bashed over the viewer's head. It was a good balance.Furthermore, the characters were all pretty complex; the director could easily have fallen into superficial cliche, but did not. The love between husband and wife is frequently complex and conflicted, and this was illustrated artfully.If you like films about Africa, or complex, real-life type of love stories, or are interested in a virtually unknown aspect of the Haolocaust and WWII, this is your film.

review/text: You have to have an affinity for what is most loathsome in human nature to appreciate the unrelenting vileness and a-morality celebrated in this movie. Okay, whether it is actually celebrated is, of course, arguable. However, this movie does nothing more than show us sordidness after sordidness: Teenage Telly practicing his favorite pasttime (next to getting high, perhaps)--painfully deflowering very young virgins; Telly kicking some poor slob nearly to death. Sex, drugs, sex, drugs, ad tedium.This movie might show us what *some* kids indulge in, but it really shows us nothing new, leads us to no new understanding of, well, anything under the sun except perhaps our own stoicism should we heroically make it through the entire movie.In a word: Blech!

review/text: Miserable Keanu Reeves film that is one of the worst movies ever made. Keanu is more than miscast in this film, he makes the film a real chore to watch with his horrible acting and lousy delivery of his lines. This is not his fault because he can be a good actor when he has the right material but he's not working with a full deck here and he's as bad as the film itself. The rest of the film is as bad as he is with a story that makes no sense and direction by music director who does not know the hell he is doing with the movie he's making. Some plot points go no where in terms of furthering the story a long and certain revelations don't makes any sense at all with the overall story. The special effects are not handled well and you really can't see much of the movie at all with how dark it is. Only Rachel Weisz and Peter Stormare do well with what they got and they both make this film bearable with their better than the script performances. Weisz deserves all the praise she is getting for her performance, and that's really because she's does give a better performance than the movie as a whole and Stormare does well with his ten minute cameo and does a better job with his role than most of the actors in the entire film.Now I have not read the comic book on which this film is based on but I hope it's a hell of a lot better than this lousy film.

review/text: First of all, I'm not a typical Clay Aiken fan. I'm not a teenage girl, or a drooling middle-age woman who thinks Clay's the greatest thing since Bobby Darin. I'm a fortysomething male (and no, I'm not gay) who saw Clay on "American Idol," felt there was something "magical" (in the words of Gladys Knight) about him and became an instant fan. And while "Measure of a Man" may not be a classic CD, or even one for the ages, so to speak, I find it to be one of the most satisfying, and refreshingly honest pieces of music of the year. Twelve songs and not a clinker in the bunch, all exceedingly listenable and unpretentious and and beautifully sung by a young man with incredible vocal pipes and an uncanny sense of what works for himself and his audience.The highlights: First single "Invisible," the title tune, "Touch," and the incredible power ballad "I Survived You," which Clay should have dedicated to the lunk-headed judges who clearly favored last year's head-scratcher-of-a-winner Ruben Studdard, whose entire act consisted of bad Luther Vandross imitations.Lowlights: None, although if I have any complaints with "MOAM" it's that there are one-or-two-too-many sound-alike ballads in the middle of the album and not enough acoustic, quiet moments that truly showcase Clay's vocal mastery. Also, there are too many producers working independently on each song, so the album does come across as overproduced, which is one of the few legitimate critical complaints against this album.Regardless, this is a fine debut project from a young man who is going to be around a lot longer than his air-brained critics like to think. Yes, it would be nice if Clay displayed more "edge" in future projects, but there's something to be said about an artist who isn't afraid to present a product that appeals to those of us who would rather listen to anything other than critical darlings like Outkast and gutter rappers like 50 Cent.Sorry, critics. Clay Aiken's the real deal. Now deal with it.

When I watched the first episode of "Alias", I couldn't believe how blatantly they were stealing from "Run Lola Run".It's fun, it's fast-paced, it has a great soundtrack and it's worthy of some respect. Plus, I think Franka Potente is remarkably sexy in this movie.The DVD has some okay extras. If you're not into reading your films, then you can access the english overdub.

review/text: This movie, The Odyssey, was a wonderful movie. The main character was Odysseus. He was played by Armand Assante. His wife was Penelope, played as Greta Scacchi. It started out in 1300 B.C. The movie started out with his son, Telemachus, played as Alan Stenson. Then, Odysseus was sent out to fight in the Trojan War. The Greeks won. Before he left he told Penelope that she would have to promise him that if his son had grown a beard before he returned, then she must marry someone else. After ten years at the Trojan War, Odysseus and his men were headed back home to Ithica. Many different things happened to them on the way home. First of all, the God of the Wind, Aeolis, gives Odysseus bags of wind. A curious guy on the boat named Anticlus, played as William Houston, let out all the bad winds. The boat switched and headed another way. Hermes, the messenger god, told Odysseus and his men that the witch needed them. Hermes gave Odysseus leaves to eat to keep the curse away. Odysseus climbed the mountains to the castle of Circe. She turned Odysseus men to animals. She(Circe) fell in love with Odysseus. She made him sleep with her, and it ends up he stays there for five years. After that, they got into their boat, and rode it into the Underworld. He sees his mother in the Underworld. In the Underworld, he went to see the blind phrophet. The phrophet tells Odysseus that he will fo fight two bad creatures, the Silla and the Curiptus. They meet up with Silla(mythological creature). It had several heads. It looked like a giant worm with heads and teeth. The Curiptus had a big mouth. The Curiptus shut its mouth and spewed water on everyone. Odysseus fell into the water. Back home, Penelope, was making a death shawl just in case Odysseus didn't come back. Her idea was to thread all day, and take it back out at night time. Then, it would be longer before he would have to choose another man to marry. Then, Odysseus ended up at some sort of place in the middle of the ocean. The lady, Calypso, played as Vanessa Williams. She kept him there for two more years, but then she was sad, because she had to let him go. He headed back home to Ithica. On the way, Odysseus met up with Poseidon, God of Sea. He(Poseidon) had been trying to teach Odysseus a lesson. Poseidon told him that if it wasn't for gods or goddesses, then humans wouldn't be here. Back home, Penelope and Odysseus mother were sqeezing olives to make olive oil. Finally,Odysseus makes it back home to Ithica. A lady there turns him to look like an older guy. Only his son, Tiresias, could recognize him. The men waiting for Penelope's hand in marriage were getting ready to find out who her next husband was. Odysseus sat back watching. The men had to shoot an arrow through twelve hoops. No one could do it except Odsseus. Then, all of a sudden Odysseus stepped u and shot the arrow through all twelve of the hoops. He turned back into his old self again. He killed all of those men. Odysseus and his family lived happily ever after. In this movie, my favorite character was Calypso played as Vanessa Williams. She played it really good. I felt sorry for her, because she had to let Odysseus go back home to Ithica.

review/text: Having just re-read 1984 it struck me that, whilst the quality of the writing is "timeless," (Orwell constructs a better sentence than most "literary artists"), the book's themes get more and more frightening as Western culture decays toward the millennium. My first school reading was in the days when 1984 was literally "the future," (even though Orwell had always intended it as a satire on contemporary Britain, with "1948" the originally intended title); in England today the resonances are especially profound, and what looked "old-fashioned" to `sixties and `seventies sci-fi readers has gained a new and bleaker realism. We're beginning to catch up with the US when it comes to presidential-style "leadership" and "spin," whilst the rewriting of history - with its horrible parallels with the politically correct mythologies espoused in transatlantic universities and the like - is already being implemented, with particular regard to the guilty denial of the achievements of the British Empire, (whilst the Roman and Greek civilisations still manage to escape trendy censure).The worst shock comes with the realisation that everything 1984 says about the manipulation and reduction of thought by language-control, (Doublethink and Newspeak, respectively), is demonstrably happening right now. Things you can't say become thoughts you can't think, and an attempted conversation with most contemporary English youths on the street will reveal how hard it has become for our ill-educated masses actually to formulate rationale thought: what you get is a monotonic patois recitation of received simplistic opinion - or a boot stamping on your face, followed by a law-suit for your assault on them! One recent encounter left me with the reflection that we are so far from Shakespeare one could weep; then I read 1984 again, where Orwell has Winston wake up one morning with the name on his lips, a fleeting memory of a better past. The book is brilliantly written, shockingly painful and horribly, horribly relevant! (It's also fantastically entertaining and often very funny). Read it, read it again, and read it to your children!

review/text: 'One hundred Years of Solitude' is not an easy book, make no mistake about it. Or at least it is not an easy book to begin with. However, its mellifluous, dreamlike narrative, and touching appreciation of so many facets of human nature seep into the subconscious as the story of Macondo's existence unfolds, and I defy anyone to put it down if he or she is patient enough to read the first hundred pages or so.Gabriel Garcia Marquez has created a miniature world in which the inhabitants seem to be afflicted by all the horrors of human society at the same time. The novel is crammed full of so much magical imagery that at times it seems like there is nothing more that the author could have put in, yet the focus is incredibly narrow, concentrating almost exclusively on the fortunes of one incredible family.Ultimately, as Marquez doubtlessly intended, the reader emerges from the final pages as if from a slightly surreal, yet utterly fascinating dream; to adequately describe a century-worth of history in under 350 pages may seem like an impossible feat, but the author does just that and more at the denouement, by entirely subverting all that has gone before.This book is essential reading for anyone with even the slightest interest in mythology, history, sociology or just good old-fashioned story-telling.

review/text: How often have you encountered a book on Shakespeare or his works that attains a level of writing that is often heart-meltingly gorgeous, even at times comparable to the beauty of the Shakespeare quotations it contains? Probably only once, and this is the book.A helpful introduction by David Lehman reminds us that Mark Van Doren was a celebrated professor of literature at Columbia University, and a poet of considerable accomplishment, who served as mentor to a long list of students who later achieved great things. In his courses he generally spoke without notes, and this 1939 book on Shakespeare's works was also written without notes or references, other than a well-thumbed one-volume edition of the works, printed in about 1906.Any modest power of description which I might possess fails utterly for this exquisite book. Instead, let me give a sample of Van Doren's commentary: "It may well be that Shakespeare in 'The Tempest' is telling us for the last time, or consciously for the last time, about the world. But what he is telling us cannot be simple, or we could agree that it is this or that. Perhaps it is this: that the world is not simple. Or, mysteriously enough, that it is what we all take it to be. Any set of symbols, moved close to this play, lights up as if in an electric field. Its meaning, in other words, is precisely as rich as the human mind, and it says that the world is what it is. But what the world is cannot be said in a sentence. Or even in a poem as complete and beautiful as 'The Tempest.'"

review/text: Schreker's "Das Spielwerk und der Prinzessin" is a remarkable little opera. Typical of Schreker's operas, it's a wildly imagined fairy tale with lots of weird pseudo-Freudian subtext.Schreker wrote in an ulta-rich, ambitious, romantic-expressionist idiom--complex both harmonically and orchestrally. Schreker pursued unusual orchestral timbres with great imagination. His music is garish and irridescent.Schreker seems to glory in his ability to conjure up strangely imagined worlds of magic, romance, sexual depravity, and in the case of "Spielwerk", purification. His characters are often strange blends of earnestness and corruption--in some cases these blends border on being so far from real human experience that they're unsympathetic or dramatically unconvincing. But in "Spielwerk", I think he does a better job than in some other operas, and the language of his librettos (which he always wrote himself) is always beautiful.The story of "Spielwerk" is downright weird, and can't be explained simply!In the backstory of "Spielwerk", the old craftsman Master Florian had spent a his lifetime crafting a musicbox that produces music of unearthly beauty, but only came alive when his son played his violin. The Princess who ruled from a nearby castle began holding wild orgiastic parties where she would strip off her robes and "yield" to her male guests. Master Florian's wife, his assistant "Wolf", and his son were all eventually seduced by the parties, where his son, now the Princess's lover, would play the musicbox, driving the revellers to even wilder excesses. So Master Florian renounced his wife, and drove his son from his house out into the world. The music box fell silent.In the beginning of the opera, Master Florian's son has died, and is brought to his cabin's door, where his now penitent wife urges him to take the boy's body inside. He refuses. A mysterious travelling flute player happens by, and is invited by Florian to stay with him. When the guest plays his noble music, the musicbox suddenly, to Master Florian's surprise, comes to life!The Princess, now despondent at having lost her lover and the music of the "Spielwerk", plans one final party, and asks "Wolf" to burn her and her guests to death upon it's completion. The flute player meets the Princess by chance on the road, and they feel drawn to one another. He thinks she's just a common woman, and when she urges him to run away with her to start a new life, he's tempted. But he tells her that he has come to heal and redeem the Princess, and that until he does so, he cannot leave. She tells him of the Princess's terrible corruption, and that she cannot be healed. But he is immovable.The party begins, but is interrupted by a mob led by Master Florian's former wife. They threaten to tear the Princess to pieces. But at the last moment, the flute player intervenes, playing his flute. At that moment the musicbox responds. Florian's son's corpse sits up and begins to play his violin along with the Spielwerk's wonderous tones, and all the listeners are entranced. The flute player and the Princess dance together, singing ecstatically, and wend their way slowly towards the distant castle. "Wolf" and his cohorts burn Master Florian's cabin to the ground, finally silencing the musicbox.During the second decade of the 20th century, Schreker became the second most successful living opera composer in the German speaking world, second only Strauss. "Spielwerk" was his one dud in a string of successes--following "Der ferne Klang", and preceeding "Die Gezeichneten" and "Der Schatzgraber", each which was more successful than the last. He revised "Spielwerk", cutting it's already brief length (100 minutes). But the revision was also a flop. This recording, from the enterprising Kiel Opera, is a reconstruction of the original version.I can't help but recommend this strange little operatic hallucination!

review/text: There really isn't much I can add to what has already been said about this wonderful Thomas Hardy novel. One of the things that really struck me about Tess was the importance of setting and how Hardy relates Tess's emotional state to the setting in which she finds herself. The contrasting settings of Talbothays Dairy and Flintcomb-Ash seem to represent the opposing forces in Tess's own life.At Talbothays, the air is &quot;clear, bracing and ethereal,&quot; the river flows like the pure River of Life,&quot; and the atmosphere &quot;set up (Tess's) spirits wonderfully.&quot; For Tess, the valley where the dairy is located is akin to Paradise and she feels an emotional high while she is there.In the dairy, itself, the milkers form &quot;a little battalion of men and women,&quot; often &quot;singing songs to entice the cows to produce milk.&quot; Everyone works together to bring about a common goal, a common good. At Talbothays, Tess is able to escape the pressures and prejudices of Victorian England. She is at the peak of happiness in her life and falls in love and marries the intellectual and difficult Angel Clare.It is when her marriage to Angel fails, that Tess moves to the dreary and desolate Flintcomb-Ash. Flintcomb-Ash is in direct contrast to Talbothays. There is not a single &quot;green pasture,&quot; nor anything besides &quot;fallow and turnips everywhere&quot; at the &quot;starve-acre place.&quot; Here, Tess reaches a new emotional low and her heart is as empty and dark as the setting in which she finds herself. In contrast to the camaraderie at Talbothays, at Flintcomb-Ash, &quot;nobody come near (Tess)&quot; as she stands &quot;enshrouded in her uniform&quot; working &quot;hour after hour.&quot; The other workers at Flintcomb-Ash do not fare much better and most are kept busy in the fields in order to earn enough money to simply survive. There is no time for friendship in this place.Obviously, Hardy was a master at description and the use of setting to emphasize the emotional state of his characters, Tess in particular. Although this book is a masterpiece of sensual language, Tess is also a wonderful example of the use of contrasting settings to convey strong emotional states in a way that mere words alone never could. Tess is a book that should not be overlooked by anyone.

review/text: Ellen Glasgow is definitely an underrated American female writer; how many have heard of her? She writes elegantly and truthfully. The setting for Vein of Iron is an area of rural Virginia where I spent much of my childhood. I don't think it has changed much! In this novel, there are wonderful passages about the impact of Christian beliefs on the life of the people who settled in the region (which can surely be generalized to many rural settlements throughout the U.S.). Glasgow creates a fascinating character in Ada's father, who struggles with his spirituality. Ada is strong, faithful, optimistic- just as I imagined our female predecessors to be at that time. This is a character-driven, setting-driven novel, and I loved it. My daughter surprised me with it for mother's day. Thanks, daughter!

review/text: Welcome to Hammer's outstanding &quot;Hands of the Ripper&quot;, one of the studio's last movies and one of their best. The story tells of Anna, a young girl who is actually Jack the Ripper's daughter, and who was traumatised as a toddler by witnessing a vicious killing (seen in the prologue). Now an adult, she is prone to murderous seizures which provide the many grisly highlights of the film. It sounds rather lurid, but the film takes the subject seriously, and as a whole, the plot is tremendously engaging. Anna's rages are only triggered by a specific set of circumstances, and the script creates a surprising and clever staging for each one, following on every time with a suitably gory slaughter. The film features great performances from its prestigious cast, particularly Angharad Rees who is luminously beautiful as Anna, and Eric Porter as the doctor who realises her identity but is compelled to try and cure her rather than turn her in (as well as falling for her charms, as she has no recollection of what she does when she goes into a trance). Of course, in the movies such a situation can only end in tragedy, and the climax of the story is elegantly downbeat and very effective. The period London setting, the photography and the directing all fall perfectly into place, and &quot;Hands of the Ripper&quot; can be judged as one of Hammer's greatest acheivements. It's crying out for a DVD release, so hopefully someone will take the initiative very soon. There is a UK region 2 release, but it's only available as a box set with two far inferior British 70's horror movies &quot;The Monster&quot; and &quot;The Uncanny&quot;. I was lucky and got one from a split set, but it's a real shame that most people will miss out on enjoying this movie by it not getting the circulation it deserves.

review/text: I have read through the other posts for Prairie Wind, and everyone's comparisons of Priaire Wind to this Neil album or that Neil album - always a waste of time with any artist that grows older and changes with the time. I do understand some of the frustration of some of the listeners - you can't always follow even your favorite artists through all of their phases. Heck, I lost Springsteen in the 80's, and have only enjoyed his two acoustic albums since (I don't even want to talk about Devils and Dust). But we are discussing Neil's new album . . .I found it comforting, emotionally moving in its personal touches (especially his thoughts on his dad), and Falling Off the Face . . . is simply a beautiful love song from the perspective of a man who struggles to make his emotions known. The only thing that bugged me a bit was using the orchestration a little heavy handed on too many of the tracks. I prefer the raw sound. I honestly cannot reccommend a better fall album than Prairie Wind, and I look forward to grabbing my lawn seat this summer to watch Ol'Neil givin' it to us live. For those who missed the Greendale concerts, I am sorry to tell you that you missed one of the greatest performances of any musician in the thirty years that I have been attending concerts.

The character of Constantine, while not faithful to the comic, is a very good one - he's delightfully bitter, resigned, and yet at the same time determined to beat fate.Gabriel is just completely screwy.Balthazaar and all the other characters make things fun as the story developes.

review/text: As a father of a daughter with autism, i was surprised by how little time the author contributed to the family life. More time was spent at work and then writing a book when it sounds like home would have been the place to be at this critical time for his family. He writes often about don't critize until you've walked in my shoes yet he has no problems bashing the GFCF diet which has proved helpful to many families. while written with great love for his son, i am not sure his priorities are in order.

review/text: In the midst of a rising number of superhero/comicbook films, "Batman Begins" stands as a mark against which all others should be measured from here on. Until I saw this film this summer, I said as much about both Spider-Man movies. Sam Rami's take on Peter Parker focuses on his character as much, if not more, than on his powers and daring deeds. Yet both S-1 and S-2 nearly fell into the same trap created by the earlier Superman and Batman films in that we got more about the villians than the main characters."Batman Begins" is a great movie, period. You can enjoy it if you've never seen another Batman film, or another superhero film for that matter, or even if you've never read a single issue of the comic. It may start a bit slow, showing Bruce Wayne's evolution into the Batman, but every second of screen time devoted to it is necessary to the story and allows even those well versed in the character to see and understand this tortured man's evolution into the avenging Dark Knight. And it is the most faithful redition yet of the character as he has been presented by Bob Kane, Dennis O'Neil and Neil Adams, and Frank Miller.Drawing inspiration from all of the above, the screenplay by Chris Nolan and David Goyer is tight and emotion-packed as well as filled with marvelous action pieces. Their Batman is indeed a "creature of the night...black...terrible...." Several moments during the Batman's first appearance will make you jump as if you're watching a tense thriller or horror film. And Christian Bale's performance nails the character from every angle. There a subtlties in his portrayal--body language, expression--that in some scenes project far more than any amount of dialoue could. He carries off Bruce's numerous emotional states, as well as his facade as the "millionaire playboy" in a way that no previous actor ever has. The highest compliment I can give him is to say his presentation of the dual character Bruce Wayne/Batman ranks on par with Christopher Reeve's rendition of Clark Kent/Superman in "Superman, the Movie."As for the supporting cast, I never thought anyone could replace Michael Gough as Alfred from the Burton films, but I shouldn't have worried. Though Michael Caine looks nothing like the comic's portrayal of the faithful Wayne butler, he brings off the part with the perfection I've come to expect in Caine's performances.The big surprise to me was Gary Oldman. I've known for years that the man was an absolute chameleon of an actor, but his casting as the young Jim Gordan also raised some doubts. Until I saw the film. His Gordon is perfect. He looks, acts and sounds like Jim Gordan should. No one has ever played this character better, and it's my sincere hope that the next film(s) explore the relationship between him and Batman.As for the villians and the lead actress, here is where my only quibble with the film appears, and it's certainly not enough to eliminate a star from my rating. Liam Neeson, Cillian Murphy and Katie Holmes are all marvelous in their respective parts; however, "Batman Begins" continues the tradition of the "two-villian+love-interest" motif that now plague the superhero film genre. While not nearly as much time is devoted to their storylines or the relationship between childhood friends Bruce and Rachel Dawes, the fact that they are present gave me an, "Ugh, here we go again" moment. Without giving anything away, the next film needs to devote its plot to Batman versus a single nemisis just as the original Burton film did. And this time leave the girl out of it. Bruce may have plenty of arm-candy as Gotham's most eligible bachelor, but as in the comics, they should be only that. He shouldn't be close to, and certainly shouldn't wind up in bed with, ANY of them. Fortunately in this film the closest we get to any kind of sex between Rachel and Bruce is a somewhat chliched film-ending kiss, something that made me voice a very relieved "whew!"This is by far the best Batman film ever made. It may even be the best superhero film ever made. I'll need to see it a few more time before I decide, but now that it's coming out on DVD, I'll be able to do just that!

review/text: Calling in the Night has seventy-six different parts to it. Some are for children who are innocent and easy-going, the others are for adults who are outspoken and honest about problems and desires. You will most likely read this book through once, probably in five hours or so, then go back and read parts of it here and there many more times. I think about the stories throughout my day, then I return to the book and read them again at night. They stay with you and in my opinion that's what makes a great book!

review/text: I've read other books by Gabriel Garcia Marquez and have enjoyed them. This one left me cold, however. The story was very muddled and Marquez wrote in such a matter-of-fact style that there were no ups and downs. It was like watching a heart monitoring machine. Whether someone was being executed, eating lunch, or anything else, Marquez just stated everything very matter of factly. Also, the names in the book were far too similar for the average reader. I just wonder if the people who give this book great reviews are doing it on its own merit or whether they are afraid to break from the pack. It reminds me of the Emperor's New Clothes where everyone was afraid to admit that they didn't know the emperor didn't have clothes on for fear of looking stupid. Of course, it could just be me. I look for things that have a real plot or a real end they're striving for. I didn't find it in this book. I also found the spiritualism hard to believe such as Remedios the Beauty ascending into the heavens. That's a bit much for even a romantic person.

review/text: Written over sixty years ago, time has not diminished the capacity of this book to capture the reader's heart. This coming of age story that takes place in turn of the century Brooklyn will simply enthrall the reader with its descriptive passages and its richly developed characters. This book survives the passage of time without becoming anachronistic, because the themes upon which it touches are universal ones.The story centers on the Nolan family. The central character is the daughter, Mary Frances Nolan. Known as "Francie" to all and sundry, she is an intelligent child growing up in poverty in the tenements of Brooklyn with her charming father, a singing waiter and an alcoholic, her hard-working and practical, no-nonsense mother, and her younger brother, who enjoys favored son status in his mother's heart. Surrounding the family are a host of characters that are richly drawn and serve to add to the ambiance of the story as it enfolds.The events that transpire in the book are seen through Francie's eyes. Her family's struggle with poverty, her father's alcoholism, her mother's steely-eyed determination to keep her family afloat, and Francie's thirst for knowledge and desire for higher education all serve to make this child strong and thrive, where others might only despair. Such is Francie's strength of character. It is that strength that helps her to battle her self-doubts, her loneliness, and lack of friends, while growing up.This is a beautifully rendered story, a true American classic that will keep the reader turning its pages.

review/text: I got this book about 3 years ago, and I was really excited, because I got it for Christmas. Little did I realise I was actually getting a narative about a woman who says she can telepathically communicate with animals.Now, don't get me wrong. I have done research into the telepathic Animal Communication, even as a freshman in college right now I have done more research into it. And even though there seems to be something, I have yet to see a bonified scientific study followed by a scientific peer reviewed paper on these experiences people have. And even as a person going into a minor Psychology I know that Psychological and behavioral studies are very difficult, becuase of the amazing amount of variables that are caused by the extremely complex brain, alone. But even I can not take much of this at face value.I believe her, I don't think she is lying. I question the validity of the actual communication. Is she really linking mentally to this orca, or is this her not fully understanding the duality that many people fall into, and is she thinking that is J2 (or Granny we call her) talking to her?I really want to give her credit and I really wanted to believe her, but I can't. She didn't give me much to really grab onto as a convincing argument for her so called abilities. And she is not the first animal communicator I have done a little research on. There was one woman mentioned in "Freeing Keiko" who said that whales and dolphins were essentially extraterrestrial beings that were guiding the earth through space. Another woman said that Greyhound dogs were also extraterrestrial beings.Just the simple fact that there is glaring inconstancies between different animal communicators should be enough evidence that there really isn't too much, if anything, to Telepathic Animal Communication.It was an entertianing book, I rather enjoyed it. But I am a sceptic. And being a sceptic I would be completely honest about my position. If something really seems to make sense, I will say it does. But this book didn't. And saying that, I would not be talking about this book to my friends or family. If it does turn up in conversation, it will most likely be during our psuedopyschological studies. That is unless someone can show me a real study that is so sound as to prove me wrong. To which, if it did prove me wrong I would say so.

If you're interested in EXACTLY how to make the perfect pie crust or puff pastry, this is for you. If you find analyses of Heckers flour vs King Arthur mind-numbing, you might want to pass it up and go back to the baking chapter of The Joy of Cooking.Although it's geared towards the more serious baker, it's useful for novices too, as the instructions are very detailed and she goes to great lengths to explain why she does everything she does (this is good for bakers of all abilities, because some of her techniques are nontraditional).Many of the recipes are time consuming, but they are worth it--gorgeous to look at and delicious to taste.

review/text: 'Zorba the Greek' is a highly philosophical novel with very little plot. The narrative voice is that of an unnamed, bookish man of 35, and it is mainly engaged in contrasting his contemplative and introspective inner life with the worldview of his older friend Alexis Zorba. Zorba's motto could very well be the Latin dictum 'carpe diem' (seize the day) with a strong hedonistic component, but it goes beyond that because he is also concerned about ultimate causes and the nature of God and the presence of evil in the world. As a result of the contrasting views, the novel has a meditative and somewhat slow rhythym to it, but at the same time it is engaging and enjoyable.Certainly since Kazantzakis wrote 'Zorba the Greek' many attitudes have changed, and some readers might find the novel out of date and even reactionary in some regards. This is especially true of how women are portrayed in the novel. However, there is also the element of cultural gaps that are not easily bridged. Greek culture has always had a strong patriarchal component, and most probably Kazantzakis was trying to provide as accurate a picture as possible of a simple man with a lust for life within the context of that culture. What in the end emerges is a very Greek novel that captures interesting cultural and societal nuances at the beginning of the Twentieth Century.I don't know any Greek, but it seems to me that Carl Wildman's translation of the novel flows effortlessly and doesn't seem contrived. Wildman also provides footnotes in certain occasions, thus clarifying terms that might be obscure to Western readers.

review/text: Why is it so often that an artist's first CD is her best? Perhaps it's because there are no expectations for a first CD. Regardless of the reason, Sheena's first CD is definitely her best. She and her producer, Christopher Neil, chose 10 catchy pop songs for this album. Neil gives Sheena room to breathe life into each of these pop gems. She sounds young, excited, and sympathetic on these tracks. And I agree with the reviewer before me - when I heard the bonus tracks, I wondered why they had been cut from the original album! So often the bonus tracks are long remixes and other rarities that only an artist's mother could love, but these bonus cuts are classic Sheena. This is well worth your money.

review/text: I Spit On Your Grave is perhaps one of the best revenge stories ever told on film. The story is very captivating and the gore satisfies. Only a few revenge movies have really had an impact, And this is one of them.The story revolves around a beautiful author who is taking a peaceful and relaxing vacation in a cabin. Of course this is all blown to hell when a local man and his pals notice the young woman at a gas station. He finds it practical to follow this woman and attempt to make a play at her. When she declines, He dosen't take no for an answer.He and his pack of goons brutally rape and beat her to the point of death . But when she recovers she isn't going to let it slide that easily. She suduces the leader of these men who just so happens to have a wife and children into believing that she liked what happened. And wants more. Of course this is not the case. She gets him into a position to where he is so comfortable that he lies back and lets her cut his penis off. In a hilarious scene that is guaranteed to make a male viewer squirm.The film is controversal, But we already know that. We already know that it was considered a woman hating piece of garbage. Never the less i'm not going to go into a big story about it.I hope that you decide to purchase this film. It will make any horror fans day!

review/text: Most of what author Kevin Phillips talks about in American Theocracy seems absolutely true. The "end of oil," the huge personal, corporate, and government debt, and political ties too close to religion seem like impossible burdens for the US to bear. However, the book is so overloaded with statistics about who voted for whom in what counties for the last 150 years, the percentage rises and declines of various religious denominations, and esoteric economic theory that it will be rendered unreadable to most anyone who does manage to slog through it.On the face, it seems we're going to get an analysis of the perils of too much religious influence in politics in general in a title like "American Theocracy." But what we find is that Phillips has a particular disdain for evangelical Christians and the Southern Baptist Convention. Most of the rants directed toward that denomination are primarily directed at the denomination's role in electing both Presidents Bush. He gives historical nods to the fact that yes, both President Clinton and President Carter are Southern Baptists as is former VP Gore, but he only seems to be concerned now that Southern Baptists elected republicans, not when they rallied behind democrats.Phillips also has a condescending habit of categorizing religious denominations he seems to have little respect for. Reading his grouping of denominations into "sects" (to me "sect" carries very negative connotations the way it is primarily used in the world ) you'll basically come to find that if you don't belong to a mainline Protestant denomination (I think he names 5 -Presbyterians, original Lutherans, Methodists, Episcopalian, and Church of Christ) you belong to a "sect." Yes, Southern Baptists, Missouri Synod Lutherans, any variety of Pentecostal (another group he shows repeated disdain for apparently due to a bitter dislike for John Ashcroft), Church of the Nazarene, any "non-denominational" mega-church, or any of dozens of other denominations, he has determined you belong to a "sect." And if you are a Mormon he has determined that your religion qualifies as a "cult."It's unfortunate that he has decided to make this book one-sided in its attacks on the Bush family, republicans, and Southern Baptists. He cites, for example, the improper use of the church pulpit as a platform to promote specific political agendas or politicians as if the republicans/right wing invented it. In doing so, he's guilty of a huge double-standard by completely failing to mention the democrats' mingling of religion and politics in a stronger sense with the Rev. Jesse Jackson (who gets of one sentence mention in the whole book) and he also completely misses the highly televised clearly pandering church appearances Pres. Clinton was prone to making around elections and policy times in churches where it seemed unlikely he'd ever attend without TV cameras in tow.Another double-standard is that the whole book centers around what he sees as unwillingness of the republican party to alienate conservative Christians (who he feels are the most radical 20-30% of the electorate). (See page 348 for a summation of "blind constituency commitments" and "stagnant but entrenched politics.") But he never mentions the democrats' unwillingness to question their ties to the radical feminist elements within NOW, unions, and other left-leaning special interest groups. He misses the point that if either side were to make the radical leap of not pandering to the extreme bases, they might capture a huge majority in the middle. As far as I could tell, he makes only one nod to the democrats' blunder in this regard, on page 237 when he acknowledged that the 60s and 70s attempted by secular liberals to push all hints of religion out of public life were the first shot fired in the culture war and were what has caused such a tremendous backlash from the right. He saves until a couple of sentences in the afterword any exposing of his double-standard on the Bush dynasty when he finally owns up that the dems have enjoyed a Kennedy dynasty as well and look to be banking on a Clinton Dynasty.Despite his overwhelming use of statistics from voting results and surveys, he makes assumptions and guesses lacking data to back them up. I can't to count the number of times he cites sales and readership of the "Left Behind" book series as evidence that x% of the population probably thinks or votes this way or that. At one point he cites anonymous internet chat room economists as a source of trepidation. While his points might be valid, for such a heavily researched book with 30 pages of end-notes, such assumptions and lack of valid sources in places are major short comings.He also makes thinly veiled attempts to tie evangelical or fundamental religious beliefs to poor education, mental health, child poverty, and homicide (page 203). He almost seems nostalgic for McCarthyism when on page 245 he notes the similarities between the current efforts to expose radical right "reconstructionism" and the successful outings of communists. All part of a very elitist attitude that permeates his writing.What I did find fascinating about the book though (when he wasn't burying me in needless statistics - he needed an editor to talk some sense into him in this regard especially in chapters 5 and 6) was his ability to relate out current energy crises, looming financial crisis, and political dependence on religion to other world powers who have come and gone down the same road: the Dutch, Spanish, and British empires. He makes a strong case that the parallels in those societies to that in the 21st century US are too great to ignore. I consider myself above average in reading habits and education but much of what he presented to me went into the "wow, I didn't learn that bit of history in school." For that reason alone, I do recommend reading this book, but I'd also recommend skipping and skimming some, and being honest about your own leanings when he's criticizing someone else.

While this movie has its share of flaws and the ending is a little weak, it still was a fun ride for me. Out of the many thrillers out there, this isn't in the top bunch to see at all but it definitely is up there for originality. Now, I'm not going to get into if it was realistic or not because I don't even know but as for the movie, it's a good thriller worth a rent.The movie's about a doctor whose wife is murdered. Following this event, he is suspected of murder, relieved of his charges, loses his children to his step sister but that's not even the worst...the killer isn't found. This doctor is very troubled by this until he meets a promissing doctor working on a drug that could allow one to use the blood of a dead individual to see what they saw. Guess what. He uses it to see what his wife saw and figure out who killed his wife.The movie does has some problems but is a good rental and the flashback scenes are well made. Ray Liotta does a nice job in leading a weak cast somehow to success.

review/text: The insider here telling all is Carrie Fisher (of Princess Leia fame), daughter of crooner Eddie Fisher and songstress Debbie Reynolds. Carrie adapted the screenplay from her best-selling novel of the same name in which she tells us what it's like (through her protagonist Suzanne Vale) to drug rehab Hollywood style. As a writer she has a sharp eye for the hypocrisy of movie land culture, dysfunctional relationships, and a splendid gift for cutting one-liners. Her dialogue made the book, and is the heart and soul of the movie. Here are a few examples:"Instant gratification takes too long." (A takeoff on, and a reinvention of, the doper's "Too much is never enough.")"...Endolphin rush." (Annette Bening corrects with, "You mean enDORphin rush.")"I am so glad that I got sober now so I can be hyper-conscious for this series of humiliations." (Suzanne Vale on her life without the deadening effect of drugs.)Playing Carrie Fisher's alter ego is Meryl Streep, one of the great actresses of our time, while Shirley MacLaine, another outstanding star, plays the mother.Streep is nearly flawless as always. She just demands the camera, and she has extraordinary talent. In the finale she sings a country and western song (from Carly Simon, by the way) and she does a great job. But she seems almost absurd in the police uni (playing a part in a movie within a movie). She doesn't seem to be achieving a comedic effect and then she does, just this side of the ridiculous. But, as usual with Steep, when the camera gets on her face, we believe her.Particularly telling was the opening scene, nicely directed by Mike Nichols. I could see the familiar Palos Verdes cliffs and the shots of the ocean below. As I waited for the SoCal scene to unfold (actually it was supposed to be Mexico) I thought, "Gee, this looks like a cheap MOW set," and I continued to be fooled as Streep is hauled from customs by the customs officer and slapped. It is only when they go to "cut!" and the movie within the movie is exposed that I realized why the set looked cheap. (Because it was supposed to!)Streep sold the scene within the scene, and irony, she was supposed to be doing a terrible job because of her character's drug dependency.Somehow a scene with Meryl Streep in it never drags. Maybe she guides the direction and the editing. Thinking back (this is the first movie of hers I've seen in years) to Sophie's Choice, for example--1982 best actress Oscar and other honors--she hasn't changed much except that she's a little more relaxed, and while her concentration is still total, there is a touch less urgency in her performance. I've heard people complain about her mannerisms, that head to the side so that the corner of the mouth goes up, a little defensive smile, and then the flash of eyes, comes to mind, and some others; but compared with say, Dustin Hoffman or (horrors) John Wayne, she's as pure as Olivier.I liked her timing on the "..And you weren't wearing any underwear" line (talking about the embarrassment of her drunk mother showing her legs at a party in the past).Shirley MacLaine is, if anything, even better here as--dare I say it?--"Debbie Reynolds," one part alcoholic, one part stage mom, and one part frustrated actress jealous of her daughter's youth and talent, all parts overbearing. I recall Shirley MacLaine as a young woman. I can see her in Can-Can (1960) showing off those gorgeous legs (she shows her legs here too, but I cringed along with her daughter). She was pretty, healthy and busting her bodice as a young actress, and I liked her, but she was never more than a popular actress. Then came, Terms of Endearment (1983).Shirley MacLaine is the classic example of the actress who really learned how to act as she got older, not unlike Betty Davis, who also got better as she aged. Shirley MacLaine (Warren Beatty's sister, one recalls) did get an academy award nomination for The Apartment (1960) with Jack Lemmon, but did not win.I liked the hospital scene here at the end, mother and daughter renewing their bonds, Shirley without her wig, and no make-up. You know you've got a serious actress when she will let herself look naturally terrible for the camera!This is a true tinsel town original in which Hollywood self-analyzes in public, to be ranked in the vicinity of Sunset Boulevard (1950) and The Player (1992)--in different ways, of course--for giving us a glimpse of what it's really like to live the dream. (Or is it a nightmare?)

review/text: Mr. Feldman has brought a lot of clear thinking, history, and a legal opinion to the separation of church and state in the US. Like a good legal opinion, much of the book is on prerequisites, i.e. history. Only in the last fifty pages or so does he get to the present and future.It is an interesting problem. We (that's the universal we, as everyone must think like I do) look at Islamic fundamentalists as somewhat crazy. Yet it seems that the American fundamentalists are not too far different in their blowing up of abortion clinics, or Pat Robertson wanting to kill the President of Venezuela (or maybe just kidnap him).It further seems that the more science learns about things, the more that some people reject the scientific evidence in favor of knowing in their own mind that God didn't do it that way.I'm not so sure that this isn't just a current fad. One day the Democrats will decide that they want to get back into power and start putting together candidates that can win. Perhaps then we'll go back to some form of sanity.

review/text: I've been using this cookbook for over 20 years and it is falling apart and stained. I have made most of the recipes in this book and they always come out excellent. Incredible recipes. Try the curried banana balls! Or the Royal lamb curry. Easy to follow recipes, I credit this book for making me a cook. My only advice is to never use as much oil as the recipes call for, use just enough to saute the onions/garlic, etc.

review/text: These guys are simultaneously a rock and roll treasure and a rock and roll tragedy. This is one of the best albums of the era--every song on it is tremendous and instead of being one-hit wonders, S&T; should have dominated the airwaves like Fleetwood Mac or the Eagles.The only thing better than this was the demo that got them their record deal. The demo, which featured these songs played by Loggins & Messina's band and recorded by their production team is so much better than this admittedly hit-bound recording, it's sick. The grooves are slinkier, Townsend doesn't sound so stiff and ready for radio. The whole demo has this organic southern smile on it that is truly amazing. Why Warner's re-recorded it is a mystery. Maybe the guys can get the rights to their demo tracks and release them on CD. Hell, it's only been 30 years. Now that would be something to buy!Still "Smoke" is a tremendous record. None of the later records came close.

review/text: I partially owe my love of hockey to NHL '93 on Sega Genesis, and I have played most hockey games since then. I find this one to deliver the least amount of fun and highest amount of frustration of any that I have played.Here is my laundry list of problems with this game, some that I would consider major and some that I would consider peeves:1. GraphicsThis game looks like N64/PS1 graphics. Games wind up being the dark blobs vs. the light blobs, as far as I can tell.2. AIPlayers skate right past the puck when they're under computer control. The only thing the AI does on defense is collapse everyone in front of the net.3. Player DifferentiationEvery player plays just like every other player. Paul Kariya can hit as hard as Chris Chelios. Adam Foote is as fast as Mike Modano, with turbo, on the breakaway. They all look the same. They all play the same. EA Sports' system of Heroes and Big Hitters sure looks brilliant in comparison.4. CommentatorsThis game licenses elements from ESPN--why do we get Mono and Tone for commentators? They're boring and repetitive. How about Gary Thorne and Clement, Clement, hands of cement? Or Dave Strader and Darren Pang? Barry Melrose's machine-gun laugh before a game? John Buccigross saying "He is clutch, and clutch is everything in life?"Commentary typically sounds like this: "He's going to have to continue to make saves like that if the" (pause) (insert team name here) (pause) "are going to have any chance!"(The worst error: when I won the Stanley Cup, the commentators said, and I quote, "The Stars are one step closer to the Stanley Cup!")5. SoundtrackIf you like the same cheesy organ riffs over and over, this soundtrack is for you!6. OfficiatingThe puck-carrier can get a penalty for hooking. Yeah, right, Sega! And the goalie can sit on an unplayable puck while 20 seconds run off the game clock before it's called "Puck Frozen." Oh, and then there are the random times that the puck is frozen for no reason...7. Shooting/ScoringThis is the real killjoy of the game. It's very easy in NHL 2K3 to have 50 or 60 shots and not score a goal. There are only two shots that can score: skate in on the off-wing and deke the goalie to the inside, and take a slapshot from the faceoff circle. One-timers (the staple of EA Sports) rarely score. Redirections don't score. You can't cherry-pick just outside the crease. If a defenseman takes a slapshot from the point, it's almost always blocked, and never beats the goalie.8. Default SettingsTeam strategy settings default to manual for both player and AI teams. That's right, unless you choose to set the computer team to Automatic strategy changes, it uses the same strategy for the ENTIRE game, regardless of score. Also, the default voice mask for online play is Anonymous, which ranks somewhere between "nails on the chalkboard" and "Gilbert Gottfried" on the annoyance scale.The only advantages that this game has over NHL 2003 is that it is XBox Live enabled, has the concept of a minor-league system, and has some nice along-the-boards gameplay.It's a real shame that this game is as poor as it is. NHL 2K3's "controllability" of what you can do during the game is top-notch. It smartly uses the triggers as modifiers for other buttons to let you have real control over what the players do. The gameplay options are extremely customizable (but they left out the setting for "Fun").All in all, rarely have I played a game that delivers less fun than NHL 2K3.

review/text: I saw this during the eighties when it originally came out and thought it was terrific and scary. However, this movie does not hold up at all. It's not just the technological advancements in special effects that makes this movie so dated, afterall movies like &quot;The Thing&quot; and &quot;The Exorcist&quot; came out before this. A scary movie is scary no matter when it came out. This movie is just silly. The president's fear of nuclear war is treated so brazenly that it doesn't hold up now that the Day After decade is over. The story is so brisk in the extreme nothing is giving time to develop. Only the ideas are presented and not explored. Quaid and Sydow are good but even they can't save this movie. The dialog is very stilted at parts. Christopher Plummer is just silly, not menacing. Tommy Ray isn't scary any more. The snake man looks so rubbery and stupid that I can't believe I was ever scared of it in the first place. They did a terrible job with it. The transformation effects are now laughable. They didn't have to be. Kate Capshaw is awful (she always was; maybe that's one of the reasons you don't see her in much anymore now that she is married to Spielberg). This is just not that strong a movie and time has not been kind to it. I thought it was great when I was 10 but it just isn't scary or fun. Awful music by Maurice Jarre. Not because it is an electronic eighties keyboard soundtrack like Jerry Goldsmith's Runaway. No this is just bad and it sounds bad on this DVD. No themes develop and even the chase music is boring. Very weak. Similar genre movies from the eighties that hold up and you might want to check out instead: Twilight Zone the Movie, Gremlins, Poltergeist, Brainstorm, Fright Night.DVD-This dvd is also not very good either. The picture quality is very crisp most of the time. There is some wavering in some scenes. The special effects unfortuneately don't benefit from all that detail in picture quality. The worst part is the sound. It comes in DTS and Dolby Digital. It is hardly 5.1 like the box advertises. Occasionally you get some weak directional effects. But for I would say 80% of the movie everything is in the center speaker.The best thing about this DVD is the menus. They were a pleasant surprise. The movie and this DVD were not.

review/text: First of all, I'm not a typical Clay Aiken fan. I'm not a teenage girl, or a drooling middle-age woman who thinks Clay's the greatest thing since Bobby Darin. I'm a fortysomething male (and no, I'm not gay) who saw Clay on "American Idol," felt there was something "magical" (in the words of Gladys Knight) about him and became an instant fan. And while "Measure of a Man" may not be a classic CD, or even one for the ages, so to speak, I find it to be one of the most satisfying, and refreshingly honest pieces of music of the year. Twelve songs and not a clinker in the bunch, all exceedingly listenable and unpretentious and and beautifully sung by a young man with incredible vocal pipes and an uncanny sense of what works for himself and his audience.The highlights: First single "Invisible," the title tune, "Touch," and the incredible power ballad "I Survived You," which Clay should have dedicated to the lunk-headed judges who clearly favored last year's head-scratcher-of-a-winner Ruben Studdard, whose entire act consisted of bad Luther Vandross imitations.Lowlights: None, although if I have any complaints with "MOAM" it's that there are one-or-two-too-many sound-alike ballads in the middle of the album and not enough acoustic, quiet moments that truly showcase Clay's vocal mastery. Also, there are too many producers working independently on each song, so the album does come across as overproduced, which is one of the few legitimate critical complaints against this album.Regardless, this is a fine debut project from a young man who is going to be around a lot longer than his air-brained critics like to think. Yes, it would be nice if Clay displayed more "edge" in future projects, but there's something to be said about an artist who isn't afraid to present a product that appeals to those of us who would rather listen to anything other than critical darlings like Outkast and gutter rappers like 50 Cent.Sorry, critics. Clay Aiken's the real deal. Now deal with it.

This means that devices that read this information cannot use or display the CD names or track names. So, an iTunes won't read any CD names or track names, nor will any CD player that can show CD names or track names.2.

review/text: I don't get to say this very often, but the Prince Caspian movie was better than the novel.When I read through the Narnia series a few months ago, I had the thought that for the books to be made into good films, the Disney writers were going to have to add some scenes, to fill in the blanks where C.S. Lewis' high creativity fell short.This film does a great job filling in the blanks. 4 or 5 key scenes were added to the film rather seemlessly, and moviegoers who haven't read the books in a long while won't even realize which scenes are new to the story. I had a hard enough time distinguishing, and I just read the novels.All that said, the movie is a good time...humorous, action-packed, tense, and creative. More than anything, the film paints an accurate picture of Lucy's faith journey with Aslan and how her siblings learn with her.Fun times.--- Reviewed by Jonathan Stephens

review/text: The plot of the book was very interesting and I think that it holds a special appeal for aspiring authors. However, parts of the book are extremely drawn out, and Wolfe feels the need to tell the reader every small detail about the character's life, without seeming to care whether it is of any significance to the reader. So although the plot is good and the character's well-developed, it is not fast-moving and I think that many people will become bored and restless through certain parts. However, if they keep reading it soon picks up again, and I feel that the book is worth reading even though it has this negative aspect about it.Another good thing about the book is that it does an excellent job of capturing the American spirit that persisted at the time it was written. During the novel the Great Depression takes place, as well as the beginning of World War II. The novel shows the social decay of this era and emptiness which envades American citizens' hearts when they realize that all the money they put so much worth in is nothingness now. If for nothing else one should read this book for an accurate picture of the time period in American history.Be aware of a lot of sexism and rascism throughout this novel, which shows the time period it was written in and hopefully shows us how far we have come- if not in reality, at least in the art of writing. I recommend this book for its plot and its setting, and if you like to read a book such as this and you don't only look for an on-the-edge-of-your-seat success story (and you can resist taking offense to some ugly comments), and especially if you are looking for a book that represents a time and a place very accurately, I think you will really like this book. It definitely has a great literary value and has stood the test of time in the hearts of many readers and lovers of literature.

review/text: Look, forget any praises of the book you have heard because it "has strong female characters" or because it's not "in-your-face Christian apologism." There are lots of things to praise about this book, but those two praises are entirely misplaced.For one thing, as long as we're discussing Lewis's improved!female characters - so far as I'm concerned, Orual is Lewis's typical example of any soul that is still prideful, in all of its grubbly and idiotic self-will (but she can use a sword well, so that will be enough for some). Psyche is someone who has conquered that self-will, but most would see her as a goody two-shoes saint. Asnit is a wife and widow - and that's about all. Redival is a typical Lewisian villain, almost absurdly sneaky and two-faced, with the added femmy element of being boy-crazy. And a magnificent fighting queen farther north is mentioned - once. I'm not saying I have anything against it on these grounds. But it's absurd to come to "Till We Have Faces" looking for a feminist book.As for the idea that this book has less overt Christianity for the non-Christian reader to swallow - well, superficially, the gods in this book are all pagan. But there are large whacks of this book I imagine I would have found very boring before my conversion - boring, melodramatic, and vague. In fact, Christian point of view aside, the two conversations between Orual and Psyche in the Shadowbrute's valley could have used an editor's red pen. The views of the Fox and Bardia (who are both good, loving men nevertheless) are examples of the ways believers can be fuddled and led astray. And towards the very end Orual is using blatantly Christian verbage: "I know now, Lord, why you utter no answer. You are yourself the answer. Before your face questions die away. What other answer would suffice?"Of course, anyone could read it, and many enjoy it. For example, the "worldly" parts of the book are very interesting from any viewpoint - life under the temperamental petty king (who, seemingly, would have found in Henry VIII a kindred spirit), the purchase of the Greek captive Fox, who becomes the girls' tutor, the skirmishes between the King and the Priest of Ungit, veiled Orual learning to fence and challenging a king in combat (with Fox saying that its "foolish and, what's more, unseemly"!), and the details of the Queen's busy and shrewd reign. And we've all been trained to appreciate Greek pagan aesthetics, so that's another element to the book anyone will like - Lewis is rich (perhaps overrich) and pretty in his symbols and pictures and visions for Orual.But this is a morality to Orual's eventual, mature judgment of herself that not everyone is going to share. For example, not everyone would have thought it shameful to admit that she (at one point!) appreciated and even encouraged Prince Trunia's flirtacious banter. For those who do, of course, it's a rich dimension to the book.The details of life in Glome are well-envisioned and enjoyable.So why did I give this three stars? I love Lewis's nonfiction works, but I've yet to read one of his fictional ones that didn't leave something to be desired (mind, I haven't yet read Perelandra). Perhaps because he is sometimes trying to be too allegorical, his characterizations usually suffer. Several in "Till We Have Faces" are maddeningly flat. This is the best fictional work of Lewis's I've ever read. But it's far from the best fictional work I've ever read.

review/text: Like other novels by Thomas Hardy, this is a beautiful and densely written work; I have read several of his other novels, but it is the character of Tess that sticks most in my mind. This is a tragic story, make no mistake, and as such it left a deep impression upon me. Numerous scenes and details linger in my memory, due to Hardy's rich prose style - the terrible death of the Durbeyfield horse; the texture of Tess's cheek, unwillingly yielded for Alec to kiss (as "damp and smoothly chill as the skin on the mushrooms in the fields around"); Tess's humane execution of mutilated pheasants, preyed upon by careless hunters. I could go on...but then half of the pleasure of reading is a sense of discovery, so I shall end there.Hardy's usual pastoral idyll is present here (in the form of Talbothays and eloquent descriptions of the bounties of spring), but this is thrown into powerful contrast by the increasingly bleak events that overtake the hopeless Tess as she progresses.I recommend it for any reader willing to try 19th century novels, and particularly fans of Eliot - Hardy was of a proto-feminist persuasion, like Eliot, but I think he writes with even more emotional power. It is interesting to observe that modern male writers seem relatively unconcerned with creating such singularly memorable female characters, although Hardy was admittedly an oddity of his era.If you have struggled to get beyond the first few chapters - as I initially did - I found that a total-immersion policy helped; the intensity of the denoument means that this is a book best read over a short time. I grew so attached to the characters and settings of the novel that I felt lost when I finished reading it.If you have read this and relished Hardy's fatalistic approach as much as I did, then Jude the Obscure is definately worth reading.

We were looking for something to put under our PD170 and stumbled upon this beauty.The construction quality is solid and as a unit the tripod is stable. The fluid head panning is just about as good I could expect. Smooth and steady. The tripod shoe is nice and has a cork pad to protect the bottom of your camera.The tripod would be a good buy for just its basic features, but what sets it apart is the LANC remote control built into the handle. Its great. LANC (or Control-L) compatable cameras are made by Sony (this is a Sony product) and Canon and some others.On the handle you have a On/Standy switch, a Record button, a Photo button, and a Zoom rocker. For the stuff we've done so far its super. I can keep my hands on the handle get the shots I want.The remote control makes the makes using the camcorder on the tripod a slick experience.The only thing that would make this a better deal is if they added a Focus Control to the remote. As far as usage - the only other issue is it took a while to get a feel for how much to tighten the tilt knob to lock it down - i didn't want to over-torque it and break something and didn't want the camera slowly moving either - but once you get the feel its fine.This tripod is a good buy. But don't feel like you have to run out and get one. We like being the only cool and geeky ones.

review/text: This is a wonderful genre bending book...part mystery, part history. Written by Scotswoman Elizabeth MacIntosh, who wrote under the pen name Josephine Tey, it was first published in 1951. It is tragic that the author died in 1952 and was never to know the pleasure that this book would bring to generations of readers and that the Mystery Writers of America would ultimately rank it fourth among the one hundred best mysteries ever written.The title of the book is derived from a historical source, as it is attributable to Sir Francis Bacon, "For truth is rightly named after the daughter of time, and not of authority." The book itself is not a traditional mystery but rather an application of deductive reasoning to an actual historical event. The event in question is the murder of the princes in the tower, sons of King Edward IV, allegedly by their uncle, Richard III, who eventually usurped the English throne after the death of his brother. It has been widely held that Richard III did, indeed, murder the two young princes, his nephews, in order to secure his claim to the throne.The reader is introduced to Scotland Yard Inspector Alan Grant, who is hospitalized and recovering from injuries sustained in the line of duty. While convalescing, he becomes intrigued by a picture of a portrait of Richard III, a likeness with which he is unfamiliar. Grant is puzzled that someone with such a sensitive face could have been such a monster as to murder his two nephews in cold blood. So, our intrepid Inspector decides that he will reconsider the evidence upon which such a dastardly assumption has been based. With the help of an American researcher doing the necessary legwork, Grant compiles enough archival historical fact that incrementally helps him formulate a new theory as to who actually may have murdered the princes in the tower.This analysis and reformulation is done as though it were being argued to a jury. Indeed, so persuasive is Inspector Grant through the application of some insightful deductive reasoning and clever dialogue that the reader comes away thinking that Grant has solved one of the most intriguing historical mysteries of all time. This is certainly an unusual book conceptually but one that succeeds brilliantly. It should appeal to those readers who enjoy having a mystery unraveled, as well as to those who harbor a love of English history.Derek Jacobi gives a lively and spirited reading. He positively shines when reading the role of Detective Grant and gives a most persuasive characterization. It almost more a performance than a reading. The only slight problem is that when incorporating the role of the American researcher into the reading, his American accent falters a bit. Despite this small issue, however, his reading of this brilliant work is one of the most engaging that I have ever heard in an audio book. Bravo!

He's tried to play both sides of the fence on his last 2 records...mainstream and alt-country, and it's getting old. Be one or the other, and it seems he's leaning more on the mainstream side on this new album, which I don't like. I HATE mainstream country, there's no edge, no real ROCK & ROLL in it, and it's tailormade for radio, and I can't stand mainstream country radio. On this record, it seems the label is trying to mold Dierks into being all mainstream. No way man, he blew it this time. He doesn't have enough of an inner hunger or independent streak. If anything, one new country record out this week that blows this one away is Vince Gill's new 4CD extravaganza of 43 NEW SONGS!!! Each disc focuses on a distinct style: catchy rock, southern soul/blues, traditional country, and acoustic/bluegrass. Vince wrote or co-wrote all the songs, plays lead guitar on all of them, co-produced it all, and he doesn't give a damn about having a hit single, ie it's not COMMERCIAL, and he's true to his art and his strengths, which is more important and makes Vince kind of alternative...Dierks should follow this path and defy what his label wants...independent alternative artistry is more important than hit singles, which are actually detrimental to any career, as they put artists into a box. Dierks CAN break the mold and escape this mentality, while there's still time...we'll see...nice packaging on the limited edition though...

review/text: &quot;Run, Lola, Run,&quot; starring Franka Potente as the flaming redhead Lola, is guaranteed classic cult film status for years to come. Lola lights up the screen in this German film which features creative cinematography and near-perfect editing, combining cinema verit&eacute; and animation. Tom Tykwer shows brilliance as the film's director; his use of close-ups of these not-perfect faces is exceptional. &quot;Lola&quot; is a film that one can enjoy watching over and over again, so it is a worthwhile addition to a DVD collection. As someone who primarily enjoys classical music and opera, I was thrilled by the techno-trance music of the film's soundtrack. I recommend that viewers watch this film in the German version, with the English subtitles, because it is very easy to understand the film this way and adds to its authenticity. And it only gets better. The movie is told in three segments, each with different aspects and outcomes. Overall, this is definitely one of those films that gets better each time you watch it, a totally original, undiscovered treasure.

Instead of "big stars," it has great actors, chief among them being Christian Bale as Batman.Whereas Tim Burton's films seemed obsessed with the way the films looked, Nolan cares more about plot, script, performances, and other concepts long since abandoned by Hollywood.Comparisons to Joel Schumacher's Batman films aren't necessary, as they were horrible.Go see this film.

review/text: If you love this repertoire (early C20 english music/cello) you can't go too far wrong with this lovely disc. The Ireland is quite well known, and deservedly, but the Moeran and Rubbra less well known. The neglect is undeserved, - the Rubbra is taut and cogent (as you'd expect) and the Moeran is intimate and rhapsodic (as you'd expect).It (the Moeran) was written for Peers Coetmore, then the composer's fiance, later his wife and dedicatee of Moeran's absolutely superb cello concerto (her performance on an old Lyrita LP was one othe treasures of my vinyl collection). Wallfisch is a champion of english cello music, usually on Chandos and sometimes on Naxos, and can be relied upon for at least fine playing, sometimes inspired (as on his Finzi recording for Chandos).This isn't quite at the Finzi concerto level, and possibly reflects a little less familiarity with the pieces(??) but is certainly good, as is the sympathetic playing of john York. Nor is the recording quite at the level of some of Chandos' cello recordings, although its certainly good.For those reasons and because the sonatas, whilst lovely, are slightly-less-than-top drawer compared to the very best works of all three composers, I've gone for a curmudgeonly (and possibly mean) four stars rather than five for a disc of interest, distinction and reward. Recommended.

review/text: Kris Kristofferson's voice has sometimes been compared to a "croaking" frog. So, it is fitting that some of the best singers and Kris's friends should pay tribute to Kris and his 70th birthday by "breathing new life into his tunes"."Kristofferson was never much for easy. For most of his life, he craved both desperation and accomplishment. Or maybe he craved the kind of accomplishment that can only spring from desperation. Anyway, he threw himself into worlds of bruised-hearted trouble, of excess and alcohol and worry and peril. That everything all worked out in the end is one measure of the man. "All alone all the way on your own/ Who's to say that you've thrown it away for a song?" he once sang. Well, plenty of people said that about him." an interviewer said of him.This CD is everything The Legend would want; The producers selected Kristofferson's best songs and chose some major singers to interpret them. Willie Nelson, Roseanne Cash, Emmylou Harris and Rodney Crowell are so well known and would ensure the quality of this CD. But, it is the lesser knowns that enliven this CD- just wait til you hear, BK.Kris Kristofferson opens "The Pilgrim: A Celebration of Kris Kristofferson with an old intro to "The Pilgrim", which blends into the Emmylou Harris and friends' renditionWillie Nelson's interpretation of the spiritual song "The Legend "is the best there is.Emmylou Harris starts the CD off with her sweet rendition of "The Palm: Cheaper 33"".Roseanne Cash gives a soulful version "Lovin Him Was Easier".Rodney Crowell's "Come Sundown" is first rate.It is the other singers, who are lesser known who are standouts.Shooter Jennings sings "The Silver Tongued Devil" with flair.Randy Scruggs plays an instrumental of "Smile At Me Again".Todd Snider gives a gospel interpretation of those who find fault with friends in need of understanding in "Maybe You Heard".Marshall Chapman sings "Jesus Was A Capricorn" with a smile in her heart.Patty Griffin and Charanga Cakewalk take the political "Sandinista" and turn it into a personal plea for freedom.Shawn Camp's "Why Me" would make even an agnostic a true believer.Gretchen Wilson portrays life the day after with a mournful sound on "Sunday Morning Comin' Down."Russell Crowe is the biggest surprise. He tells the story of a man preoccupied with his work and material goods who loses it all when he discovers his wife has been unfaithful on "Darby's Castle". Crowe lets the tension build by singing the lyrics clear and straight and letting the words do the work.Brian McKnight sings a soulful version of "Me and Bobby McGee" that shows the sadness of this marvelous song.Bruce Robison and Kelly Willis, husband and wife, sing "Help Me Make it Through the Night." They sing the song of seduction with a country feel.Kris Kristofferson ends the CD with "Please Don't Tell Me How The Story Ends". This song functions well as a conclusion and also serves as pleasant reminder of the man behind the music.This is a CD to remember and to play as a reminder of the marvelous talented song writer, Kris Kristofferson. Highly Recommended. prisrob 07-11-06

review/text: Mere Christianity by C.S Lewis was derived from three radio lectures given by the author during the Second World War. Lewis is a well-known mid-twentieth century writer with popular works in a variety of genres; religious fiction, children's fiction, science fiction as well as religion/philosophy.Mere Christianity remains, probably, the most significant twentieth century Christian apologetic text. Lewis employs what is known as the classic approach to apologetics - starting with a general argument for the existence of God then moving on to make the specific case Christianity. Contrary to an earlier reviewer - this is a general introduction aim at the lay reader. Although all readers can find it helpful, it is not aimed at "intellectuals". Readers seeking more significant philosophical argumentation on these types of issues may want to look at the likes of Plantinga, Craig, Moreland etc.One small criticism of the book is the last chapter - it has 1940's speculative science fiction feel. Lewis' interest in science fiction; coupled with the progressive view of evolution popular among thinkers at the time makes it feel dated and a bit out of place for an introductory text.Overall, Mere Christianity is a classic (The audio version is also tremendous). I highly recommend it as a starting point for anyone interested in Christian apologetics. Readers that enjoy this may also like The Screwtape Letters and the Great Divorce also from Lewis.

review/text: I doubt I shall ever come across a better writer of history or Science Fiction in this lifetime.Asimov was a great student of history, psychology, and science. Unlike most students and academics, though, Asimov also was a superb writer in each area and could distill the essence of his knowledge into entertaining non-fiction or fiction. Read his books regarding history of civilization or about Black Holes or about religion and I'm sure you will appreciate his knowledge about such diverse topics and his ability to keep you awake at night reading!I'm not saying you will agree with his every point - only that you will be exposed to a well-articulated discussion.In the Foundation series, it is clear Asimov has combined history and psychology to an extraordinary degree. The question is, was this young man of Russian birth writing of Russia's future or was he merely writing of England's past?You see, a great civilization has encompassed all the known world. Then, inevitably, it will begin a collapse. As in other empires, collapse begins in part due to the burdensome administrative hub (Moscow, Washington DC or London?), combined with a recession at a time when the outcast and downtrodden are fed up with unemployment and unfulfilled promises of a better future (Eastern Europe or the inner cities of America or Britain). This dilemma is further exacerbated by revolutionaries and terrorists in the hinterlands.Enter Mr. Seldon. Clearly he is based on the alter ego of Asimov himself, for the man is a student of mathematics, psychology, religion and history, as well as of politics.I could write a book to dissect the brilliance of the writing and the lessons for all leaders, but will simply say that Foundation, Foundation & Empire, and Second Foundation make up my favorite all-time trilogy. No knock against Lord of the Rings intended. LOTR is terrific but not quite as good.

review/text: Ray Bradbury has taken an issue so overlooked even today, to have written something about the topic of censorship in the 1950s was quite a daring act. Ray Bradbury did it well enough, and with his ficticious novel Fahrenheit 451 he explores the horrible underbelly of education and society, and forces the reader to re-examine the values of our society.In the novel, the main character (protaganist) Guy Montag, is a fireman, but not what you'd expect, his job is to burn books and the houses that contain them, but then he meets a young woman named Clarisse who teaches him the wonderful truth of books, and a place where imagination and thinking are praised. Montag become obsessive with the idea of obtaining books, knowing that they must be wonderful treasures, so great, that people would give up their lives for them.Soon, like most things in life Clarisse fades away, but so does the thin strand that was Montag's grip on life. He seems to spin out of control, the books that he once destroyed now seemed to be destroying him, becoming his every obsession. Montag finds himself becoming afraid of everyone and everything, and he feels alone, unable to be helped.Fahrenheit 451 is a fabulous book dealing with an issue that still badgers people today even in the 21st century: censorship. This book takes an immediate look at the history of censorship, and sets forth startling revelations as to what will become of mankind if we take away the creative process, the independent, thinking spirit of man and gives a warning that must not be ignored. Fahrenheit 451 is an absolutely essential read.

review/text: The blurb on the dust jacket says: &quot;a provocative and important book that will profoundly change our understanding both of Islamist politics and the way America is perceived in the world.&quot;This is probably true. The book presents a view of the Muslim world that is quite different from others such as Huntington's &quot;Clash of Civilizations&quot; which holds that the next big struggles between Muslims and the Christians will be the world's next big battlefield based on cultural differences. Mamdani sees the Muslim's current actions as an extension of the Cold War. (He grew up in Africa, among who's nations the US and the Soviet Union fought the war.) That he is probably right does not alter Huntington's view in my mind.I'd also like to see a chapter, maybe two, on the impact of oil on the crisis. Would 9/11 have happened if Iraq's invasion of Kuwait hadn't happened right over the oil we need to import?I further question some of his historical aspects. Mohammed was both a religious and military leader. (He was pretty good until he came up against one of the Greats - Genghis Kahn.) There seems to be to me more of an emphasis on uniting the two in the current Muslim thinking.I really like his closing statement: &quot;To win the fight against terrorism requires accepting that the world has changed, ... that to occupy foreig places will be expensive, in lives and money. America cannot occupy the world. It has to live in it.

review/text: One of the misconceptions that people who have not read this book apparently have is that the Buckle family is "reaping what it's sown" by having gotten their farm through illegitimate means (ie. colonialism). This is a very crass attitude grounded in both ignorance and racism.In fact the Buckle family purchased their farm AFTER Zimbabwean independence with the explicit written promise from Mugabe's government that the land would not be targeted for redistribution. The real story here is how a demagogue like Mugabe, who manufactures racial hatred for his own political gain, can be so disrespectful of the very principles that he espoused to obtain power in the first place.For those who think that the land reform issue is a simple matter of taking from the rich and giving to the poor, it may be quite a shock to learn that the only ones benefiting so far from newly acquired farmland are Mugabe's wealthy political cronies. Everyone else is on the verge of starvation due to the inevitable collapse of the economic infrastructure following the demise of the rule of law.The rest of the world stood by and watched it happen. Perhaps someday we'll realize that it's far more humanitarian and cost-efficient to prevent famines before they occur.

As English is my native tongue, and I had studied French/Japanese at school, I was looking for an easy book that would teach me the hindi alphabet and provide me with some easily referenceable vocabulary. Whilst this book provides some assistance on both, I didn't find the layout to be very useful. I would have also preferred more attention on how to write the characters.I'd still recommend this book, but a little more visual assistance (the book is a bit dry, as it is predominantly textual) would have enhanced my learning speed, as well as more romanization of hindi words, especially for beginners such as myself.

review/text: The Rabbi's Cat is a wonderful book. I heard the author speak on NPR and got the book. The book is in the form of a comic strip, each box lovingly illustrated by the author. The pictures are wonderful, particularly of the cat. They are a joy to behold.Even better are the stories, anecdotes taken from the lives of the Jews in North Africa in the thirties. The stories are both very sad and hysterically funny. The cat has a sardonic turn of phrase that had me in stitches. Through the difficult medium of comics, the author has managed to capture the atmosphere of the time and place. Much of the book is given to musings about life, philosophy, love, God and so on. If you like a good discussion, you'll enjoy this book.Although the books can be enjoyed by non-Jews, I think if you don't know the basics of Judaism, you'll be missing the most vital part of the book. Of course, the book is so appropriate for the cat lover. The author clearly understands cats perfectly.

review/text: I think that The Cannabis Grow Bible: the definitive guide to growing marijuana for recreational and medical use by Greg Green is probably the most valid and important marijuana cultivation guide to hit the shelves, ever. The reason why I highly recommended this book to growers is because of the sheer volume of factual cultivation information as opposed to growing myths, stoner ramblings and old information.A book like this one really depends on how well it can be put into practice and I will stop short from calling this book the ultimate guide because I want to see more from this writer. If you have never tried to grow marijuana before or have had bad results then use this book to get you there from start to finish in no time. This is the one thing that really stands out about this book. It gets you there very quickly and with good results. Growers who are looking for a more experienced grow book should not miss this opportunity to turn a trick at adding a few pounds to their grow room by attempting some of the advanced techniques featured here. This is the high yielder surprise book that I got as an early Christmas present.[There is a breeding chapter which sets a new standards for books of this type. It explains how to stabilize a line of genetics using breeding techniques. I can not understate the important value of this grow book to me.]

Then FlatOut is the game for you. This game may not be a realistic racing simulator, may not have the best GUI for menus (can be managed with wheel and keyboard use.

This game is great after those long commutes, just load it up, start a race, turn around and crash headlong into everything in sight, thinking it was that guy that was tailgating you, or that dead ass that wouldn't get out of the way. SMASH, CRASH, or get the cheat for the ejector seat and have fun throwing the dummy for distance or altitude records.

There all there in one form or another. In all, great fun, and certainly worth the money.

review/text: I absolutely couldn't stand this book!I'm not understanding how it's sexy for a woman to give up her friends and life for a guy who wishes to control her completely. The Don was a jerk. Nicoletta is an awesome heroine in the beginning, but turns into a submissive wifey thing by the end. It's a sad thing when a woman, to paraphrase an actually part of Nicoletta's thoughts, "leaves her old life behind because he'll never like it, and because she just HAS to". Eeeeew.I loved the Dark series, and constantly used to stalk the bookstore waiting for the next one. This one was the beginning of the end of my love for Ms. Feehan's work. I bought it to tide me over from one Dark book to the next, and it made me so angry that I wrote the author and got into a big argument over the book!Please, please, please...read something in the Dark series, or Emma Holly's Upyr series.

review/text: The last line of my review comes first:If you do not find church humor and church-esque situations (including a lot of parodying of church ideology and customs) funny, either due to inexposure (like me) or too much exposure (fundamentalism), this book is NOT for you.And now the review:I love Terry Pratchett - he is my favorite author of all time. And I picked up this book hoping it would become one of my favorites.The fact is, I didn't find much in this book that was funny.This novel moves along at a snail's pace, in terms of the plot and the humor. The chief reason for my disillusionment is that Pratchett includes a LOT of church analogies into the novel. The characters are all church characters. And the god is not so godly. Over half of this book came across as a particularly long and pointless conversation between a dullard and his favorite stuffed animal.Overall, I wish I'd had a review that had warned me thusly:(last line of the review)

review/text: I remember having read this book in high school. I immediately fell in love with Hardy. (I was also fond of Hardy Boys at that time, so in my opinion the name Hardy acquired a special significance.) Unfortunately, though, I never liked another book by him quite so much. I've read Tess of the d'Urbvilles, Under the Greenwood Tree, Far from the Madding Crowd(which was perhaps his second best novel, as others here have affirmed), and perhaps a few others. It is strange, or perhaps significant that I remember the exact circumstance when I was reading this book. It must have been about ten in the night. I had cleared my study desk, and unlike my common practice of lying on my stomach on my bed to enjoy a book into the night, I sat down on the straight-backed chair at the desk to read it. Very soon, I was overwhelmed by the narrative of Mr. Hardy. My father came in to see what I was up to, saw the tears streaming down my face as I turned the pages of my book, and quietly went away. I have never before owned any story books- my parents told me to read out of libraries. But now I am 22, and have started earning some money of my own, and I'm going to start a little collection of my most beloved books, to pass on to my children, perhaps? And this is among my very best.

review/text: Homesickness is the second novel I've read by Bail. It reads well though not as well as 'Eucalyptus'. From my own limited experience in traveling, 'Homesickness' does an excellent job of capturing the stereotypical tourist comparing every country to their own, usually in a less than flattering manner, sending home postcards with generic statements, and trying to go native. The museums the characters of the novel visit are strange, bordering on plain weird. From the (literal) Institution of Marriage to a corrugated metal museum, Bail leads us through each one with subtle humor. His sketch of each destination is done well, especially New York City and Russia. While this is an interesting novel, though the average reader might get lost by references to various aspects of Australia culture, I liked his more recent novel, 'Eucalyptus'. I think readers who travel a lot will find much of this novel amusing and dead on. A few of the sentence structures are strange such as missing commas or the syntax in unusual order that I had to reread a second time to understand. Just before Bail dumps the Australian tourists on their last trip to Russia, he provides his own experiences in Russia, which seemed like he wanted to include this extra material for the heck of it.

review/text: Live At Woodstock(1969).The Jimi Hendrix Experience's Live Performance at 1969's Woodstock.After the legendary previous performances at 1969's Woodstock, which included bands like Sly, the Family Stone, The Who, Santana, Joe Cocker, and the newly minted Crosby, Stills, and Nash, at 9 'O Clock on August 18th, 1969, the Jimi Hendrix Experience played Woodstock's most memorable performance, and one of the greatest of all-time. Featuring the virtuoso guitar talents of Jimi Hendrix, often hailed as the best guitarist ever, amidst bad weather and rowdy crowds the Jimi Hendrix experience played their heart out for nearly 2 and a half hours, and thankfully that concert was taped, and released for Hendrix fan's enjoyment. Below you will see how The Jimi Hendrix Experience's legendary performance at Woodstock turned out..Track Selection-Being new to Hendrix, I was taken on an unexpected but ultimately rewarding ride, as other than Rock N Roll classics 'Foxey Lady', 'Purple Haze' and 'Hey Joe', all the rest of these tracks were new to me. Songs such as 'Hear My Train A Comin', 'Spanish Castle Magic', 'Jam Back At The House', and 'Voodoo Child(Slight Return)' are basically examples of Hendrix's Guitar Mastery, his blistering solos encapsulating the echoes of time and talent to show he was surely a guitar god. 'Izzabella', 'Red House', 'Lover Man', and 'Villanova Junction' are all bluesy Hard Rockers that showcase magnificent musicianship, and could easily have been hits. 'Foxey Lady', 'Purple Haze', 'Hey Joe', and the minor hit 'Fire' are all thankfully included here to showcase Hendrix's biggest hits, but I wish he would have played more. Overall I think the Track Selection is excellent, and couldn't have asked for it to be any better! 5/5Sound Quality-For a bootleg of a concert in 1969, Jimi Hendrix Experience's performance sounds outstanding! The guitar solos and riffs blare out the speakers as if you were right there in the muddy crowd at Woodstock, Hendrix's vocals are clean, crisp, and easy to hear, and the bass and drums are clearly there and are easily hearable among the more obvious guitar. Surprisingly, some of the best Sound Quality I've ever heard from a live performance! 5/5Band Performance-What more can I say? Jimi Hendrix is in peak form here, his blistering solos and bluesy riffs, unknown at the time still retain their unmistakeable glory over 35 years later, and the backup band, which includes the bass and drums, dishes out a legendary performance alongside Hendrix. Basically, the Band Performance is flawless, perfect, OUTSTANDING! 5/5Crowd Interaction-The Jimi Hendrix Experience's concert at Woodstock boasts quite a lot of Crowd Interaction, as Hendrix usually gives a few words after every song, joking and informing throughout, and the crowd shouts often to Hendrix to 'TURN IT UP!', and it all makes for a very interesting experience!Overall, The Jimi Hendrix Experience's performance at Woodstock is unmistakenly legendary, classic and brilliant in every way, and now stands as one of my favorite Live recordings. Since I was so impressed with this, I expect to pick up many more Hendrix albums in the next few visits to the CD store!HIGHLY RECOMMENED TO FANS OF HENDRIX, ROCK IN GENERAL, BLUES, AND ANYBODY WHO ENJOYS LIVE RECORDINGS! SIMPLY EPIC, PHENOMENOL, BEAUTIFUL, AND DEFINITELY LOUD!Also Recommended-Jimi Hendrix Experience- Jimi Hendrix ExperienceDisraeli Gears- CreamExperience Hendrix- Jimi HendrixThanks For Reading!

review/text: The Witch of Blackbird Pond was a very different book. I just don't think it was my kind of book.I guess, it was okay but it was not wonderful. I guess if you're into olden times, witch hunts, arguments, and "romance" I guess it would be fine, but it wasn't my favorite book.I'll just kinda give you a brief telling of what the book is about.It starts out that a girl named Kit is sailing from Barbados which is in the West Indies and is headed to stay with her Aunt and her family in Wethersfield, Connecticut. Then she just is really outof place. She has different customs and just doesn't fit in. Her uncle isn't glad she's there and neither are other important people in the township. It's kinda just a lot of mishaps and bad things happen to Kit. Then she befriends a "witch". It's just aboutr her I guess gaining trust and her beginning to fit in.The end was just kinda like "blah". It's just kinda like Kit falls of the face of the earth, although wshe does live "happily ever after". As most books do unless they're horrors.I think that i8f you just wanted to relax it wasn't a good book to read because you had to thyink about what you were reading. But I guess if you're uptight and like it in books where it says 'tis all the time and thee I guess TWOULD (he he he) be good for you. But if you want to go to sleep you could read it. It could be a good bedtime story.If you like the old New England Colony pompousness and stuffiness I think you'd enjoy this book. I think also if you like to hear about a character struggling through life and pretty much being tortured you'd very much enjoy it.

That's the whole point to this CD, it's a retro 80s sound that harkens back to a more innocent time of electronic music when it was wasn't called 'electronica' but rather 'techno'.I got into this CD after seeing the video to '(hey you)what's that sound'. picture a parachute pant, Michael Jackson leather jacket wearing Jacques be-boping his way through the streets of NYC carrying one of those keyboard guitar things followed by a group of 80s fashion disaster clad people (we're talking leg warmers, sweatsuits, terry cloth headbands and that god awful color combination of heather grey and pink)culminating with a breakdance contest and you pretty much get the feeling of this CD.It's cheese but it's good cheese and much fun to listen to. If nothing else buy this CD for the excellent song 'sometimes'. It's a dead ringer for soft cell and if you didn't know that it was les rhythmes you definitely would think that it was soft cell even down to the male vocalist who sounds remarkably like mark almond (although i don't think it's him).Definitely my favorite track that has been set on 'repeat' on my stereo.Buy this only if you can look back on 80s music fondly. If you hate the 80s and everything about it, then steer clear of this release.

review/text: All novels of Vatican misdeeds follow a tried and true cast of characters, and formula. The good Pope v. the bad Secretary of State; the Pope's confidant - a good priest on the verge of loosing his faith; the conflicted journalist, in this case doing double-duty as the romantic interest (a knock-out, as usual;) and the well placed allies and adversaries of the above, doing battle for the heart and soul of a Church steeped in mystery and locked in crisis - "The Third Secret," is no different.The book's opening chapter, a re-telling of the Blessed Virgin's appearances at Fatima is so poorly written (third grade level,) I almost gave the book a toss, but as a true fan of the genre I decided to persevere. I'm glad I did, because Mr. Berry has constructed a page-turner.Though the characters are stock, Mr. Berry has filled them out enough beyond clich&eacute; to make them interesting. If they aren't three dimensional, they are at least 2 dimensional - good enough for a pot-boiler. The villains aren't completely villainous; and the good guys suffer enough turmoil and doubt to ground them.Mr. Berry is well steeped in the inner workings of the Vatican, and gives new twists to the life of the Curia, the politics of the Church's princes, and the mechanics of papal ascension.The plot takes some interesting turns as it revolves around the unveiling of a hitherto missing portion of the third secret of Fatima, hence the title. The secret has caused Pope's to tremble, and if revealed will shake the Church to its foundations. Without giving anything away, suffice it to say the Virgin Lady anticipated today's culture wars, and decided to side with the ultra-left wing of Catholicism. The message turns out to be even more laughable than the jokes that it has inspired through the years, and unfortunately for the novel, suspension of disbelief goes right out the window as soon as the secret is revealed. A pity, because I thought Mr. Berry was on to something bigger than a wish-list of ultra-liberal fantasies."The Third Secret," is a good beach, or airplane read - perfect for the summer - a cut above "Angels and Demons," though most everything is; but, because of its d&eacute;nouement, as unsuccessful as any other title in the genre.

The characters all had a fresh start in season 4 after most of Agrestic burned down. There are some really funny subplots and big surprises along the way. Many times I found myself wondering what the hell Nancy was doing and how could this possibly turn out okay for her in the end? But that only added to the suspense and my enjoyment. My only true criticism was that Conrad and his family were not accounted for. I hope they make a comeback sometime in the future to stir things up!

review/text: This book is a fine introduction to how economic theory can dictate policies that promote the economic well being of society. The focus of the book is "The Law of Unintended Consequences", and the author brings in countless examples of how well meaning policies, such as price ceilings, rent control, etc have led to disastrous results.In giving it 4 stars instead of 5, I'd like to point out some concerns.1) The book, while a classic, is somewhat dated. The ideas are still pertinent, but many examples are not as relevant today.2) I'm afraid that reading Naked Economics first spoiled me a bit. This book lacked the humor and pep that kept me engrossed in the former.3) Most importantly, the book is strictly about economics, and is too simplistic in some ways. It fails to incorporate the complex real world political dynamics that determine policy. Today, most congressmen are sold on the benefits of free trade. But the barriers to economic growth are more nuanced in the real world.Some will argue that this was not the focus of the book, and they are correct. Still, I fear that a reader will latch onto Hazlitt's ideas as a panacea, and fail to appreciate that in a world where "Keeping up with the Joneses" is as important, if not more important, than how much wealth one has, that policy decisions are more complex that the author would have us believe.

review/text: First off let me say that I have no ax to grind in reviewing this book because my family is Lutheran, and I married a Methodist girl, who is now Lutheran. The book was brought to my attention by my wife who has many Catholic friends who she said were very upset by this book. So I took it upon myself to objectively read the book to see for myself what all the controversy was all about.When I read Boettner's book (Yes I did read the entire book, all 466 pages of it) I found so many flaws, made up dates, councils that did NOT take place, and unsubstantiated claims just in the first few chapters, that I HAD to completely finish the book just to see for myself how much of a bigoted author this Loraine Boettner is, and WHY he would write such a book.In the end Boettner never tells the reader WHY he wrote this book, but if I were a Psychologist of a Psychiatrist I would come to the conclusion that here is a man (Boettner) who is extremely jealous of the Roman Catholic Church, and has such a visceral hatred of the Catholic Church that his religiously demented personality demanded that he put down in writing what was in his mind.When Boettner wrote this book it was published in 1962. Why he couldn't wait until the end of the 2nd Vatican Council (1962-1965) probably tells me that he had to put down in writing his pent up hatred before the Catholic Church, through the results of the conclave, changed any of his antagonisms. From what I have read about Vatican II it has changed the Catholic Church a lot, while still maintaining the core beliefs of the Catholic Church that go directly back to the time of Christ.Loraine Boettner did not die until January 1990, but he never wrote a direct rebuttal to this book. Which will lead you to ask WHY? The answer is simple: After the book was released it was clear that Boettner made a fool of himself, and to admit that he was wrong in his dates and other fantastic claims he would have been made to look like more of a fool.It was noted straight away that Boettner's book `Roman Catholicism' is full of false information and unsubstantiated claims. At the time of it's publication Boettner was already an author who had four previous books published. And for him to admit in a follow up book that he was wrong, would have had him put on a `Black List' of writers never to be published again, despite his Publisher being; The Presbyterian and Reformed Publishing Company. This publisher of Theological works is known for their theological bigotry, against any Church or organization that doesn't believe what they do, but especially against the Catholic Church. But it still does not answer the question why this book has been reprinted again, and who is responsible for the book being reprinted.In the introduction alone Boettner lists dates that are not accurate, not just by years or decades, but by CENTURIES! And he goes on to invent councils and conclaves that never happened. True, some of councils he lists did take place, but in referring to these councils and what was the major theological item that that council will be remembered for are totally inaccurate. To a theologically un-educated individual it seems that he is an impressive writer that took the time to investigate all he wrote is true and accurate, so naturally the reader assumes everything being written is true and correct.The one thing that got me to read Boettner's book in it's entirety is that in his introduction Boettner lists 44 items that he calls; "Some Roman Catholic Heresies and Inventions" and goes on to list the dates of their Adoptions over a period of 1650 years. To the un-educated individual this seems impressive, to start his book with such bravado. But with me Boettner was dealing with an individual who took the time to really investigate these `Heresies and Inventions.' No matter what were Boettner's thoughts as he wrote these `Heresies and Inventions' there were too many to hit the reader with at the very beginning of the book, and second they sounded too fantastic. In investigating these claims I found that every one of these 44 claims were not only un-substantiated, downright fraudulent and full of half-truths.There is an old saying that says that a man who tells lies, like politician tend to do, simply hides the truth. A man who tells the truth, like a military officer when questioned by his superior, is an honorable individual. But a man who tells half-truths, like Boettner, has simply forgotten where and what the truth is.It didn't take me long in reading Loraine Boettner book to realize that he epitomizes the old axiom that was used so successfully by Adolph Hitler. Boettner's claims are so fantastic that like Hitler, Boettner is one that thinks, by his writing; "If you tell a big enough lie, People will believe it."Boettner tries to give the reader that he is an academic, when all he is, is a frustrated bigoted writer who is so jealous, and so scared of the Catholic Church that he MUST tell lies that are big enough that people will believe him.Just to give an example of the wild claims that Boettner writes to try to make the reader believe he is an academic, are his claims that the Roman Catholic Church did nothing to help defeat the spread of communism throughout the world and that only the Protestant nations of the world were the only catalysts in fighting Communism. Boettner even goes on to name countries like the United States, Canada, The Netherlands and Spain having spearheaded the fight against the spread of Communism.This again sounds to the reader that Boettner did a good investigative job in naming what he claims are predominant Protestant countries that were leading the fight against Communism.However I'm one who believes that statistics don't lie and one only has to look at statistics to show that in Canada 42.6% of the population is Catholic, as opposed to Protestants representing only 23.3% of the population. In the Netherlands Roman Catholicism is the largest Christian denomination, larger than all the other Christian denominations put together. *In the United States Roman Catholicism has a membership of 74,455,877 million persons, far outdistancing the closest Protestant denomination of Baptists whose membership in July 2010 was recorded at 32,591,991 million individuals divided into 19 different Baptist sects, with the Southern Baptist Convention being the largest with a membership total of 16,228,438. *Then we have Spain, who was been a very strong and supportive member of NATO, where 94% of the population of over 40,500,000 million people profess Catholicism as their Religion. *Finally in the fight against Communism, lets look at Poland where 89.8% of the population of over 38,500,000 million people are Roman Catholic.*During the cold war the government of this Poland may have been communist, but it was the courageous fight of the people of Poland that started the domino effect that eventually toppled every country in Europe that were members of the Warsaw Pact and at one time had a Communist government loyal to Moscow.*Bottner's total ignorance of how the communist system of government works shows out here. In the Marxist-Leninist Communist system of government only 10% of the total adult population were allowed to become `card-carrying' members of the party. Levin believed that the smaller the number of dedicated Communists that held the reigns of power would suffice to keep the country under the yoke of Communism.This is why we have countries like Poland, Hungry, East Germany, Bulgaria, Romania and Czechoslovakia, for example, where extremely small number of loyal Communists controlled the government while large segments of the population never belonged or supported the Communist system of government they had between 1945 and 1989.Hence you have seen uprisings starting in Czechoslovakia in 1948 against Communism, which ended when the President of Czechoslovakia was `pushed' out the window of the upper floor of the Hradcany Castle by Communist agitators to take over the government of that formally `free' country after World War II. Other uprisings against Communist rule were in Poznan, Poland in June of 1956, in Budapest, Hungary in late summer and early fall of 1956, and again in Czechoslovakia in 1968 only 2 months before the Olympic Games.Who can forget the look on the Czech athletes at the Olympic Games in Mexico City in the fall of 1968 when any Czech athlete was on the same stand to receive their medal with an athlete from the Soviet Union. Not only would they not shake the hand of the Soviet athlete, but actually walked off the stand if the Soviet athlete received the gold medal and the Soviet national anthem was played.All of these uprisings prior to 1989 resulted in the small minority of the people that formed the government of those countries having to call on the Soviet Union to send in tanks and the military from the Soviet Union to squash these uprisings.And this dynamic 'domino effect' was directly caused by the fall of the communist government in Poland, again a country whose population was made up of almost 90% Roman Catholics.The fall of the communist government of Poland was followed shortly afterward by the fall of the communist governments of Hungry, Czechoslovakia, and even the former communist state of the DDR, the Deutsche (German) Democratic Republic of East Germany, and eventually Russia herself in 1991.Do you remember that November of 1989 when the Berlin Wall came down?Even "Republics" in the old USSR split away from Moscow, leaving only the "Republic" of Russia on its own. Among the modern day countries that were created after the fall of communism in the former Soviet Union are: The Ukraine and Belarus, not to mention the formation of the three Baltic Countries that were all former "Republics" in the Soviet Union of: Estonia, Latvia, and finally Lithuania, who population is 79% Roman Catholic.**All these figures can be substantiated by referring to the "CIA World Factbook, 2011" which is available thru Amazon, or any reputable book retailer.I could spend page after page in listing all the unsubstantiated claims Boettner makes in his book, many of which are just downright lies written to make the reader believe what they are reading are the true facts.In the end I could say is that this book could be considered a "Hate" book written by someone who really does hate the Roman Catholic Church. I find it very interesting that the Roman Catholic Church itself ignores Boettner's book, and many of the other Anti-Catholic literature, and leaves it up to laity of the church to defend it from hate mongering writers like Loraine Boettner, and other virulent Anti-Catholic writers like Bob Jones and Jimmy Swaggart, because the church itself has better things to do than to answer all the Anti-Catholic Hate literature, and leaves these `rebuttals' up to the laity of the Church through organizations like "Catholic Answers" based in El Cajon, California.Just consider that if this book had been written against the Jewish faith, the Anti-Defamation League would have had Boettner in court long ago, but the Roman Catholic Church would rather spread the word of Christ and let these hate writers burn themselves out as will be their eventual fate.One last observation in regards to Boettner's book is that I spent many, many years in Europe, and it is only in America that these books are published to any large degree. Which brings me to ask myself the question of; Why is it that only in America do hate filled Anti-Catholic fundamentalists write this trash.If I could give the book NO Stars at all I would, but Amazon requires I give a book a rating from 1 to 5 stars. Well here is a hate filled book that is full of lies and unsubstantiated claims that make the writer look about 2" tall.No matter how many times this book continues to be reprinted, it only shows that there are still more hate filled Anti-Catholic mongers out there trying to spread Loraine Boettner's bigoted views. This book should be pulled from the shelves of all reputable bookstores, and thrown into the trash.And don't forget that the author of this review comes from a family that is Lutheran!

review/text: Michael Ball has come out with another superb album of songs from the musical theater. The choice of songs is eclectic, from the signature songs of the mega-musicals ( Les Miserables, Phantom of the Opera and Sondheim classics) as well as newer songs from more contemporary musicals. The difference between this album and his first musicals album seems to be in the story-like approach to the sequence of songs he sings here. Somehow it is reminiscent of the songs which best illustrate the life of a stage performer. This partly explains the beautiful and poignant air of melancholy that pervades the album. Michael has lifted his performance level yet even another notch -- the interpretation of the various songs gives us the depth and breadth of Mr. Ball's extrordinary musical gift. We are treated not only to his glorious voice but to his ability to deliver a performance rich with the nuances of life's many emotions. Don't miss out on this album, which should really be released in the USA. His version of Send in the Clowns and A Boy from Nowhere alone are worth the cost of this import album.

review/text: Francie begins this story as an eleven-year-old, living in poverty in Brooklyn. Her father is an alcoholic who takes part-time work as a singing waiter. Her mother cleans houses to bring in most of their money. Francie and her ten-year-old brother, Neely, help out by collecting bits of scrap metal and other valuables to sell to the junk man for recycling. The family lives in a tiny apartment, is looked down on by many others and often they go hungry when money doesn't stretch far enough to buy food.Despite all of the hardships in her life, though, Francie is nearly overwhelmed by the beauty of the life she is living. She loves her father's singing voice, and she loves the things her mother is able to cook with their meager supply of food. She finds peace in listening to her parents talk late at night, and joy in reading every book she can get her hands on. She is happy in the way only a child can be.As Francie grows up, she comes to find that life is often hard, and her family is less fortunate than many. She observes the sacrifices her family members make, and is called upon to make sacrifices of her own. Throughout it all, though, she never loses her determination or her love for her family and for Brooklyn.The way Francie thinks and writes is absolutely beautiful. I like how Smith captured that peculiar habit of children to see the beauty in even the worst of circumstances. I liked the beginning of this book much better than the end, though. I was eager to see Francie and her family come into some money and have an easier life, but I felt the end of the book to be a bit too happy to fit with the rest. When an entire book is about struggling and fending for yourself, it doesn't seem right when something good happens, as it did to Francie's mother, out of the blue.

review/text: I love it!!! It's made of sturdy rubber on the outside, and soft cotton on the inside. It really makes you sit straight and pushes your breasts upwards!!! I've only been wearing it for a few hours. And unlike the other customers, it was easy to put on at first, then after two hours, i went to the second hook. It's comfortable and really gives me the hourglass figure i wanted!!!I think this will give me the shape i want after a few months of use, so I'll update later!! :)--Update--I really had a hard time with this the first day. It rolls all around my waist and i feel so hot in it! and when i took it off, it itched like hell!!! i had to put ointment all over my tummy! But you get used to it eventually, i almost never take it off, i even wear it to bed!! My body does keep the shape afterwards. It held it for five minutes after the first time, ten minutes after the second and so on. It doesn't really reduce my appetite, i just feel really uncomfortable in it if i eat a lot. But it's really worth the price!! I'll update again a while later! :)--Update--Okay i had to take out one star. Yeah it does work and everything but it itches so bad!!! i put a light camisole shirt underneath, but it still itches! my skin burns for hours after i take it off!!! On the plus side, it's only been 2 weeks and i already lost 2 inches off my waist! but i have to do something about that itching! and i wash it every three to four day... maybe i should wash it every day? Or maybe I'm allergic to something in it! i really don't know, but it's very annoying

review/text: I've never used this type of push-in wire connector before, although I've seen them used in the trade by others with mixed success. I finally decided to give it a try with a remodeling job where I had a lot of connections in several boxes and little room. Here's my experience:Wires must be stripped to the proper length. This is much more critical than with twist connectors (wire nuts). Too short and they won't make proper connection since they may not be able to insert fully, too long and you will have exposed bare wire which could make contact with other conductors or the box and equipment metal. Improper length is likely the main problem that people have had. The wire appears to make good contact inside the connector and the clear plastic allows you to see that (or if you need to push more wire in).You still need nearly as much free wire penetrating from the box. The two-wire connectors are easy to get aligned, but the multiple connectors need the wire length so you can get them pushed into the connector straight in and without bending the wire. I was unable to do this without using pliers except for the two-wire connectors, although with more experience it may become simpler. So unless you are really experienced, these are probably not faster.The real benefit is that (except for the two-wire connectors) these push-in connectors take much less room in the box, especially considering that with twist-type connectors, the wires must be all lined up parallel with each other for an inches or two before entering the connector. More than a couple of twist connectors containing three or more wires each and you are soon fighting for more box space. With these push-in connectors, each wire can bend in a different direction as soon as it leaves the conector.A final note. Removing solid wire from these connectors is easy: just rotate the wire while pulling it out. Stranded wires must be cut and the connector discarded and replaced.Amazon had the best price for the types that I needed, but if you only need a couple, you may be able to get a small selection from Lowes or Home Depot immediately and at less cost.

review/text: A forward to this book written by Asimov himself makes reference to his publisher's wish that he write additional foundation novels, and implies that their incessant demands eventually overcame his own reluctance to do so. Almost as if he's saying to the reader, "Hey, don't blame me for this steaming pile. They made me do it."If I had Asimov's resume, I'd be reluctant to put my name on this book as well.As the title implies, Foundation and Earth is about the protagonists' continued search for the world of origin. Unfortunately, unlike Foundation's Edge, the journey itself is not long enough to fill the requisite 500 pages, so we're subjected to endless interludes of casual conversation between protagonists which are completely irrelevant to character or story progression. A simple question will launch a character into a tedious three-page monologue that reads more like an essay than dialogue.As other reviewers have said, the primary purpose of these later books was to tie each of Asimov's sci-fi series together into one universe. This works alright for the robots, but does more harm than good to the legacy of The Foundation.If you've read the original Foundation novels, It's likely that no negative review will dissuade you from reading this one. Therefore, I commiserate with you in advance.

review/text: The original heartbreaking Hollywood romantic drama, "A Star is Born" makes its debut on Blu-ray.While many people are familiar with George Cukor's 1954 classic film adaptation starring Judy Garland and James Mason, the very first film was back in 1937 and was produced by David O. Selznick (the producer known for "Gone with the Wind" and bringing Alfred Hitchock to the United States to direct "Rebecca" and "Spellbound") and a film directed by William A. Wellman ("Wings", "Nothing Sacred"). The film was written by Wellman, Robert Carson, Dorothy Parker and Alan Campbell.The film would star Janet Gaynor ("Seventh Heaven", "Sunrise: A Song of Two Humans", "Street Angel", "Lucky Star"), Fredric March ("The Best Year of Our Lives", "Nothing Sacred", "Design for Living") and Adolphe Menjou ("Paths of Glory", "A Farewell to Arms")."A Star is Born" was nominated for seven Academy Awards, winning "Best Story" (and also earning a special Academy Award for "Technicolor Cinematography" for W. Howard Greene) and would become the first color film to be nominated for "Best Picture".While there are earlier Hollywood films that would be based on one trying to make it in Hollywood or the perils of fame, "A Star is Born" would surprise audiences with its tragic ending and for a film of it's time, it was a a romantic drama that was an instant tearjerker.VIDEO:"A Star is Born" is presented in 1080p High Definition (1:33:1). It's one of the earlier Technicolor films and while this film has been released on DVD before, many who have seen this film, saw it via terrible quality public domain videos. May they have been downloaded or purchased on DVD.I have seen the original public domain version and because it was Technicolor and in bad quality, for me, those public domain versions were unwatchable. Fast forward to 2012 and Kino Lorber has presented us an authorized edition from the estate of David O. Selznick from the collection of George Eastman House.With that being said, for those who are not familiar with Kino Lorber, they are not like a major studio or the Criterion Collection. They do not do frame-by-frame restorations which is very expensive and laborious but they present the best quality of a film to present on Blu-ray. So, these are films that will have dust, white specks and damage. Kino Lorber is also selective on what releases will receive a Blu-ray release and with "A Star is Born", I'm pretty happy that they did choose this classic film and give it an HD release.As expected from early Technicolor films, the colors are a bit softer than what one are used to seeing from a Technicolor film from the '50s or '60s, but still, there is clarity. And compared to the public domain releases out there, this Blu-ray release of "A Star is Born" is a huge step via picture quality as colors are not faded. Sure, there is some film damage and white specks but the clarity, the colors and even the black levels look great for this 75-year-old film and its worth upgrading from the PD copies and even the previous DVD's to this Blu-ray release.AUDIO & SUBTITLES:"A Star is Born" is presented in Linear PCM 2.0 monaural and once again, Kino Lorber doesn't clean up their releases. They present the best quality of a film on Blu-ray.So, there are moments of mild hissing and occasional pops but by no means will this affect your viewing. Dialogue is clear, Max Steiner's music is also clear and definitely much more pleasant to the ears compared to the PD release.There are no subtitles.SPECIAL FEATURES:"A Star is Born" comes with the following special features:Gallery - Featuring 16 stills, posters and lobby cards.Wardrobe Test - (1:15) A Technicolor wardrobe test.Kino Classics TrailersJUDGMENT CALL:Before there was "Sunset Boulevard" and before the George Cukor classic starring Judy Garland, there was the 1937 William Wellman original.And while the 1954 film was quite memorable and also was a musical with a different storyline, "A Star Is Born" is rather interesting because it took on a storyline of what was happening in Hollywood at that time.Bare in mind, the transition from the silent era to the talkies, was the most difficult transition for many Hollywood talents. While many were well-known in silent films, many who transitioned to talking films, saw their careers decline. There was no gradual decline, one year you were hot, the next year your career was over.And it has been well-documented of the many Hollywood talents that were unable to transition their careers from the 1920's to the 1930's and became alcoholics.And while the classic film "Sunset Boulevard" featured that type of storyline focusing on a popular actress and her decline, in the 1930's, there were films that took on tabloid news about celebrity suicides and George Cukor (who directed the Judy Garland "A Star is Born"), directed a 1932 film titled "What Price is Hollywood?" that dealt with one's waning career (an interesting side note: David O. Selznick admitted that Cukor's 1932 film was used as source material for "A Star is Born").But with William Wellman's "A Star is Born" is your classic Hollywood story about a celebrity couple. Unlike the 1954 version which Judy Garland used as a vehicle to once again showcase her vocals, this is no musical. This is about two people who found love, but yet as one becomes a star, the other becomes a falling star and is unable to cope with his fall from stardom.And with the 1954 version, you expect Judy Garland to sing. With Janet Gaynor, what many have known her from is F.W. Murnau's "Sunrise: A Song of Two Humans", "7th Heaven" and "Lucky Star". Often she played the heartbroken woman, but for this film, she had a chance to show off various sides of her acting, may it be the tearful farmgirl who wants to go to Hollywood, the comedic actress trying to show off her acting impersonations to Hollywood higher-ups and most importantly, playing the strong-willed wife who has achieved success thanks to her husband.So, Gaynor was an intriguing actress to play the role of Vicki, because we see a different side to her acting.Fredric March on the other hand, he has always played the suave character. May it be his role in "Design for Living" to "Nothing Sacred", he is a charismatic actor and while his Norman Maine portrays him as strong-willed (this is a man who stays a man and never shows his sensitive side) man who is an alcoholic (strong-willed, but inside, he is frustrated and depressed).The original also was helped by its surrounding characters. May Robson does a fine job of playing the sensible grandmother (who actually has a wonderful supporting actress role in the film, a character missing in the 1954 version), Adolphe Menjou as the producer Oliver Niles and bumbling Andy Devine as Vicki's good friend, Danny.This is a film that focuses on the perils of fame and while I enjoyed this 1937 film for keeping within the confines of a Hollywood story without the "happily ever after", it's George Cukor's film that was full of emotion. Not to say that Janet Gaynor and Fredric March lacked emotion at all, it's acting that was common for 1930's, Judy Garland and James Mason took the role to another level in the 1954 film adaptation. There is no doubt that the musical version was emotionally charged and was much more of an emotional film.While both films are similar, yet they were very different and needless to say, George Cukor knew how to make the remake even more powerful and emotional than the original film.Still, for any cinema fan, a chance to see Janet Gaynor in her Academy Award "Best Actress" nominated performance and to see her in a much different light than she was previously seen in the Murnau films (and also to see her in early Technicolor) was quite enjoyable. Also, if musicals are not your thing and has pushed you away from watching the 1954 version, fortunately in 2012, we have the best version of the original "A Star is Born" on video ala Blu-ray. You can trash those public domain versions or give them away to a friend, but if you want the definitive version of this 1937 film, this Blu-ray release is the way to go!Granted, the picture and audio quality may not be pristine but still, this Blu-ray release is so much better than the old public domain copies and the film has never looked so good until now!Overall, "A Star is Born" is another wonderful release from Kino Lorber and a fine addition to their Kino Classics lineup on Blu-ray. I look forward to more of these classic Hollywood films from Kino! Definitely recommended!

Which plants for what type of shade)- No information on when and how often to water- Very little information on when to harvest- Very little information on how to take care of your plants in case of insects or diseases.This DVD was mainly about the plants the author chose to plant, spending about 15 minutes on the various varieties of tomato plants.The only good part of this DVD was the interview with Mel.

I'm not really sure why Asimov thought that the future galaxy would be ruled by an emporer, which is a dying system of government, instead of a democratic republic. I know this is nit-picking, but I didn't like this book.Apparently, the future can be predicted with a high degree of accuracy using math and statistics. Anyone who works as a mathematician or statistician, as I do, knows that it's difficult to predict what's going to happen in anyone's life tomorrow, much less the entire world 500 to 1000 years into the future using statistics.This book is intellectual worship, which is something I can't stand. Intellectual worship is when people think they are intellecually superior to everyone else, so feel they should rule over everyone else, if only you would listen to them. This idea drips off the page as event after event is predicted by some really smart dude. This smart dude predicted a collapse of civilization and treated it as inevitable. Another idea that's patently absurd- that any event that occurs is inevitable.If this guy was so smart as to predict, with a high degree of accuracy, the downfall of civilization, and the rising of a new one, along with the traumatic events this new civilization would go through, why wasn't he smart enough to avert the downfall of the original civilization. Surely, with his predictive ability people would listen to him, but he decides to let it crumble for whatever reason.And Asimov is a mediocre writer. The story is only moderately interesting because no character really gets developed. I read this book because as a sci-fi fan, I felt obligated.

review/text: This is the greatest horror film, and one of the greatest films ever, period.Everything in it works. From that terrific tag line to the creepy poster art, to that off kilter lullaby Mia Farrow croons, to every single performance, line of dialogue and scene. The cast is perfection. The terror is palpable. The extras set the movie in its time, but the movie has surpased its time and become, like all true classics, for the ages. The Bramley will never be razed for a parking lot. Ira Levin's superb novel was blessed by Roman Polanski's film. Both are landmarks touched with more than a little genius.The movie is wickedly funny, deliciously entrancing, groundbreakingly "real" because it's horror is set in present day New York; also, the elderly couple next door, who are the coven leaders, are played to the hilt by nosey Ruth Gordon and the intriguing Sidney Blackmer; therefore, it's easy to come under their spell. Blackmer especially gives an almost noble performance that is rich and wise. The entire cast is at the top of their game.Maurice Evan's Hutch is the hope and comfort of the film, the logical reality against what is inexorably happening, while Ralph Bellamy's Dr. Saperstein (he was on "Open End," you know)is that soft spoken easygoing evil that you just know hides a little below the surface of most of his ilk. It's also fun seeing Hope Summers (Clara Edwards of "The Andy Griffith Show") as a Satanist. Not out of character here, really. Did Aunt Bea ever find out?It's ironic that the movie probably could not be made today. The current crop of puritans would rail against it; odd, since the bare bones of the plot hew to what they say they believe. But while those lame Left Behind movies and the others artlessly propound beating foolish stuff into its audiences heads, "Rosemary's Baby" plays knowingly with fiction, with what ifs, with the paranoia come true, all in a twisty gripping eerie exciting film, produced by the great William Castle, who has just the right cameo that comes with the chill first, then the laughter.Mia Farrow's heart wrenching Rosemary Woodhouse leads us into her terror and pain, then into her first goosebumpy nightmare come true reaction to her son, propelling into that final reaction, maybe even scarier, as the camera wisely pans to the window and the outside of the Bramley. There are some fine character actors as well, always dependable Elisha Cook, Jr. Philip Leeds and Patsy Kelly.John Cassavetes, as Guy Woodhouse, also creeps us out as he sells himself and Rosemary, and I guess, their baby, and the world, to Satan, to further his acting career. Being in bit parts in "Luther" and "Nobody Loves an Albatross" can only take an actor just so far. Priorities, after all. So settle down with some "plain old Lipton Tea," a bowl of "chocolate mouse" and a Vodkda Blush, and watch a classic again or for the first time. Watch out for mouse bites, though.

review/text: If I hadn't read other books by Belva Plain, I would give this book 5 stars. It was a good book, but she has done so much better in books like Evergreen and Legacy of Silence. This was a fast read (I did it in 3 days, along with working 8 hours each day and studying) and I was wrapt until the middle of the book, when I realized exactly what was going to happen. I finished the book, with hopes that I was incorrect. I was disappointed with the transparent climax, but overall this is worthwhile, especially if you haven't read any of Plain's greater works or can forget that you have.

review/text: I've read other books by Gabriel Garcia Marquez and have enjoyed them. This one left me cold, however. The story was very muddled and Marquez wrote in such a matter-of-fact style that there were no ups and downs. It was like watching a heart monitoring machine. Whether someone was being executed, eating lunch, or anything else, Marquez just stated everything very matter of factly. Also, the names in the book were far too similar for the average reader. I just wonder if the people who give this book great reviews are doing it on its own merit or whether they are afraid to break from the pack. It reminds me of the Emperor's New Clothes where everyone was afraid to admit that they didn't know the emperor didn't have clothes on for fear of looking stupid. Of course, it could just be me. I look for things that have a real plot or a real end they're striving for. I didn't find it in this book. I also found the spiritualism hard to believe such as Remedios the Beauty ascending into the heavens. That's a bit much for even a romantic person.

review/text: This is a real yawn fest. After the main character walks in front of her place of work for the 100th time and says the same &quot;catch phrases&quot; a 1,000 times, my eyelids could not control themselves any longer. The DVD extras weren't much better. There was a makeshift documentary about Morrissey fans and commentary from people involved with the film. I don't even know what they did or who they were but the makeup artist sticks clearly in my mind. I don't think the main characters were even in the room for this &quot;special feature.&quot; Boring and Lame.

review/text: "Blow" is based on the true story of George Jung (Johnny Depp in one of his best roles), the loving son of a struggling businessman (Ray Liotta) who, as a child, upon seeing his family struggle to make ends meet and witnessing his mother's (Rachel Griffiths) resentment for his father because of their low income, vows to never be poor. Thus ensues Jung's descent into the world of drugs. He begins his three-decade rise and abrupt fall as a drug lord smuggling pot into the US in his early 20's during the pot-crazed 60's, which garners him an enormous amount of cash. After landing a lengthy jail sentence, he meets Diego Delgado (Jordi Moll&agrave;) in jail who introduces George to the far more profitable world of cocaine dealing. He soon shoots to the top of the game and his biggest problem becomes where to put all of his cash. It is said that if you used cocaine during the 70's and 80's, there's an 85% chance it came from Jung.Over the years he struggles with a crack-addicted wife (Pen&eacute;lope Cruz as you've never seen her before), the relationship with his young daughter, and maintaining his relationship with the only person who truly cares for him in the world, his father. Additionally, Jung is portrayed in a sympathetic light as a nice guy who just makes some bad decisions. Usually I disagree with this type of "glamorization" of criminals, but I feel that in Jung's case it is truly deserved."Blow" is not only the fascinating, pulse-pounding, and historically informative chronicle of the rise and fall of one of America's most influential drug lords; it also the exploration of some very deep personal connections, such as very deep father/son connection between George and his father. In addition, George's love for his daughter, who ends up being the single thing motivating him to stay alive throughout his jail sentences, delivers a powerful emotional impact in the film's final scenes. I also appreciated how director Ted Demme delicately showed us the parallels between George's mother's resentment for his father and George's wife's resentment for him after he loses most of his money as well as George's struggle to be a good father just as his own father did.The final scenes of "Blow" are surprisingly moving, which ultimately distinguishes it from all of the other crime films out there.

review/text: I saw this film six times when it played in IMAX theaters about seven years ago, often taking friends who had not seen it. Since then I have been annually pestering the people at Extreme as to when a DVD might be available. This year's email turned up gold; it's out!I think this film is utterly extraordinary. To me it's actually a serene meditation on art, beauty, elegance, and the human spirit. I'd been hoping for a DVD release because I periodically felt a need for an Extreme "fix"; and it simply has not been available at regional IMAX theaters anymore. I would love to see it occasionally when I need reassurance as to what is worthwhile in the human spirit!The previously released soundtrack is also one of my favorite albums. And the pairing of that music to the film is unbelievably inspired, For example, Morsheeba's "The Sea" is played during a snow/mountain episode, not during the surfing -- and it works so PERFECTLY! Whoever coordinated the soundtrack is a genius imho! It's right up there with "The Good, the Bad, and the Ugly" and just a handful of other movies as having perfect soundtracks (again: imho!). Along these lines, when the film was showing at our local IMAX theater, a reviewer wrote a basically good review -- except that he criticized the soundtrack. He said the music should have been more driving -- hard metal or some such. I just shook my head and wondered at how he could so totally and utterly miss the point of "Extreme." I guess he thought it should have been some kind of testosterone fest with pounding music to drive home the point. I'll stick with my assessment of the film as a meditation!

review/text: In Fahrenheit 451, Ray Bradbury's frightening vision of the future, firemen don't put fires out; they start them to burn books. In Bradbury's fictional world, it is better not to know or find out anything because if you know too much, you could be in danger. This book is closely related to the book 1984 by George Orwell because you can be put to death for simple things like writing in a diary. In Fahrenheit 451, you can have your house burned down and go to jail for the rest of your life if you are caught with books because reading for pleasure is against the law. The main character, Guy Montag, is a fireman who burns books for a living. He sees his wife sit at home everday with the "family" who is actually just a television that surrounds the walls, when he starts to question his life. Why are books burned? Why are they so destructive to society? He makes the decision to change his life, risk everything he's worked for and discover what it is that books contain. Montag starts secretly hiding books in his house and reading them at any opportunity he gets. He learns that there is a whole world inside of books that he never knew existed. He tries to tell his wife about this and how books are so important but instead of agreeing, she turns him in to the police. After this incident, Montag's house is burned down and he is confronted by the police chief, Captain Beatty, and has to decide what he is going to do. Although this book was published back in 1953, the idea of firemen getting paid for burning books seems very real. These ideas make you think that maybe someday this could happen. Fahrenheit 451 is a book for ages 13 and up. The incredible descriptions of books burning,along with houses and the mechanical dog are very realistic. I thought this book was good because of the descriptions, you felt like a part of the book and it made you want to keep reading. I would recommene this book to any and everyone.

review/text: During my lifetime, I have always enjoyed playing video games and watching tv. I was a true couch potatoe, and barely left to go play with my friends. And the thing I hated most was reading. Any book, no matter how interesting, could't keep my attention, and didn't keep me reading. Language Arts was my least favorite class, becuase reading was so boaring at the time. When I moved to California ,I made a new friend named Tina. We both shared the intrest in video games, but she loved to read. Eventually, she told me about this book. I told her I loved cats, and read the prelouge. At first, I nodded it off, telling her that I'm not really into reading. But the next time I went over thier, I looked at the book again. It was like pulling me into it. It was the only book that caught my intrest. I kept reading, and pretty soon, it was the best book ever. It could make someone like Tina that hated cats before, love them. She even got 2 of them becuase of the books! When I was finished that book, my life changed. I started reading the rest of the series, and read the ones I've already read. When you read them, its like you're in another world. I, the one who hated books and never picked on up in my life, actually cried, laughed, and yelled positive and negative things about the characters in the book, like I was actually their. My language arts grade went up when I became one of the quickest and most observant readers in the class, and I even looked at my greenbelt, aware of the freedom it brings. This brought me outside, playing sports, and running around with friends. Every person that I suggest these books to read the first chapter, and can't stop! I assure you you will be satisfied, and even more! I read all kinds of books now, but nothing compares to the excitment, the saddness, and the love in Warriors: Into the Wild.BTW, I'm 13, so for all parents out their, my mother loves the books too. They're great for children, and their fall in love with the cats. But it's also great for teens and adults. Before hand, my mother would tell me something like, "Get off the couch, pick up a book, and read!" But now, my mom alwas says something like, "Get off the couch, put down the book, and go to bed!"

review/text: I really enjoy this book. I am a woodworker / furniture maker and I read a lot of this style of book. The author does a fantastic job of illustrating each box and providing a bit of background on each box. The photos are all in color and very well composed.The boxes range from a tea box recovered from the harbor at the Boston Tea Party to HO Studley's over-the-top tool chest to a standard GI foot locker.The book is well-organized. There is little wood working technique described so if you are looking for a how-to book, this ain't the book for you. However, the author briefly describes uncommon techniques such as lapstrake construction (common in shipbuilding but almost unheard of in furniture making).

review/text: Those reviews of this Sam's book that complain that it is a rehash, too basic, etc. are misguided. They must not have payed close attention to the scope and purpose of this book! I came to Visual C++ knowing ZERO about C++ or GUI (I thought it was spelled &quot;gooey&quot;) or much else about programming. Yet, with this book I managed to create a useful, functional windows program in a few weeks that is now being utilized by a busy doctor's office. THIS BOOK IS FOR BEGINNERS, NOT HIGHLY EXPERIENCED PROGRAMMERS. Honestly, having looked into other books on the subject I have no idea how I'd have been able to learn what I did as quickly as I did if not for the Sam's book. Granted, it doesn't cover everything, but no book can. It covers more than enough of the basics to get up and running in a surprising amount of time. BEGINNERS: BUY THIS BOOK!

review/text: I have had this wonderful box set for less than a month, and I'm already beginning to wear out the 4 wonderful cd's. For the amount of money it costs, this is the greatest box set ever assembled, and I'm sure of it. These 4 magnificent cd's, cool cardboard case, and excellent booklet cost less than 25 dollars! Although the first cd starts off a bit weak, and the forth cd has some songs that aren't Hank's best, 90% of the songs in this collection are absolutely impeccable! Before I purchased this collection, I knew that Hank Williams was excellent, but I had no idea that he was a God. How on earth did such a simple and uneducated man write these lyrics?! Some of the poetry in these songs, especially on the depressing and melancholy tunes, is comparable to the work of all of Europe's greatest classical writers and poets. If you have the "40 Greatest Hits" cd's, you should still buy this! This is because the demo's at the end of disc three contain some of Hank's best lyrics, and these songs are not included on "40 Greatest Hits". There is more to Hank Williams than just his hits! He doesn't just have great party songs, he also has extremely dark and cryptic songs about death and misery, and glorious and heavenly spiritual tunes. In conclusion, Hank Williams belongs up there with Robert Johnson, Louis Armstrong, Blind Willie Johnson, Blind Lemon Jefferson, Son House, Django Reinhardt, Bessie Smith, Louis Jordan etc. In other words, Hank too, was the blues; and he was a God!

review/text: I had seen an older version of this video at a friend's house, and decided to buy it for myself. When I saw this updated version (it's brand new it seems!) I figured I'd give it a try- and I love it! First of all, I love the fact that there are all these diverse couples in the video, and that at the very end, you get to see them all with their adorable babies!! But more importantly, I just like the way the instructor - Sheri Bayles- makes it incredibly easy to understand all this stuff you need to know about your pregnancy. And she's funny, too!Thanks to Sheri, I feel much more prepared and less nervous about the pregnancy, and I can only recommend her video-class to everybody who likes to learn about pregnancy on their own time and wants to have a little fun doing so, too!

review/text: In this whimsical, animated film, a lone unicorn seeks out others like herself through a mystical land of talking cats and spellbinding magicians. Based on the book by Peter S. Beagle, this story has enamored the hearts of fans - young and old - from around the globe. In her search for other unicorns, the last unicorn encounters a cast of delightful characters as well as dangers she never imagined. Throughout the fantastic adventure, she learns of friendship, love, and most importantly, her true self. Discover the magic that has kept this tale a treasured classic. Featuring the voices of Jeff Bridges, Mia Farrow and Angela Lansbury, the story brings forth the power of friendship, the beauty of love and the pain of regret. Interlaced with songs and ethereal imagery, The Last Unicorn will reignite the hearts of its fans and entrance all who enter.I decided to try this movie because my daughter currently loves unicorns. Her overall opinion was that the movie is "To long but great!" She had this to say as well, "I liked it because it was nice and had a unicorn and I love unicorns. My favorite part was the red bull. The worst part was when the witch died because she was old and mean." My husband really enjoyed the music to this movie. We agreed with my daughter, the movie is too long and is easy to lose interest in. I was shocked when I looked at the running time to see it is only 93 minutes. The movie felt much longer. Our least favorite part was in the beginning of the movie. About the time you first meet the unicorn you are also introduced to a rambling butterfly that you would really prefer to stop talking.On the technical side, the difference between the DVD and Blu-ray edition is so minor that to the untrained eye, or for most consumers, one would not recognize the Blu-ray disc from the DVD version. The quality of both disc are the same due to the movie being drawn rather than shot with high definition cameras. Quite frankly, it can only be so good. Both DVD's feature Schmendricks Magical Gallery and a mini documentary in the special features section. The DVD holds a game "Escape the Red Bull" for users to enjoy. The Blu-ray disc holds a commentary.The original movie was made in 1982 and is based off the well loved novel, The Last Unicorn by Peter S. Beagle. If you are a fan of this book or movie you'll love this upgraded version which holds the best quality the movie can boast with current technology. If you've never seen the movie, the story is unique and worth the watch. I would suggest renting it before you purchase this film as the story is one that will, most likely, interest current fans of The Last Unicorn rather than shake up a new fan base.Reviewed for BookPleasures (dot)(com)

review/text: ...you should acquire this title. It's encyclopedic in scope on the topic of garlic, and L.J. Harris has a lively writing style and a passion for the subject that keeps it from ever becoming stuffy or long-winded. Health Quarterly described him in their review as "kindly, mischievous and talented". Included are chapters on references to garlic in the Talmudic and Mohammedan traditions and quotes from Pliny and Virgil that are surprisingly contemporary in their points of view about health and society. Herbalist and culinary traditions from China and India are represented, as are the viewpoints of the British (alliophobic) and the French (alliocentric, depending on geography and politics). Literary lore, folk medicine, herbalist tradition, and culture & politics all contribute to this very readable volume. My two favorite recipes were Puerto Rican Garlic & Egg Soup, and Nancy's Artichoke Pie.

review/text: Don't see Turistas if you think your gonna see some great horror flick: instead STAY HOME...This was not a horror film. It was not scarey nor gorey at all. Like many horror or occult films that were over hyped yet totally, well, SUCKED! (1. Hostel=why a sequel? Put this moronic film to bed 2. Covenant=it was like watching a boy band in a VERY bad "Spookey" movie) Turistas is definateley the 3rd part to the trilogy of horror movies that totally sucked in 2006.Only one person gets buthered (well, their liver and kidneys are removed=that's it! The only scene you could consider to be gorey=and it's used twice in the film, as the movie opener and is reprised later in the story. The others that are the victims either fall to their death, get shot or are hacked down with a machette=and don't show it!)And their are some long, dull scenes of poeple just swimming and swimming underwater for way long amounts of time that are unhumanly possible.Here's the whole movie in a nutshell: tourist are on a bus in Brazil, it crashes, the american, australian, british and danish tourists get aquianted after the crash, find a beach, drink, get high, dance,one guy sleeps with a girl (only to find out she's a prostitute!), get drugged, robbed and fall victim to poeple who want to cut them open to get their organs. ONE person gets their organs removed, others get shot trying to escape, others get away by these goons all in on this organ thing turn on each other and kill each other. Three of the victims survive and off on a plane home they go. the end. zzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzz.How the heck does hollywood get these poor writers? if they were in college and turned in garbage like this, it would certainly be considered D material.I was disappointed that this film was featured in Fangoria and now question their authority on horror flicks.Want gore? save your $$$$ till XMas and see Black Christmas=This one may save the wave of horror flicks that came out in 2006..Best horror flicks that came out this year?

review/text: A fantastic, hip, and energized look at a young woman (Lola, of course) who must raise 100,000 DM in 20 minutes before her boyfriend Manni, who has to answer to a gangster about a large sum of money that he mistakenly left on a train. Run Lola Run literally runs right from its MTV-inspired opening credits, using a striking mixture of incredible lighting, quick editing, and animation to give a unique feel to late 90s Berlin (it is also a somewhat more optimistic picture of Berlin than the Berlin of Wim Wenders' Wings of Desire, which the film alludes to in its opening moments). The result is three different looks at what Lola's adventure might turn into. Fantastic on every level, the direction is both quickly-paced (perhaps a little too quick in parts) and yet never fails to involve the audience. All of the characters emerge into full people through each "scenario." Incredible as it might sound, however, this film could have used some tighter editing, notably in the (rather trite, it must be admitted) scenes where we learn of Lola's father having an affair with a co-worker. I am unsure of what this subplot brings to the film other than a few laughs. As I said, the direction is tight and quick, but when the film slows, it slows for a reason, revealing character. Lola's flaming red hair will help you keep focused on her running when the camera segues to its aerial shots.

When I heard that soul coughing released lust in phaze, I thought that was a great idea since I did not own any of their albums so I figured that Lust in Phaze would provide a good introduction to the band. After buying and listening to the album. Lust in Phaze covers soul coughing's career from Ruby Vroom to El oso. It also includes unreleased songs like Casiotone Nation peformed live. There is also the song from unmarked helicopters from Songs in the Key of X.Overall, the album provides a really great history of a band that should have been given more attention for its great music.

review/text: I really can't say much more than has already been said about Helen Kane's performance style: it's definitely in the &quot;novelty&quot; category, but nonetheless consistently entertaining and even risque. Irrespective of the voice or the New Yawk accent, she's a darned good singer. The three short years she was famous have influenced listeners and performers for more than 72 years. What a pity that her career died so quickly!The documentation accompanying this CD is excellent, in that it covers her biography, the historical context of her career rise and fall, recording dates, and record matrices. Regarding the sound processing, let me say at the outset that I'm fundamentally opposed to stereoizing monophonic sources. Having said that, I can say that Robert Parker's stereo effects are fairly subtle, and certainly his denoising and equalization are generally quite good (occasionally I think the highs are rolled off a bit too much). The pseudo-stereo effect at its worst add a moderately annoying echo to Ms Kane's voice; the accompanying bands don't seem to suffer nearly so much from the processing. I wish that Parker had not done this; however, he could have done *far* worse.

This is a fun and fascinating look back at a golden age of American popular music and the groups, producers and songwriters who made it happen. Much more than a rehash of the Motown story from secondary sources; the author personally interviewed many of the stars and lesser-known lights who helped create the music we love. Good, crisp writing and a generous collection of photographs bring the Motown story to life. A must-have for anyone who loves Motown or is interested in American popular music.

I axiously waited for this CD to come out and was afraid that I would only like the songs I already knew, which is the case many times when you buy an album - you know one or two songs and when you listen to the rest, you are disappointed. Not so with Clay Aiken. I absolutely LOVE every song. Of course I love Invisible and This is the Night, but the title cut, Measure of a Man, really blew me away! If you find the guy described in this song (like I did), hang on to him. They aren't easy to find, but well worth the effort! I just keep hitting the back button! Then I go ahead and play the whole CD over again. I have a six CD changer in my car, but I don't need the other five slots! It is such an upbeat CD. The tunes are uplifting, as are the lyrics. I Survived You even seems to make breaking up seem not so bad. Whether you are in love now or trying to recover from a break up or just want to feel good, you NEED this CD. Clay, when I say I love you, I mean it!

review/text: Forgettable horror thriller that has Keanu Reeves remaking his matrix role for an even less talented director and an even worse screenplay. Keanu's performance is a worthy effort but is not very good and he's more distracting than compelling in his role. His costar Rachel Weisz does much, much more than he does in the acting department and almost redeems the entire movie with her stellar performance but she's literally the only actor who tries to be better than the horrible script that they had to work with. A script that lacks not only common sense but a sense of purpose as well. The direction is shoddy with really bad camera work in all directions and the special effects don't hold much significance.Other than a worthy and game effort on Rachel Weisz's part. The movie is not worthy of her talent or your time.

review/text: This book is more of an insight into Mr. Golding's view of humanity than it is an insight into humanity itself. Needless to say, Mr. Golding has a very negative view of people. Perhaps his view is colored by the fact that he lived through the development and dropping of the atomic bombs on Japan (atomic bombs are brought up in the book as having hit the airport from where the boy's plane departed) and the rise of Nazism in Germany. Mr. Golding uses a group of plane wreaked boys to tell his tale of what he thinks is the natural denigration of society. Still, I can't find his view at all consistent with the world around us. If savagery was natural for people we would not have developed into a civilized society. In fact, with few exceptions, all peoples form structured societies that impart rules for the welfare of the group; not the other way around as Mr. Golding would have us believe. Except for few notable exceptions (like Nazi Germany) savagery is not natural for people. Even there, civilized peoples prevailed. Additionally, I believe this book has racist overtones in that Mr. Golding chooses to use the jungle motif to display his version of savagery. Why couldn't he use another back drop?Technically good writing gets the book three stars.

review/text: The epic poem that is Beowulf ranks as one of the greatest pieces of literature man has ever produced. When a reader ponders the ideas found within this wonderful work of art the mind simply boggles at the depth and richness running throughout the poem. Glimpses of the old Europe abound in this tale about Hrothgar, Beowulf, Grendel, and Grendel's mother, a Europe of drinking halls, campaigns of conquest, human destiny, and dark monsters creeping through the night. Simultaneously, a reader of Beowulf glimpses the stirrings of Christianity, which would soon overrun all of Europe and put an end to the old ways. Scholars of Beowulf never tire of writing articles and books about this piece of literature and new translations of the work continually appear. If you wish to read Beowulf, and I recommend you do so as quickly as possible, check out the spectacular Seamus Heaney translation. Do not, under any circumstances, watch this cinematic version of Beowulf in lieu of reading the poem. Not only does this movie not follow the epic in any significant way, the film also takes a decidedly B movie approach to the whole topic. &quot;Beowulf&quot; stars Z movie star Christopher Lambert as the enigmatic hero, another point you would do well to consider before popping this disc in your DVD player.At some point in the future, in a time never elaborated upon by the filmmakers, a fortress stands watch on the borderland between good and evil. The soldiers in the fort, led by a king named Hrothgar and his right hand man Roland, fight endlessly with a mysterious creature who shambles out of the dark each night to claim a new victim. The garrison rapidly diminishes under the onslaught of this malevolent apparition until one day a man rides up to the fort claiming that his destiny involves fighting evil. This man is Beowulf, played with mind deadening woodenness by a bleach blonde Christopher Lambert. The men manning the fort are naturally suspicious of this new arrival, but after Beowulf fights the creature to a standstill the men are more accepting of his presence. In no time at all, Beowulf antagonizes Roland, wins the admiration of Hrothgar, and catches the eye of the king's busty daughter Kyra. The killings continue unabated until the big showdown between Beowulf and Grendel, the name of the being haunting the soldiers in the castle. A further surprise appears in scenes involving Hrothgar's dream encounters with a mysterious blonde apparition, a woman who has something to do with the death of the king's wife and who eventually plays a big role at the end of the film.Initially, I warmed to &quot;Beowulf.&quot; Despite Lambert in the lead role, most of the actors did a better than expected job in their roles. The gorgeous Rhona Mitra did an adequate turn playing Hrothgar's daughter. Charles Robinson, who played Mac on &quot;Night Court,&quot; does as much as he can in the role of the fort's chief weapons master, and the actors playing Hrothgar and Roland did acceptable work as well. The set pieces looked better than average for a B movie, as did the armor and weapons used by the characters. The movie starts with a nice fight scene between Beowulf and a small army outside of the fort, and this too gave me hope that the movie would rise above my original expectations. As the movie wore on, I discovered my interest waned considerably. The CGI effects used for Grendel and his mother looked cheesy and uninteresting, and Lambert's portrayal of Beowulf tended to grate after the first thirty minutes. The soundtrack contributed greatly to my sense of irritation. The filmmakers saw fit to imbue this project with a booming techno beat, and used it every chance they got whether the scene called for it or not. Sometimes this music does work, but far too often it distracts and annoys. To keep boredom at bay, I began to count how many times Beowulf executed fancy back flips during the combat sequences. In fact, it seemed that the only thing Lambert's character did after awhile was jump around, strike poses, and mutter cryptic phrases about the evil in the fort. As the final credits rolled, I knew I had just finished watching a typical B movie stinker.The &quot;Beowulf&quot; DVD is far from a bare bones sort of release. There is a trailer for the film, along with additional trailers for films like &quot;Scream 3.&quot; A short behind the scenes featurette is also available. The movie itself looks good for a low budget bomb, and you should still have a good time watching the nice looking women in this movie even if you cannot stomach the lousy dialogue or abominable special effects. &quot;Beowulf&quot; is a must see for those who get a kick out of science fiction cheese films or fans of Christopher Lambert, but all others should stay away.

A fat ugly girl turns into a skinny and beautiful after seeing Hitch in a Pimp My Ride attempt and ends up on The Bachelorette where a weirdo bachelor shoots off the loser opponents and ends up marrying her. There are many funny scenes in the movie, like the cat that takes a dump and the Michael Jackson scenes. The plot is so stupid. This movie is so stupid, that I guess it was pretty funny.

review/text: I read this book shortly before the first anniversary of 9/11. I was truly inspired by the stories of how ordinary people rose to the occassion at a time of great need for our country and our world and prayed that our current generation would have the courage and fortitude to do the same. However, the writing style of Brokaw left much to be desired. His passages too often read like the overly earnest writings of a young English Lit major. However whenever the book returns to the actual words and recollections of the veterans, my spirits soared. Definitely worth reading for the example this generation put forth for all of us to follow.

The shapes stay in their places well and the realistic animal sounds are a nice change from the ordinary toys. I love the activity center on the back because it's like having two toys in one.

review/text: It may be hard to believe that there were classic family films created in the 60s by anyone other than Disney. This movie is an example of a very good and classic family film, one where the only car chase is after a lion, there are no video games to be seen anywhere, and the central themes of the movie are love and that wild things should live free.This movie is based on a book by Joy Adamson by the same name, and chronicles her and her husband's experiences with a trio of lion cubs. Eventually two of the cubs are sent to a zoo, but the third lion, a lioness that Joy calls Elsa, remains with Joy and her husband George. Of course, lions are wild animals and they can live with people for only so long, and Joy is faced with the need to have Elsa sent to a zoo. Joy is unable to think of Elsa being caged when she has been free for her whole life, so she attempts what had not been done before, repatriation of a captive lion back into the wild.Elsa and her husband work long, hard and with a lot of frustration, despairing that Elsa would never be able to go back to the wild, or that she would die as a result of their attempts. All along the way you can see Joy Adamson's love for Elsa and her need to see Elsa be able to return to the wild.Andy Williams sings &quot;Born Free&quot; to accompany the end of the movie. This song is one of Andy Williams' best. If you are familiar with this song you will recognize portions of it are used throughout the movie as a recurring theme.This movie is simple and heart-warming. There are a few moderately violent scenes, but I would consider this movie appropriate for children of all ages, though with parents watching when the youngest family members watch. This kind of movie is rare in any age, and one to be treasured.

Lucy suggests that he direct the Christmas play, but it doesn't seem to be helping. Can Charlie Brown find the real meaning of Christmas?This is an absolute holiday classic. I can remember watching this every year when it was on, and today it never fails to put me in the Christmas mood. It's really amazing how well this stands up, even though the animation is far from perfect and some of the references are out of date. (Aluminum trees anyone?) Still, for me, that's part of the charm. All the characters are true to their comic strip personalities, making for some very funny lines and moments.Also included on the DVD release is It's Christmas Time Again, Charlie Brown. This second special is an animated collection of some of the Christmas themed strips from the late 80's. There's no single story and it's not as charming as the first, but I enjoy it and its great moments. (&quot;Hockey Stick!&quot;)The DVD offers no extras beyond these two Christmas features, but the picture quality and sound are excellent.This DVD is a must for all Peanuts fans, but belongs in the library of anyone who enjoys Christmas specials so it can be enjoyed year after year.

A girl who is not wanted by anyone but the nanny, loved only by her grandparents discovers an escaped German pow. She has to make a choice of either helping him or turning him in.

review/text: In this uniformly clear and incisive volume (the third in Brand Blanshard's landmark trilogy in defense of reason), the twentieth century's greatest philosophical rationalist carefully examines the claims of religion in the light of reason (including its claims that something other than reason may provide an ultimate standard of truth). Entering sympathetically but critically into the thought of great religious thinkers in the Roman Catholic and Protestant traditions, Blanshard concludes that whatever legitimate content religion may have, the claims of reason as ultimate arbiter of truth cannot be compromised.This conclusion does _not_, Blanshard insists, remove the whole of religion. He conceives religion as the response of the "whole man" to whatever he regards as ultimately true and important, and he finds much in Christian tradition that is worthy of a rationalist's praise. And in the volume's final, positive section, "A Rationalist's Outlook," Blanshard sets out in detail what he thinks we may and may not accept from received religious tradition.The concept of "God" is one that he finds we must at least attenuate; he finds that while he can profess belief in an "Absolute" (roughly, all of reality regarded as a logically and causally coherent whole), this Absolute does not share enough features with the "God" of traditional theism that Blanshard feels able to retain that word as a description of his own quasitheistic belief. Nevertheless he also does not argue for scrapping the concept completely, and his disagreements with more traditional theists are always presented with the utmost generosity.Despite its fairly explicit focus on Christianity, this brilliant work also presents a model for budding nontheists in other traditions who seek to take a similarly sympathetic-yet-critical approach to, say, Judaism or Islam. For Blanshard, the primacy of reason does not involve wholesale rejection of religion as inherently "irrational." Indeed, he concludes that reason, properly conceived, has been the unadmitted architect of religion all along, and that taking it seriously is precisely the way to transform our world for the better.Blanshard, in short, takes the service of reason as his own religion. His thorough account should be read by anyone who takes either reason or religion with the seriousness such topics deserve.

review/text: The Witch of Blackbird Pond, by Elizabeth George SpearReview by a Cutchogue East studentImagine living on the beautiful, tropical Caribbean island of Barbados. Being the Heiress to your grandfather's sugar cane plantation would mean no work, all play. Life would be great, swimming in the warm waters all day, being free to read one of the many books that your Grandfather owns right? You wouldn't have to clean either, with your many slaves. In most homes in the 1600's, a 16 year old would be expected to perform many tasks like cleaning, sewing, and cooking. This is how Kit Tyler's life was, perfectNever in her life did Kit have to do backbreaking work. She would soon find out what it was like on the other side. Due to an unfortunate situation, Kit is forced to leave her home on the Dolphin, and head toward her aunt Rachel and uncle Mathew's home in Connecticut. Kit, and her cousins Marcy and Judith work all day, doing the work that Kit considered slave's work.Everything Kit did was the wrong thing in this house. She was even stirring the soap wrong! She was forbidden to help a sweet old widow named Hanna Tupper with anything because the woman was a Quaker. Kit had gone to see her anyway. Because of this she was accused of being a witch. Hanna Tupper was also accused of witchcraft, but Kit managed to help her get away from the angry mob. Hanna's home was burnt to the ground, so she went to live with the mother of Kit's friend Nat.For anyone that's wondering why this Book is called The Witch of Blackbird Pond, it's because Hanna Tupper lived at the edge of a pond, Blackbird pond. In my opinion, this is a great book. If you like realistic fiction books, or books that take place long ago, than you will love this book too.

review/text: Being a male I was never much of a fan of the chick flick, however I usually just accept that women like these movies for the same reasons that men like horror-gore movies (not to essentialize but not many women appreciate this genre). However after seeing this movie I felt compelled to write a reveiw.Basically the plot is somewhat predictable and horribly cliche; enough people ran through it already so I do not beleive that it is my duty. However the most predictable parts of this movie are when she goes to the Italian lovers house and finds out that he already has a woman under his roof. (Perhaps she should have rode back with the officer and then made this movie at least interesting).It is from the aformentioned point that the movie goes seriously downhill. The author found it neccessarey to give this movie a happy ending and amazingly one fell from the sky, with the American author appearing out of nowhere and the deadfully cheesy out of class relationship with the Polish kid and the Italian girl.Overall I recommend this movie if you can forgive movie cliches and random happy endings; well all of that and of course bad acting and fourth grade directing.The scenery was however beatiful, but what a waste.

review/text: El Cielo and Lietmotif were albums for musicians, lovers, and dreamers. They took you places with their lyrics and melodies. El Cielo captured an ambience that few artists ever could.Catch Without Arms, on the otherhand, hardly justifies its purchace. It is weak lyrically as well as musically. they have simplified their sound, while recorded well, there is little feeling or soul in the music. I feel that the band was either pressured by the record company to make music that is easier for the mainstream to swallow, or they simply ran out of ideas. The lyrics sound like rejected Thursday lyrics: "You spitshined my corroded halo." Phrases are often repeated over and over, as if he can't think of anything else to say. When I listen to CWA, I feel that only six songs are worth listening to, at best, but from there, I can honestly say I enjoy only three or four of them. These songs are "Ode to the Sun, Bug Eyes, The Tanbark Is Hot Lava, and Sang Real." Everything else sounds like an old U2 album. If I wanted U2, I would listen to War, not Dredg.Finally listen to the end of the last song, Matroshka. Then listen to Peter Gabriel's "In Your Eyes." Oh my goodness! It sounds the same!

review/text: This meticulous study of the Luftwaffe on the Russian Front during the 1942-1943 debacle doubtless is a major contribution to the genre, but the text is peculiarly dry and remote despite the extraordinary subject matter. Hayward decided to &quot;avoid all unnecessary anecdotes, however fascinating they are&quot; and the resulting narrative, in this reader's opinion, exhibits a curious detachment that is in sharp contrast to the drama of the events he describes.Although it would be absurd to compare this book with, say, a Tom Clancy novel, it also would be fair to say that the text largely fails to capture and reflect the human dimensions of these shattering conflicts. As a substantive work of scholarship it deserves much credit, but it is difficult to know exactly who the intended audience is. I doubt that the general reader of WW II history will read this detailed chronology from cover to cover. The text does not compel that kind of sustained attention.I wonder if all the reviewers who have heaped accolades on this book actually have read it through. It often is easier to recognize virtue than to embrace it...In it's favor, I cheerfully concede that the scholarship appears to be thorough and careful. The abbreviation lists, explanations of German operational units/commands, endnotes and bibliography are quite helpful. I assume that the technical accuracy is beyond reproach. Possibly it is the best and most accessible English-language chronology available to serious scholars of these actions.The problem here seems to be that a meticulous and dispassionate chronology of military engagements, movements of units, and casualty lists, written after the fact by distilling details from primary sources, is not a full history. It is an essential part of the historical record, to be sure, but it is two-dimensional. The total experiences of the Luftwaffe on the Russian Front cannot be so neatly described because the conflict was not neat and tidy. War is a desperate enterprise: quirky, unpredictable, savage, gentle, brave, cowardly, wise, foolish, loving, hateful, and essentially incomprehensible. In short, it subsumes the full, rich tapestry of the human experience.In Hawyard's book we have the melody, but by his choice the harmonies are missing. If one contrasts this text with Bruce Cattons' extraordinary series of Civil War studies, or with Evan Connell's brilliant and evocative biography of George Armstrong Custer in &quot;Son of the Morning Star&quot;, one is struck by the difference between history as art and history as an actuarial record.Reading Hayward's precise, accurate, and aseptic text seems, to me, like watching a skilled neurosurgeon perform a difficult operation: Technically impressive but emotionally absent. The men on both sides who struggled and died here largely have been overlooked, subordinated to the sanitary recounting of operational details. They deserve more.As a different approach to the historiography of this conflict, one might wish to read &quot;Citadel: the Battle of Kursk&quot; by Robin Cross (Sarpedon, c1993).The index is very poor. The large number of undifferentiated page references make it, in part, useless. For example, under &quot;Hitler, Adolf&quot; we find over 60 page numbers or page ranges strung uselessly together. Similarly, under &quot;Richthofen, Wolfram Freiherr von&quot; we find 42 page numbers/page ranges en bloc. Under &quot;Fliegerkorps VIII&quot; 56 page references are clustered together. Undoubtedly this makes for a shorter index. But, as Einstein once remarked, &quot;Everything should be made as simple as possible, but not any simpler.&quot;The Luftwaffe campaign in the East reflects all the intrinsic contradictions, strengths and weakness, brilliant successes, tragic failures, and unparalleled human cost, of this titanic conflict between two profoundly antagonistic world views. If Hayward's text represents the high-water mark of scholarship regarding Luftwaffe actions on the Eastern Front, the fully-fledged, three-dimensional account of this unprecedented carnage remains to be written.

review/text: This is a review for the ORIGINAL release of the book, not the reprinting...A majority of the writing seemed to be written by a child. Some stories aren't finished - on purpose - but its annoying, others are just down right silly. But then there are a couple "classic" stories, like famous urban legends that make up for some of those bad stories. In the end I'm disappointed in this book. I have such fond memories of it from my childhood, it's a shame I don't feel the same way about it anymore.For a more in depth review please visit my horror movie/book review blog in my profile

review/text: Too bad there is not a rating of MINUS-stars. This film is garbage; boring, pretentious, and meaningless. Perhaps other reviews can attach their own fantasies and for them this DOA film may say something. But I found it an irritating waste of time. When a script and the characters within it have no definition, no relevance, and no entertainment value - watching it becomes either self-torture or an exercise in pretending that it serves some arty vision. This is the only time that Mel Gibson let me down. I understand he donated his services to this production and, in that case, he was very much overpaid.

review/text: Reading a book that is both erotic and literary is always a treat. Alma Marceau's Lofting is one of the most exquisite erotic novels ever written. As fiendishly graphic as it is beautifully philosophical, Lofting chronicles the unraveling of a woman's electrifying sexual desire. She has decided to surrender her body to her master, but little did she anticipate that she'd end up surrendering her heart...Lofting is full of wonderful imagery and poetic undertones. To describe this novel as erotic is putting it mildly. It is an extraordinary piece of work, beautiful and lyrical. There are some humorous moments as well. Are you in the bargain for literary erotica? I suggest you pick up this incredible book.

review/text: Usually, a CD like this would meet with at least some approval from me. Inoffensive, fairly upbeat, and with some pretty lyrics...if this was from an unknown, struggling artist, it would be acceptable. But from Clay Aiken? The man who almost won American Idol and who is supposedly (at least to some) the best singer in the country? No, I'm sorry to say that coming from such a person, this CD just isn't enough.As said, there is nothing really terrible about &quot;Measure of a Man,&quot; but nothing really great, either. It is all sort of vaguely nice. I listened to most of all the songs on this CD, and it's telling that that not a single one &quot;jumped out&quot; at me. On a good CD, I will often listen to it the first time and certainly not memorize every song, but know the ones that I definitely want to listen to a second time. But everything on &quot;Measure of a Man&quot; kind of blends. It's all &quot;kind of pop&quot; and all mildly schmaltzy love songs. To make matters worse, I didn't get much of a &quot;feel&quot; for Aiken's voice-most of the time the cliche upbeat background is drowning him out.If you like this sort of genre, try Josh Groban. Yes, he's a little different from Clay-more &quot;classical&quot; and less mainstream-yet his voice is stunning and his material usually shows it. Yes, bubblegum pop such as this may be fine, but why settle for it when there are better &quot;musical sweets&quot; around?

review/text: Edgar Rice Burroughs will always be remembered first and foremost for his creation of Tarzan, but it was the character of John Carter, who first appeared in "A Princess of Mars" who truly served as a template for other science fiction writers. From Lin Carter's "Green Star" series to John Norman's "Gor" books there are tales of the man from Earth traveling to a strange new world and having wondrous adventures. John Carter was a gentleman of Virginia who finds himself looking at his dying body in an Arizona cave. Opening his arms to the planet Mars, Carter is suddenly whisked to the Red Planet, where rival tribes battle while the planet's atmosphere continues to dissipate. Captured by a band of six-limbed giants, Carter soon earns their respect for his prowess as a warrior and forges a lasting friendship with Tars Tara&#8217;s of the Tharks. But then the Tharks attack a fleet of airborne vessels and capture Dejah Thoris, the Princess of Helium, the greatest city on Barsoom (as the Martians call Mars). Of course, they get off on the wrong foot, since Carter knows nothing about the culture of the red humanoid race. But the lovely Princess of Mars has captured the Virginian's heart. Abandoning dreams of returning to Earth, he wants nothing better than to win her love. In the meanwhile, he has to protect her from the amorous attention of the depraved ruler of the Tharks, bring some semblance of civilization to the barbarian tribes, and stop all out war between the green men and red men from ending Barsoom's last chance for survival."A Princess of Mars" is the first of eleven novels in Burroughs' Martian Series, which seemed to avoid the pitfalls of some of ERB's lesser Tarzan novels. If Dejah Thoris is not the most beautiful woman in the history of fantasy and science fiction, then she certainly has the all-time best name. John Carter is able to take advantage of the Red Planet's lesser gravity to do great feats of leaping about, but it is his innate intelligence and intense sense of personal honor that make him almost idealistically noble. When I first read every ERB novel I could get my hands on in Middle School, Tarzan was always Tarzan, but there was something about John Carter that somehow made him the greater hero in my eyes. Maybe it was the way he handled a sword or how he was always determined to make Barsoom a better place that made him seem Burrough's finest creation. Certainly you will find ERB's most imaginative work, including the great game of Martian Chess, in this series. Do not stop at the first book, because while these novels are fast approaching being a century old, they hold up much better than the writings of Jules Verne or H. G. Wells.

review/text: As a member of a public school board of education, one thing I look for is parental involvement. I like to see large crowds at school board meetings. This book is a valuable guide for parents of children up to 8th grade. Bennett stresses parental involvement. Parents should get to know their childrens' teachers and inquire about the content of the curriculum. Much of the book sets forth what children should learn in each subject area in each grade level. I found the chapter on social studies particularly interesting because that is the subject area where &quot;multiculturalism&quot; and revisionism can most water down the curriculum. Clearly, we should not white wash warts in our past, but we should teach history in a positive manner, while recognizing that no culture, including ours, has a perfect past. We should teach our commonality as citizens without over empahsizing our differences. Parents should know what is being taught in schools and, where children are not being taught what children should know, the parents should be active in correcting the matter.Bennett points out that the home, as well as the school, should be a center of learning. He gives examples of activities that parents can do with children to increase their learning. He also discusses dealing with difficulties that may arise in schools, such as disciplinary problems, etc. This book also discusses innovative and controversial issues such as charter schools, home schooling, how religion should be addressed in our schools, etc. I highly recommend this book and hope that it will spur parents on to close involvemet with their children's education.

review/text: You can judge a film by the company it keeps, and amazon's always spot-on recommending technology tells me that fans of 'Nowhere in Africa' are also interested in the following current releases: Hotel Rwanda; A Very Long Engagement; Bad Education; and Million Dollar Baby. Since I've seen and am enthusiatic about each of those, I'd like to suggest that fans of any of those films check out 'Nowhere in Africa,' which is richly deserving of its 2002 Academy Award for best foreign language film.Pay no attention to other critiques on this page about needing to understand German, or about not being able to understand the subtleties of the dialogue because it's not in English. That's hogwash. The subtitles here are excellent, as is the acting, most notably by Juliane K&ouml;hler and Merab Ninidze as lead protagonists Jettel and Walter Redlich. These are great actors who skillfully portray every nuance of their actions and feelings in a way that transcends any language barrier.My only complaint is that director Caroline Link could have been a bit more judcious about the editing process. At 2 hours 21 minutes, the film feels about 15 minutes too long and drags at stretches. That's a small quibble in the face of the overall quality of this production.

review/text: My Apple charger broke and I needed to buy a new one. Thinking it was ridiculous to spend $80 on a charger, I went with this Macally charger. I read most of the reviews here on Amazon, including the one and two star reviews from people who said the charger didn't work and, when plugged in, oscillated between charging and not charging the computer. I figured they might have received a dud and decided to try my luck anyhow. I have now received two of these items from Amazon both with the same problem. When I plugged it in and was using the computer at the same time, the power oscillated between charging and not charging every second or two. When I put the computer to sleep or turned it off, it seemed to charge the computer. Anyhow, after having the same problem twice, I decided to shell out the bucks for an actual Apple charger instead of having to deal with the annoying charger and keep sending them back and forth to Amazon.I do believe, however, that this charger fried my computer's battery. After using this product a few times, hoping I could get it to work, the battery meter would read 70% charged but the computer would just shut down because, in reality, it was not charged. The guy at the Apple store said that I would have to replace my battery eventually but that the charger probably helped speed that process along.Anyhow, I am now poorer from having to purchase both an Apple charger AND a new battery, but now I'm happy that I can actually use my laptop! I would not recommend this product to anyone not only for the inconvenience of having to deal with a faulty product but also because it can actually mess with your laptop.On a side note, Amazon returns were GREAT. Very efficient...I have not had any problems with them. They even sent me the replacement product before I had a chance to mail back the first one. Something I was not expecting at all.

review/text: BALONEYI'm glad the overall rating for this film is 4 stars. I say, Baloney, to the nitpickers. This is a very, very fine film that treats both the facts and the book upon which this film is based with accuracy and sensitivity. There's nothing wrong with the long final scene with Patton talking non-stop while lying in a hospital bed. In some ways, that is more about the true Patton than the image of him barking out orders. This death scene, in my view, is an achievement in biographical film making. True, some facts in the film were softened, such as Ike's chastisements of Patton, turning the final interview into an austere reprimand rather than the catalysimic destruction of a friendship that it was. And Patton was secretly under observation for signs of psychopathology (good thing our Civil War generals didn't live in the 20th Century!) And Patton was a lot more disgusted with the European Jews--and a lot chummier with the German Regular Army officers, than depicted in the film, but these facts are suggested in the film. And I feel that all of this is okay. Generally speaking, this genre is watched by history buffs, anyway, and we can fill in the blanks. We should all know by now that there's only so much you can do with a two-hour movie. I'll never forget the scene of Patton's wife in a powder blue dress and floppy hat test-driving a prototype tank in front of the mossback Cavalry Generals. By the way, Scott was 42 years old when he performed in the original PATTON. General Patton himself was between ages 59 to 60 during WW2. In this present film, Scott is the same age as Patton was. Good film. Well done.

review/text: This is an excellent and extraordinarily thorough analysis of how the Soviet space program went from the highs of Sputnik and Vostok (covered in the author's first book) to the disappointments of the failed attempts to launch a circumlunar mission or an actual manned lunar landing. If the book is a perhaps excessively detailed and not a light read, I think that's fine, because it also answers the many questions I always had of what REALLY happened during these tense years of the Soviet/American space race. The Soviet efforts were for so long shrouded in mystery and even when revelations came they seemed incomplete. I think this author's strong emphasis on original source material and exhaustive research have been well rewarded. If you want the complete story, this is a must have.

It is slow on the uptake tho thankfully does pick up the pace, but only at the last, and after you have waded through so much extraneous babble that you often wondered where you were headed in the first place---which was, incidentally, a plot to assassinate Churchill and Roosevelt.The book flap summary---and even the design of the dust jacket---made it seem like I was in for a treat.

review/text: Let me resurrect an old cliche & say that "Inquest on the Shroud of Turin" is good news and bad news. The good new is that several of the chapters are very strong, providing compelling reasons to discount the authenticity of the Shroud of Turin as the burial cloth of Jesus. I think the most enlightening chapter was at the beginning of the book & dealt with the provenance of the shroud. It was clear from its origin in 1355 that the cloth was a fraud. The early provenance shows that the only medieval contemporaries who did not discount the shroud as a fake were those who were profiting from displaying it to pilgrims in return for alms. Bishop Pierre D'Arcis wrote an investigation report stating that the shroud is a painting, & this fact was attested to by the artist who painted it. Even the pope discounted its authenticity when he issued a bull directing it could only be displayed as a "representation" and not as an authentic relic. It is amusing to think that the medieval mind had clearer insight into the shroud's bona fides than many modern minds.Another strong chapter is the one that deals with the research of Walter McCrone. (...) In any event, McCrone concludes the shroud bears traces of paint pigment (as predicted by the provenance) & that proteins on the shroud are not blood but rather the paint medium tempra. What do you call a piece of cloth with paint pigment & paint medium on it? McCrone and Nickell conclude that it is a painting (as one might expect).Now for the bad news: "Inquest" suffers from several weaknesses. Many of the chapters become lost in technical detail which I think detract from the strength of the overall argument. Why make a subtle argument when there is an obvious argument to be made that is more compelling? Also, I noted one occasion where Nickell placed emphasis where he should not & the result was misleading. Nickell states that according to the New Testament, the body of Jesus was buried according to Jewish custom, & therefore the body must have been washed. The truth is that the New Testament does NOT say the body was washed. This whole line of reasoning should have been left out in my opinion since it is misleading & detracts from the overall argument.Another weakness is that the book has not been updated since the Carbon 14 tests were published showing that the shroud is only 700 years old. This makes the cloth about the same age as the provenance indicating it is a fake. A new chapter would tie all this together quite nicely.Other reviewers have criticized Nickell for his lack of credentials as a scientist. If they had read the book more carefully (or at all), they would have noted that this book is clearly presented as a collaborative effort with technical specialists. Not only did Nickell consult on research, some whole chapters are ghost written by his collaborators. Another criticism is that the shroud could not be a painting since there is no brush strokes & no directionality. In spite of what other reviewers have said, these matters are addressed in the book. There are no brush strokes because the artist didn't use a brush. Furthermore, Nickell does discuss how paint could be applied without an indication of directionality. Read the book for more details.Finally, there is one interesting argument Nickell touches on but does not develop. The image of the face on the shroud shows evidence of fresh bleeding from scalp wounds. Nickell points out that there should be no blood because the body was washed. An alternative observation is that when a person dies, the heart stops, blood pressure drops to zero, & lividity begins to set in. A dead body simply does not bleed (at least not like the fresh stream of blood seen on the face of the shroud). Hypothetically, if the shroud were indeed the burial cloth of Jesus, it means that he did not die on the cross, but that he was taken down while still alive. No death on the cross means no resurrection, & this conclusion would turn Christian theology on its head. It appears that this one observation would give the faithful plenty of reason to reject the authenticity of the shroud, rather than defend it.

review/text: There a several things I have come to dislike about this book. The first is in the overall treatment of the subject matter. The explanations are incomplete and sometimes you can be left wondering how one equation follows from another. Griffiths also introduces symbols or notations without giving a formal definition of what it is. As a result of this, reading the actual text is usually of no help when it comes to solving the more difficult problems. It is infuriating to look at a problem for over three hours and still have absolutely no clue as to how to go about solving it. I have no problem with very difficult problems that take hours, but I would like to spend the time actually working on the problem, instead of staring at it, wondering where to start or what that notation means that the author never defined. Not recommended.

review/text: The only problem I had with this book was that it seemed to brush over some big ideas. Things would be stated that the author seemed to assume the reader would agree with without delving further into it. But I would still reccomend this book, because it's a great example of the many meanings that can be found in the Torah -- even in just one verse!

review/text: Till you read Steves book the title is wrong. You assume it should be about you and your mate. The truth is it should be called the life handbook and given to every one before the get out of grade school. Only after you read it do you figure out that. The first great relationship has to be with yourself. Even though the book is an easy read I don't want to pass my copy around. I want to buy a case of them and give it to all my family, friends, and coworkers. It should be reread every month.

The display readout could be better, but after it got down to 65 degrees, any adjustment downward, resulted in the same 65 degrees. It was kind of frustrating. besides that, the product worked pretty well.

review/text: Watching this as part of a highschool assignment, the teacher only allowed us to watch about 15 minutes of it. When I saw it playing on cable, I sat down to finish it. This, I must say, is the best version of Romeo and Juliet. In the '68 version The actors are young and even though it was made in '68, you can relate to them in this day. The acting is superb, no one better could have been picked for the parts. It was a real tearjerker. Not to mention the soundtrack...the songs were just amazing to hear. Just watch the movie once, you'll fall in love with it.

review/text: Since discovering Hi Tec some 15 years ago and found it to be the perfect fit for my size 11 feet (womens) I have stuck to the brand for hiking boots. They are stylish, waterproof, well crafted and a brilliant fit for a broad foot. This is a boot you can walk in all day and not have sore feet; I have never had one blister and they require no breaking in. In recent times I have been unable to source this brand in Western Australia, and when I finally found a store that carried them they were twice the price offered by Amazon. And thanks to Amazons sizing chart the mens size 9 translated perfectly. I have yet to be disappointed by Hi Tec which is why I have found it unnecessary to try other brands. The Altitude rates as the best to date. I cannot recommend this boot highly enough.

review/text: I can't say how pleased I am to discover this back in print (I have a rather expensive used copy). I am a huge fan of Charles Williams, and this book is one of my favorites of his, along with the Taliessin poems and All Hallows' Eve-- with the added benefit that it isn't as impenetrable as the Taliessin poems often are. Thomas Cranmer of Canterbury alone is worth (to me) getting the book for, with its sympathetic yet unsparing (even harsh at times-- Cranmer's last scene, ooh) picture of Cranmer mixed with haunting cascading language. Seed of Adam is kind of cool with its rather unorthodox portrayal of Joseph and Adam; The House by the Stable and its sequel are just fun. Terror of Light is perhaps my favorite after Cranmer; the portrayal is just so... right, for example Thomas's rejoicing in rationality and Saul's misplaced (but understood and forgiven) judgmentalism, and Judas's (possibly heretical?) authority even in damnation. The only play I don't love is Judgement at Chelmsford, which is a bit too formal for my taste, with not enough plot, although I'm sure that actually seeing it probably works better than reading it.If you like plays, and you like Williams' other work, then I recommend this. Of course, there are lots of people out there who don't like his erudite and casually-theological/supernatural style, which I do quite understand, and those probably wouldn't like this either. I would also have to say don't read all the plays at once, as he has some language tricks he *really likes*, and reading them three times in a row is a bit tiresome.

review/text: Even though Clay was runner up on American Idol, he proved his talent and ability with this great album. If you like pop/adult contemporary music, this album has something for you. The album starts off with great songs such as &quot;Invisible&quot;, &quot;I Will Carry You&quot; and &quot;The Way&quot;, and the latter two will be singles for sure. The country-pop of &quot;When You Say You Love Me&quot; leads into the almost intense &quot;No More Sad Song&quot;. Then comes the beautiful &quot;Run To Me&quot; and the inspirational &quot;Shine&quot;. This is followed by the great &quot;I Survived You&quot; and Clay's #1 single &quot;This Is The Night&quot;. Then comes a trio of simply wonderful tunes: the glorious &quot;Perfect Day&quot;, the passionate &quot;Measure of a Man&quot;, and the sensual &quot;Touch&quot;. Clay's voice is remarkable on every song, and there truly is something for all pop fans here. Billboard didn't name this the best pop album of 2003 for nothing.

review/text: This is one of those books that you come across in your life that people talk about and mention to you a few times and eventually you get around to reading it. Since it's only about 123 pages long, it is definitely a quick read. The storyline goes at a good pace and there's just enough happening to keep you interested in the plot.Most people I've talked to about this book didn't care for the lack of details. That didn't bother me so much. The only reason that I am not giving this book a better review is because of my frustration with the main character. If Mersault would just CARE about something, anything, the outcome of this story would be so much different. Sure, this is the point the author is trying to get across, but still. I found Mersault's stand-offish attitude to be very frustrating.This is definitely one of those books that you want to discuss with a friend when you are finished, so be sure that if you grab this book, grab another copy for a friend as well.

review/text: This is not for people who try synchronizing "Dark Side of the Moon" with "The Wizard of Oz". Nor is it for those who think "Comfortably Numb" has a "kick-[bottom] solo." Nor is it for those expecting live concert footage of Syd Barrett with the band (although there is a little without sound). It's mainly just shots of Floyd in the studio jamming on "Interstellar Overdrive". The visuals are terrific. In one scene, it shows us rare footage of a Yoko Ono exhibit in which a model has her clothes cut off by scissors. A very interesting look at a very interesting era. However, at just under a half hour, the film leaves much to the imagination. This might be worth it just for footage of Syd, which is hard to come by.

review/text: Cibo Matto's 'Stereo Type A' is an incredible album. Yuka Honda and Miho Hatori are unafraid of exploring all genres of music while still keeping each song original and their own. Their lyrical talent shineso n the triumphant 'Speechless' and 'Sunday Part 1'. 'Flowers'' and 'Llint of love' are disguised as cheesy and cute pop-songs, but are spiked up with deep, thought- provoking lyrics. Cibo masterfully creates each song using an ecclectic mix of instruments from synthesizers to country-guitar to a slamming door. They have definitely matured since 'Viva La Woman.' They're less crunchy and irreverent, more polished and defined. The vocals on this album show that they are truly talented vocalist, beyond excellent singers. I recommend this album to open minded individuals who are sick of the bland, neatly categorized mainstream. Cibo Matto's music sounds effortlessly inventive and original. This is one of the best albums of the year, if not the decade. Yuka and Miho break every stereotype imaginable with Cibo Matto. They write and produce all their own songs (with other two Cibo members, Sean Lennon, Timo Ellis), and play their own instruments. They are ahead of their time and in a league of their own, Stereo-type A is a must in every dj's bag.

review/text: The first season of Sanctuary was so cool and different. It had an aura of mystery to it, and took the viewer into this mysterious world of Helen Magnus and the abnormals and sheer fantasy of the Sanctuary. The characters were intriguing, the writing impressive, and the setting was just so unique. Each episode was like delving into a new mystery each week with intelligent problems that needed solving by the team of well balanced, thought out characters. In the words of Magnus herself from the pilot, "you are about to leave your world behind."Sadly, Season 2 failed to live up to the promise set by Season 1. Instead, Sanctuary Season 2 saw the series turn into yet another hyped up sci-fi action series. If they gave Amanda Tapping back her blonde hair and had her loose the British accent, she could have been playing Sam Carter from Stargate this season. Don't get me wrong-I love all three Stargate series. But this was Sanctuary--something new and entirely different from Tapping's other show and character.The atmosphere of mystery is gone. The weird and unique setting has been entirely normalized. The plot points became ridiculous (the Sanctuary has its own Navy-come on!) Basically, with Season 2, they have turned the show into a "shoot the monster of the week" series. I hate to say it--some of the episodes' stories this season seemed to be taken from Sci-Fi Saturday B-monster movies.Now, that being said, is the show salvageable? Yes. There were still some elements of the show this season to make it palatable. The characters were still interesting (although they need to avoid turning Magnus into another chick with a gun in sci-fi character). There were some very good episodes this season, albeit few and far between. For example--the episode with Magnus and Zimmerman and the crashed helicopter was a great character piece. And the producers already proved they could do a good show with Season 1. They just need to return to the Season 1 formula of the show to save it.I would not recommend owning season 2. If you catch it on a re-run, it would be okay because it is mildly entertaining and you won't be wasting your money. Here is hoping for something better in Season 3.

review/text: Whether or not this band is "brilliant" is entirely besides the point... What the Beta Band are about on these early EPs is HAVING FUN. These are goofy, indulgent, purposefully repetitive psychedelic grooves, music to space out to and enjoy. The End. If that sounds good to you, pick this album up and see what you think. Leave the fanboy "they rock" vs. "they suck" debates to the teenagers, indie nerds and would-be giantkillers who have too much time on their hands and think they have to prove themselves everytime a popular record comes along. If listening to music is more important to you than being part of a "scene" then you might like this a lot.

review/text: "A Soul Haunted by Painting" starring the incomparable Gong Li is one of her lesser publicized efforts, but no less commendable performances as the chinese painter, Pan Yuliang, whose work was largely rejected in China due to its nude content, but adored in Paris, where she ultimately studies and resides. The film follows the arc of her tortured existence, from being sold into prostitution as a teen, to her life as a minor wife of a Chinese Diplomat, to ultimately being posthumously regarded as one of the greatest painters of Chinese descent.The detractions however, are not with this film, but with the quality of this DVD's release, which almost seems to be a copy, of a copy, of a print. Perhaps in some ways not even Gong Li's wonderful career and performance can save Pan Yuliang from what appears to be a continuos disregard, and minimalizing of her abilities and significance. The puzzling quality of this release in this day and age, is most assuredly no mistake.

review/text: I picked this book up after reading a couple suspense stories in a row and needing something a little more lighthearted. What a pleasant surprise! This book had laughs but was so much more. I loved the relationships between the characters. For a change there was actually a hero and herione who did not make me shake my head in disgust. They acted like real people. The secondary characters, Tom and Susannah were well thought out and very realistic. And you just gotta love Pearl! There were several belly laughs as well, particularly the hospital waiting room scene. I laughed so hard my husband starting looking at me strangely. I am looking forward to the next books by this author and I will be searching my book stores for her previous book &quot;Prince Charming&quot;. All in all this is worth your time.

review/text: Who is Francois Pignon?He is a character that Francis Veber has used in many of his films, from La Chevre to the excellent Diner Des Cons, and he appears again in his latest Le Placard/The Closet.Pignon is always a lonely man, separated or divorced, with no friends or social life,accident prone,in short down on his luck, an average man living a dull existence, and invariably an oddity in a society that applauds people with good looks, and success professionally and socially..The very type of people that look down at Pignon and make fun of him..Hero vs anti Hero.This is Francois Pignon and Veber's character in the films should be looked at in this context, regardless if one film is funnier than the other.Certainly Diner Des Cons is funnier than Closet, and if you expect the same laughs then you will look at Veber's latest with less enthusiasm, and appreciate it less. Veber did not intend to repeat the same formula he used in Diner Des Cons, but give us a story about another Pignon, in a different context and situation.There is more poignancy in the Closet,and it is a bittersweet comedy, like the French can only make.The pretext of pretentious gayness to keep his job, is only a backdrop to Pignon's predicament at the hand of society, but it is a very clever insight nevertheless, into the corporate atmosphere and political correctness vs homophobia.Yet what I found very interesting about the gay angle, is how Pignon discovers a strenght and confidence he never thought he had by pretending to be gay.The way his colleagues and family react to him, from ridicule, to excessive friendliness, to pride, (from his own son, thinking it is very cool), is very interesting.The acting I though was very good. Assembling some of the best French working actors today , including Depardieu, Rochefort, Lhermitte and of course Auteuil.He plays Pignon in a straight faced manner..but not boring as some reviewer saw it, because his performance reflects so well the character he is playing. All Pignons are boring! Whereas in Diner Des Cons, Pignon had the gift of talking! even in the wrong moments, saying the wrong things, and entertaining the viewer in the process, Pignon of Closet had deep anxieties, and he shows them.The beauty about Francois Pignon is that he triumphs at the end. He saves the day..manages to make people happy, or clear the mess he put himself or others in, becoming the most unlikely hero. and this is Veber's triumph and with it The Closet.It is a wonderful film, that I hope Hollywood will not remake, because all Veber's american remakes,(Three Fugitives, The Toy, Birdcage) even the ones he directed himself, lose their magic,the magic of Francois Pignon.

I find his book to be biased (towards the Murphy-Dolan faction), poorly researched (claiming that Billy the Kid was known as Michael McCarty), and his findings to be very questionable (presents evidence without veryfiable sources.)After reading this book I asked myself why did Cline write this book? He seems to not think to much of &quot;Billy the Kid&quot; so why write a book about him? Why not stick to your true passion and write a documentary about James Dolan and L.G. Murphy.

review/text: The first time I read this book, as a high school sophomore, I detested it. Now, two years later, being forced to read it over for an English class, I still cannot write that I enjoyed it or found it profound in any way. All I do know is that this time around, though not having taken a liking to the work, I do RESPECT it. I do not see Meursault as any sort of hero. Nor do I completely understand the concept of existentialism. I read many of the online reviews and noticed that many others did not seem to really grasp the concept of existentialism either. The first reviewer asks &quot;Is the protagonist a sociopath..?&quot; That is something I had considered while reading the book. In the Ward translation, page 100, Meursault admits &quot;I had never been able to truly feel remorse for anything.&quot; A sociopath (pyschopath) is one who feels no guilt, one with an underdeveloped super ego. If so, and Meursault is a sociopath, how can he be regarded as a hero, or as &quot;at the mercy of society.&quot; He is responsible for his own actions. People tend to forget that he killed a man and deserved, if not a death sentence, one of life imprisonment. Such a man as he would be a constant threat to society. One reviewer points out that the root of Meursaults name means death. I saw the symbolism, but it annoys me when my friends tell me how much they enjoy the book, yet they have missed such details. I do not see how they can appreciate the book except for on a superficial level. All things considered, I found the book dry and overrated, but am left with a new sense of understanding. Who knows, maybe the third time around I'll give it another star. That is, if I am ever forced to pick it up again.

review/text: The greatest achievement in western literature is now available in a bound version heretofore reserved for second rate "How to" books from the remainder bin. This publisher offers no preface, foreword, notes, or so much as an illustrator's credit for the apt cover; the sole redeeming feature of this tawdry effort. Usually clocking in at 740 pages plus, this version manages to squeeze every word of the masterwork into a nimble 554 pages, thanks to a total lack of margin space or chapter breaks. Laughably, the book's spine does not allow even for this squeezed assembly, so that it arrives splayed and bow-legged, in unintentional tribute to the willowy author perhaps. Under-inked to the point of appearing mimeographed, with serifs giving way on almost every page, this is hardly the version one needs of a book to be cherished and re-visited often.

review/text: When I saw the depressing amount of 1-, 2-, and 3-star reviews for this novel, I had to wonder what had gotten into the general populace. Then I read the actual reviews, and realized something. They are reading this for pleasure, yes - but why in the world to people turn to a classic novel for a fast-paced, action-packed story? (Yes, I quote.)Tess's is a dark tale, a depressing tale, a tale with no perky moments to speak of (seeing as how we all know it'll get that much worse should anything good happen). The language is poetic and ethereal, with descriptions of incredible beauty that I would give anything to have written and an overtone of intense tragedy and ill-fated cruelty. The characters are all conflicted and in turmoil, oppressed by the moral standards of the day, and Tess is likeable, as opposed to Emily Bronte's Catherine Earnshaw, say. I would like to mention that I chose this book to write a ten-page analytical paper on, know it cover-to-cover, and know that it is SO much more meaningfull when one stops to take in the paragraphs that scream, "Pay attention to ME!!!" I would also mention that I am not a college professor. I read this as a high-school freshman, which goes to show that this isn't just a book for the elite.And in relation to all the readers who feel that Hardy is a bad author? I always believe that people who act as though they can write a classic far better than the author really ought to try their hand at writing a story that will survive the ages as well as Tess. Hardy writes in lyrical prose, in similar style to his poetry, and though I completely understand wanting to read "mind candy", I don't understand expecting books accepted as real literature to do the trick. Maybe try a trashy novel first, and read Tess to cleanse the palate.This is, ultimately, my favorite novel of all time. Naturally, I have many more to read, but of all those I have tried, I have never read another that so seamlessly combined luminous tragedy, heartwrending romance, and cruel fate in a novel as beautiful as it is painful.

Difficult to put together (and I have assembled my share of kid's toys), it will not stay together at all. It is challenging (at best) to get the figures in the elevator, and none of the figures with capes will fit - they tend to get stuck halfway up. The elevator also requires the child to turn a little wheel to get it to go up - too difficult for little ones. It requires a degree in engineering to get the little plane to fold up inside the watchtower - very poor and frustrating design. The noises are also weak as are the features (i.e. the trip wire, rockets, the plane). Just a complete waste of money - it is only a couple of weeks old, and it is headed to the trash.

review/text: Kit Tyler's parents died when she was very young, and ever since she has been living with her grandfather in Barbados. When her grandfather suddenly dies, Kit decides to live with her only living relatives in Connecticut. She has a rocky start on the boat trip over. On the Dolphin, she meets a boy named Nat Eaton, the captain's son, a young girl named Prudence Cruff, whose mother abuses her and accuses Kit of being a witch, and a man named John Holbrook, who is going to Wethersfield to be a student of the minister. It all started when Prudence's doll fell overboard and Kit jumps in to get it. In Connecticut, if you float on water, you are considered a witch. She is an outcast from the moment she gets off the ship. With her beautiful gowns and wild manner, she doesn't fit in with her Connecticut, Puritan family. She lives with her Uncle Matthew, her Aunt Rachel, and her two cousins, Mercy, and Judith. Uncle Matthew doesn't welcome Kit at all. He is upset that she didn't write him a letter first, but she didn't tell him that she didn't write because she had to leave right away or else she would have to marry an old man. Everyone at the &quot;Meeting&quot; or church, is shocked of her lovely clothes, and her personality. William Ashby, a boy Kit's age starts to court her, but Judith likes him. Everyone knows that William won't build his own house until he knows who he wants to marry, and everyone knows that he is about to propose to Kit. Everyone, including Judith, thinks John Holbrook is going to propose to Judith, but he really is in love with Mercy and she is in love with him. Kit feels bad about not being able to help the family much, and is very happy when she gets an oppertunity to make wages and teaching school with Mercy. Kit decides to teach the children by putting on a play about a story in the bible. It gets out of hand and Mr. Kimberley, the school master gets very upset and dismisses or &quot;fires&quot; Kit. She runs to the Meadow and there, she meets a Widow Tupper, who everyone believes to be a witch. She secretly becomes good friends with Widow Tupper, and the Widow helps her get her job back in the school, and secretly teaches Prudence how to read. Then a plague sweeps through the town and Kit is accused of doing it! Mercy is close to dying and Judith is also very sick. Kit has to save Hannah Tupper before its too late! When Kit is put on trial she finds her true friends. This story is very romantic, and very exciting. It shows how people care for each other and help each other no matter what. I think this is a wonderful book for all ages, and I hope everyone enjoys it as much as it did.

review/text: I traded it away this morning and there is this great sense of calm in my soul. You see, Revenge was maybe my favorite 360 game. Maybe my favorite racer ever. It was near perfect. Not realistic, but who wants that? Each race was beautiful chaos. That's the problem here. Risk no longer equals reward. Burnout Paradise is the Alien 3 of this series.The most frustrating aspect of this game is you're better off playing it safe to really pushing the envelope. Because, unless you memorize every inch of the CITY (not track like the previous game, here there is no track), you're doomed to catch some pointless extention to a guard rail here, a side mirror on a parked car there, etc. trying to avoid a non-combative car in your way that you no longer can rear end and use as a pinball physics weapon on the other drivers. Nope, here everything is death. Now I'm pro death and like hard games, but the best offense in this game isn't mayhem, it's Sunday driving. Casually drive around without turbo unless you're trying to force a car off the road. It terrible.Marked Man makes no sense because you can't actually LOSE the cars chasing you, they just pop up. So why go fast? Just drive carefully, it's not like time is a factor. Rampage? Again, the enemy cars don't get you 90% of the time, some random bystander does. So why go fast?Maybe that this game's greatest flaw. It's ironically repetitious. The events all feel the same. The cars all feel the same. You just change cars as another time killer (drive to the junkyard) so that you have one that doesn't die on two hits or will spin around in a Stunt event. This formally was accomplished by selecting the car before the race as a menu. MUCH FUNNER! Thanks guys. Given, chasing down cars and crashing them to "earn" them between event is fun... but that's all you do. So again, boring fast and better when it was called Rampage with eight other cars.I like the Technical merits of this game and understand why they felt this was the "next step", which keeps me from giving it a 1. But this game should be a warning like Tony Hawk Underground and Shemue that walking/driving/skating from event to event is not in itself a good game. GTA was good because the mini-games were varied and the stealing/killing/rooming "menu" had it's own charms. Burnout does not for the most part.

That style, a slow burn which ramps up to a hundred-mile-per-hour ending is perfect for post-apocalyptic settings.

review/text: Let me preface this review with a disclaimer: Contrary to what some other negative reviewers of Finnegans Wake have done, I make no apologies to those who enjoyed the book for my ensuing critique thereof. I ask for the merit of this review not to be judged by my opinion of the book, but rather by the validity of my case, and its potential helpfulness to those who are interested in reading the book. Without further ado:A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man was my entry point to James Joyce's oeuvre, and it was a brilliant one. As an aspiring writer, I identified every step of the way with Stephen Dedalus' maturation, both as a person and as an author. Joyce's unforgiving treatment of his alter-ego's (i.e., Stephen's) flaws was refreshing, as far too many writers of autobiographical novels (I'm looking at you, Charles Dickens) present overly heroic versions of themselves as protagonists. I then moved on to Ulysses, which proved to be a serious test of endurance and willpower. What I understood of the book I enjoyed; what I didn't understand of it ensured I'd enjoy it even more the second, third, fourth, and who knows how many more times around.Then came Finnegans Wake--I skipped Dubliners at the time, for some odd reason. To call it a "disappointment" would be like calling Bernie Madoff "dishonest": bluntly put, it was the most regrettable experience of my reading "career". I wanted to like the Wake--I swear, I really did. I wanted to brag about how I'd finished the book reputed as the most difficult ever written, and, to boot, ENJOYED it. But it was not to be. I did all I could, short of using a reader's guide, which would have felt like cheating (plus, I'm of the opinion that a book that doesn't make sense without a companion guide doesn't warrant the effort of reading it with one). I read the whole thing aloud to myself, to make sure I'd catch as many of the subtle phonetic easter-eggs Joyce crammed into the work as I could. I spent as many as five minutes on single pages, trying to make sense of it. I noticed textual in-jokes here and there, and paused in self-congratulation at being able to decode them. But all to no avail. The best part of reading the book was when I finished it.I've heard all the arguments in favor of the book's merit. I've known people who profess to have enjoyed Finnegans Wake. I've heard what Harold Bloom's said about it. But it doesn't matter to me. The fact is, if nobody had told me that James Joyce wrote this book, I'd have scoffed at it and never given it a second thought--and quite frankly, I doubt this book would have ever been published in the first place if it hadn't been penned by one of the world's foremost writers. I was able to discern who the characters of the book were--HCE, ALP, et al.--and there were some portions of the book that seemed like vestiges of logic in a massive sea of insanity. I know how much work Joyce put into Finnegans Wake; I know how many people have praised it; I know that every bizarrely construed non-word and multilingual pun was carefully crafted and is not the gibberish it appears to be. But the fact is, this book made for a largely joyless reading experience, and thus I have no choice but to give it 1 star.I won't deny that this book is the work of a genius--sadly, I'm convinced it's that particular genius' weakest effort. Only one person in the world knows all the secrets of the book, and that person, unluckily, died two years after he finished writing it. Perhaps if I knew the intended meaning underlying every single quirk of this book, I'd like it--I guess that's why Joyce considered Finnegans Wake to be his masterpiece, after all.

review/text: Asimov is often said to have a flat style and to be unable to create credible characters. It's my opinion. And Asimov is never more ridiculous than when he writes about feelings, especially about love (scenes seem to be described by a child or a thinking machine). But this writer is still gifted at setting clever plots every reader will enjoy, for instance in his robots tales (of course do not expect more than a quality entertainment, as often with sci-fi). However, Fondation is not really a clever book ; it is not boring, but it has poor content. You will finish it but probably won't read it again. First problem, it is impossible to believe in psychohistory, which smells like positivist propaganda from the 19th century. And because he has nothing more than an adventure story to tell, Asimov uses all kinds of tricks to grip the reader, including lots of surprises justified by unlikely and twisted arguments, some of which you may find hard to swallow. To conclude, Fondation is a kind of cartoon : a succession of sketches, rather funny but unlikely. If you still absolutely want to read the book, don't read Dune before. As regards depth, writing, and imagination the two books are separated by lightyears.

review/text: I seen this film with high expectations, I've seen all the Batman films, and I liked them all, well, Batman and Robin was...sub-par. Batman and Batman Returns were well done, and Batman Begins could easily compare. Christian Bale is a magnificent actor, after I seen him in "Reign of Fire" and "American Psycho". He did have a little problem with his Batman voice, it was a little too raspy and tough-guyish, but other than that, he was a frightening hero who saved Gotham from a deadly gas.The film has a large and effective cast. Micheal Caine, a great choice for Alfred, brings laughs and a warm heart. Morgan Freeman plays Batman's gagdets man Lucius Fox, who has only a small role, but still great. Katie Holmes plays Rachel Dodson, Batman's close friend and heart's interest. She's pretty good, compared to Kim Basinger and Nicole Kidman. Gary Oldman plays Gordon, Batman's friendly police officer, and does a good job at it too. The Commisioner Gordon in the later Batman films is Pat Hingle, and he wasn't that good. Liam Neeson is awesome as Henri Ducard, Batman's former trainer turned villain. Cillian Murphy played the horrific Scarecrow, but onlyhad a small role, which was dissapointing because it was such an awesome character, and he didn't appear to be defeated, he was electricuted by Rachel and then he was gone from the rest of the film. Too bad.The action was great, great car chase scene, and explosions and things crashing and smashing, and the fighting was good too, except the camera was awkward during fights, making the view close up and weird to distinguish between whats going on and who's getting hurt.Something that bothered me was how it interacted with the first Batman film. In Batman, Jack (the Joker) kills Bruce's parents. But in this, some thug who's name I didn't catch (but it wasn't Jack) kills his parents. And at the end of Batman Begins, Gordon hands Batman a Joker card telling him this is his next villian, but in Batman, Jack doesn't turn into the Joker until later in the film.Overall, an awesome and well-done and well-casted movie!

review/text: Ulysses will get you, if you give it enough of a chance. The first time you read it, it will be difficult - maybe even impossible. The second time you read it, you will begin to suspect that Joyce is actually writing about the contours of your own mind. The third time you read it, your earlier suspicion will prove true as you successively laugh, gasp, swear, snort, breathe, moan, think, and yearn in anticipation of the occurrences of these events on the page. By the fourth time you read it, you will realize you never stopped reading it - that even the interlude of years between your first and second reading was only a momentary pause to catch the breath of your life outside the Book; and that you made a habit of the yearly 16-June read merely for the sake of ordering that interval of months between the readings - and during those intervals you will find yourself repeating passages in your head that you would never have imagined to be memorizable. Each time you emerge from this book you will find yourself unmistakably changed - your eyes opened to a further deepness of what it is to be human, what it is to be yourself. Joyce will demand everything of you, but he will give you a greater everything in return.If you have tried to read this book before, and didn't make it - well, i understand. The first time, it is admittedly extraordinarily difficult. But turn, if you will, to page 903 of the hardback Knopf Everyman edition, and read the bit of catechism &quot;What in water did Bloom, waterlover, drawer of water, watercarrier returning to the range, admire?&quot; that extends through 905. Then go to the beginning, or wherever you left off if you prefer, and start again. If not now, then someday - maybe years from now - but do it. And then do it again.

review/text: I got this book shortly after returning from South America and at first glance I was impressed. The cover is decent, the publishing quality higher than expected, and the intro a good start. Unfortunately, the content is a disappointment. I have three main complaints about this volume, and some background will add perspective to these criticisms. I have been keeping and breeding poison frogs of the family Dendrobatidae for nearly a decade and am familiar with R.D. Bartlett as author of numerous articles for the pet trade. Rather than articles from the hobby, I prefer the scientific literature, journals or texts on various herpetological subjects. I have made nearly a dozen trips to the Neotropics with friends or family in the last 5 years and have seen both the dendrobatids I study as well as over a hundred species of frogs and dozens of species of lizards and snakes.My experiences in Central and South America have led me to conclude that ecotourist guides are ineffective. Whether they are for plants or animals, these guides are geared for people who are somewhat interested in a particular taxon, but relatively ignorant of the species. I have found that ecotourist guides illustrate a limited number of representative animals. This is justified in regions where there are hundreds of species including some new to science. However, the illustrations or descriptive text are so vague and generalized that they can't be used to identify species. The problem with ecotourist guides is that if you necessarily limit the number of species then you need more detail and information to make sure you are identifying the correct subject. However, most ecotourists want, at quick glance, to know what they saw and rarely require great detail. My first attempts to identify birds from an ecotourist guide were frustrating because of the lack of detail. I now travel with detailed excellent bird guides from various regions. I have been awaiting the herp equivalent of these books but the Bartletts' ecotourist's guide falls well short of the mark.The information offered is vague, downright silly, or wrong. For each animal there is a species account that includes size, identifying features, voice, reproduction, similar species, habitat/range, and comments. Size is a generalized descriptor but it frequently does not help in distinguishing between similar species. Identifying features usually state the obvious but after reading a number of these one gets the impression that an animal could not be identified based on what the Bartletts have written. Voice descriptions are useless. Frogs usually call in mixed species choruses so one would have to have a calling animal in front of them to ascertain what it sounded like. Many frogs quiet themselves upon human approach so it would take patience to catch a frog species calling. I don't believe the average `ecotourist' would make that effort. The calling description is also difficult to use. What is a "series of peeps", "two syllables often repeated", or "repeated buzzes"? The habitat/range info is equally useless. Take this quote from Platemys platycephala: "Although essentially aquatic, twist-necked turtles wander far overland during the rains and when water levels are high. They may be left high and dry as the waters recede." Does this mean one can find this turtle anywhere in the entire Amazon basin? Numerous ranges are listed as primary, secondary, or edge habitats or entire countries. Well of course! I guess it wouldn't be in the book if it didn't occur in the Amazon!Ah, but then that would be an incorrect assumption. Dendrobates azureus and D. tinctorius are poison frogs inhabiting the Guiana shield of South America. This geographically distinct region from the Amazon consists of a massive up welled landmass on the northern edge of South America. Take the following account of D. azureus. Voice: "Males produce easily overlooked peeps." The call of a male D. azureus is actually a soft buzz much like the electronic ballast of a fluorescent light fixture. Similar species: "Some dyeing poison frogs (D. tinctorius) are quite similar in color, but they usually sit in a more erect posture and often (but not always) have at least a little yellow on the back." Are the Bartletts suggesting that posture is an identifying characteristic of these species? They seem to think so, as they repeat that stance shortly thereafter under the account of D. tinctorius. Habitat/range: "This poison frog has become quite uncommon over much of its original range and is now found in isolated pockets of pinelands and surrounding rainforest near the Brazilian border in Southwestern Suriname. Of difficult access, this region is technically somewhat north of the actual delineation of the Amazon Basin but is drained by several rivers that do terminate in the Amazon." What exactly was the original range of this species? Difficult access to be sure. An expedition to collect this extremely rare species a few years ago was restricted as the local indigenous community controls the area. This region is not in the Amazon proper, but even more glaring is the Bartlett's stated reason for inclusion that the region has rivers that drain in the Amazon. Aside from the absurdity of that argument most of this region's rivers, the Sipaliwini included, flow north and drain into the Atlantic Ocean. So why are D. azureus and D. tinctorius included in this book? I can only conclude that they make pretty pictures, and like much of his dendrobatid section, are based on their popularity in the pet hobby.The entire dendrobatid section of this guide is filled with errors. The indigenous people of the Amazon did not use these frogs to "concoct a potent toxin from these compounds with which they coat darts and arrows." Only the Noanam&aacute; and Ember&aacute; Choc&oacute; Indians west of the Andes used frogs for poisoning darts. Most Amazonian hunting poisons are made from plants. The Bartletts frequently start to use locale as a defining characteristic for species but then lists the range as so wide, such as southeast Peru, that species overlap makes this technique useless. In fact they give no range for Dendrobates imitator and to beat that they include an incorrect photo of it. The Bartletts list the range of D. castaneoticus as Northeast Brazil (!), which is a massive area. Caldwell's description of the species specifies a much more restricted region. Under D. quinquevittatus they again say to use range to distinguish it from D. ventrimaculatus, yet the two species do have range overlap. They include an incorrect photo of D. quinquevittatus. They state that D. reticulatus are arboreal and while they are capable of climbing most hobbyists and field biologists know that they prefer a terrestrial lifestyle. Most of his accounts on Dendrobatids seem based on their, or others', hobby/pet trade experience. Many of the poison frog photos are of captive specimens. I wonder why they relied on these instead of in-situ shots of these animals if they were as widely traveled as they claim.The Bartletts' vague mentality carries on in nearly every aspect of this book. Take the species account of Hyla leali. Bartlett calls it a non-descript frog that can most reliably be identified by what it is not (?!). There are hundreds of species of hylid frogs in the region. His photo of it is a Hyla brevifrons. Writing of vipers, they state that captive Bothriopsis bilineata can kill a lab mouse quickly. They remark repeatedly that nocturnal vipers are more prone to bite after dark. Obviously these comments are fluff and seem to be just words to fill the spaces; perfectly meaningless for identification or natural history.The errors go on. I thought of listing them but there are simply too many to include here. Not to mention that I'm not being paid to correct the Bartletts' mistakes.My last critique is of the photos. They are generally good and usually catch the identifying characteristics of the frogs, but the print quality is poor. It seems as if someone went bonkers with the hue/saturation settings in Photoshop, as many of the bright colors come off as garish and inaccurate. Some appear as if printed with a color laser printer. Nonetheless, the photos are the only useful part of this book. In fact this book would be more useful if it were just a collection of photos with species captions. That could certainly limit the number of inaccuracies.The authors present themselves as Amazonian experts but after reading through this work it seems they just made a number of trips to the Iquitos region, taken a bunch of photos of the region's herps (as indicated by the location captions), and decided to publish a book. I would guess that many of the animals were identified for them; otherwise some research would have produced a deeper knowledge. The topic seems broader than their experience and their facts and natural history information come off as made up or based on limited dealings with the animals. They certainly could have benefited from delving into the literature on ranges, natural history, and other details that scientists have been documenting for years.If you have herp experience or are serious about these animals then I can't recommend this book. It is inferior to Rodriguez and Duellman's, Guide to the Frogs of the Iquitos Region, Amazonian Peru, and Dixon and Soini's guide to the Reptiles of the Iquitos region. This book does have more photos, some of which prove useful in identifying animals. But if you were to take the Bartletts' advice and travel to the region with any of the South America tour companies, many with herp experts, then those experts will likely identify the animals for you free of charge.

review/text: Here Kevin Phillips combines three modern political trends into a very compelling historical analysis. This includes America's ignorance of growing problems in energy resources, religious and political fundamentalism, and national debt. These three troublesome scenarios are covered in plenty of other books that deal with one of them exclusively. Phillips goes through each a little more sketchily than they deserve, but he has a winning sense of historical developments, in that these same trends were evident in the collapses of previous Western empires. The parallels that Phillips finds with old imperial downfalls are extremely worrisome for the thinking American, and he provides plenty of strong historical and statistical evidence. This entails the current administration's severe ideological addiction to oil, the influence of a growing conservative religious lobby on social and military policy, and an economy focused on credit and investment rather than manufacturing and development. Plus a governing style controlled by yes-men, a pandering to conservative extremism, and bombastic military hubris. This is an effective thesis from Phillips, and he has added credibility as a knowledgeable and informed Republican strategist.But while this book's conclusions are solid, there are some flaws in the way Phillips put his triple-pronged thesis together. Part I, about oil and energy policy, is thin and perfunctory, and is mostly quoted from stronger books on that subject (such as the masterful works of Paul Roberts and Michael T. Klare); while Phillips commits one severe oversight in forgetting about the massive subsidies enjoyed by the fossil fuels companies, which keep them artificially profitable and entrenched in the status quo while also unfairly holding back alternative technologies. Part II, in which Phillips analyzes the growing influence of Southern religion and culture on national politics, is the strongest and most chilling section of the book. We find that Southerners have now nationally fomented their culture of good/evil indignation, myopic millennialism (why talk about long-term social and economic policy when the Rapture is just around the corner?), and fundamentalist hostility to Church-and-State issues and world politics. However, Phillips misses the point that the Bush administration mostly coddles this coalition for the votes, and his mini-hypothesis about the Christian Right's collusion with the oil and credit industries is a bit of a stretch, socially and religiously. Part III focuses on the looming collapse of the American economy due to ballooning debt and speculative bubbles, and this portion is terrifyingly informative, though rather tiresome as Phillips tries to prop up the argument with a parade of repetitive statistics.In general, Phillips is really on to something here, and while the book is occasionally alarmist, the open-minded reader will see that there are real cautionary tales in his historical analysis. However, the overall three-part political philosophy just doesn't quite come together. But still, anyone concerned with America's future direction will be considerably swayed by this book's mostly powerful arguments. [~doomsdayer520~]

The album got 5 stars (from me) for the following: Production, Orchestration, Song selection (its great to hear the really OLD songs from the vast Streisand Catalog) and finally for Babs herself. The addition of Il Divo is joke! A Woman of such legendary status, especially with the amount of adoration and respect Babs commands does NOT need help from a group of guys who sound like they're warbling their way through songs. Of course, Babs is older here and her voice does show its age but what can you expect from a DIVA who has spent the last 40+ years singing, producing albums, movies and solid concert tours? Listen and be amazed at how an older Barbra still commands a HUGE presence on stage!Has the album been worth the wait? Absolutely!

At least we lost Creed and now we have American Music Club back. So the universe of music craposity we are living these days has scored two points towards the positive. This is not quite the masterpiece of Mercury or Everclear but still a wonderful record. You could do much worse. The "out of tune" singing is not really an issue. That's part of the charm of Mark Eitzel. Either he's doing it on purpose or just doesn't give a rat's. That's what makes him great. It's punk, dudes! He makes the music he wants to make and sings the way he wants to and plays with some cool dudes. Glad to have Vudi back in the picture. That crazy stuff he did at the end of "Heaven's 10,000 Whores" on Mercury is positively brilliant and that kind of witch-doctor "how'd he do that?!" stuff is back on this record as well. The album does drag a bit in the middle and I can ride in Mark's slow-mo drink-a-thon stylings for hours but it seems a bit much even for die-hards. At least it peps back up towards the end. As far as getting a new fingerpicking style as Captain Vocabulary says in another review, that's just silly. Mark has a great style. Would haved like to have heard more Dan Pearson vocals too. Check out earlier works for some great examples of how well Dan compliments an idiosyncratic singer like Mark. Expand your horizons and buy this record but only after you buy Mercury first.

In the space of five minutes, U. S. Naval Aviators sunk four Japanese Aircraft Carriers, destroyed over 300 enemy aircraft and, more importantly, killed most of the elite Japanese Flying Corps. It was the first major reversal for Japan in World War II and marked the turning point in the Pacific. Japan was never again on the offensive after this battle.

review/text: After reading the book I was completely disgusted, the author starts by saying that the Essenes knew more about prayer than the bible Even though the bible says the same things as what points to in the dead sea scrolls then he thinks a group of Hindu's would know even more than the dead sea scrolls say. Though the dead sea scrolls haven't changed in 1,500 years then he makes several extremely obvious errors 1: the Hindus don't teach out of there copies of the dead sea scrolls, 2: If they did learn from the dead sea scrolls they show no evidence for it A: if they did learn anything from it it would have made them think 'well we've learned truths from these Essenes this is making me question my religion.' B: assuming, again, they learned from said scrolls wouldn't the years of teaching generation after generation of those teachings the time passing would have altered the teachings as he says it has for western religion. In fact he never asked them were they learned there method of prayer.Further he often confuses meanings for example we are taught, in the bible, to pray whole heartedly to pray with all thy heart might and mind, while Gregg says pray with your thoughts feelings and emotion aren't the last two the same? YES! they are you feel emotions!Their are better books out there which you not only get what you ask for (if its right) but also sensitize you enough to hear God!Those books are as followsRECEIVING ANSWERS TO OUR PRAYERSPrayers That Bring Miracles

review/text: I bought this to supplement an aging Salton Hot Spot model. The Salton worked okay, but I needed a second warmer. Unfortunately, the Mr Coffee produces disappointing results. Hot coffee becomes warm coffee on this unit. Being a forensic engineer, I was prompted to do some testing to determine what might be the problem.Both units were tested unloaded (i.e. with no cup), and then loaded with a ceramic mug filled with room temp water. Here are the stats:Salton: 23 watts, 260 deg-F unloaded temp, 245 degree with full cup.Mr. Coffee: 17 watts, 226 deg-F unloaded, 180 degree with full cup.So it appears that the Mr Coffee is a bit underpowered--it has a lower (albeit safer) starting temperature that can't be maintained under load. Once loaded, the surface temp is too low for useful heat transfer. Perhaps the Salton's design was guided by an engineer, while the Mr Coffee was guided by an attorney.

review/text: I originally purchased this book when I became a competition team member for the trial advocacy program at my law school. When I thought about an objection that I could make, or that would be made against my case I turned to this book. I would turn to the objection or issue and there would be the relevant federal rule of evidence easily laid out and explained. Most beneficial is the explanation on not only how to MAKE the objection to the court but then how to properly RESPOND to the objection. This book is helpful as I would know how to properly make the argument to the judge/court. It was also helpful to read over/review the book and look at the objections to get an idea of if you could use something else in your case. At the end of the book it also has the complete federal rules of evidence. I can't say more amazing things about this book, BUY IT BUY IT BUY IT!

review/text: The comon view of opera is recitative=drama, arias=music, and therefore not drama. Kerman makes a different (and therefore genuine) claim. he says that in opera the music IS the drama. To illustrate this, he enters a thorough venture in the world of opera, from the first masterpiece - Monteverdi's &quot;orfeo&quot; to wagner and modern operas. The work includes a discussion of the works of such giants as verdi and mozart, and also a critical look at the Leitmotive technics. Kerman is imaginative, provocative, write in a clear language. altough the book demands a background in opera appreciation. It does not demands a musical background. To some it is almost &quot;the bible&quot; of opera understanding. A master achievement.

review/text: This is a totally enjoyable and recommended book. My only problem is that the author as a National Park System ranger does so many dangerous things that cannot be condoned. Please do not follow his example. It is very dangerous to do the following, as he did.1. Hike through the desert without a supply of water. 2. Climb a 13,000 foot peak alone with no one to go for help if needed. 3. Sliding down a 2,000 foot snow slide without proper equipment. 4. Rafting down the Colorado River without a life vest. 5. Descending alone down a canyon for a short cut and getting stuck in a deadly position, with no way to get help. 6. Hiking many places off of established trails all alone. 7. Hiking so far that it requires a more dangerous return in the dark of night. 8. Starting wild fires due to carelessness with pipe smoking. 9. Trying to capture a wild horse all alone and getting run over. This was done while all alone with no possibility of getting help if injured. 10. Drinking water from any available creek, pond or seep. Western water is now dangerous to drink in all western national parks. Treatment is necessary. 11. Eating five eggs and half a pound of bacon for breakfast. Is this the reason he died so young?Many tourists may read this book and follow his bad examples. I wish that he had given more words of caution. Follow the advice of more knowledgeable park rangers. Enjoy this wonderful book but be careful.

review/text: This movie starts out with lots of violent action but no blood. From the start you know you are seeing a video that is like a grade B movie but you keep on watching. Dennis Weaver as Buck is a delightful character and endearing. However there is a lot of Characters and keeping them all straight good guys versus bad guy doesn't take much time, just following the progression of death. Good car chase, good explosions, lots of action but just slightly off balance to be a real quality movie.

review/text: Miserable Keanu Reeves film that is one of the worst movies ever made. Keanu is more than miscast in this film, he makes the film a real chore to watch with his horrible acting and lousy delivery of his lines. This is not his fault because he can be a good actor when he has the right material but he's not working with a full deck here and he's as bad as the film itself. The rest of the film is as bad as he is with a story that makes no sense and direction by music director who does not know the hell he is doing with the movie he's making. Some plot points go no where in terms of furthering the story a long and certain revelations don't makes any sense at all with the overall story. The special effects are not handled well and you really can't see much of the movie at all with how dark it is. Only Rachel Weisz and Peter Stormare do well with what they got and they both make this film bearable with their better than the script performances. Weisz deserves all the praise she is getting for her performance, and that's really because she's does give a better performance than the movie as a whole and Stormare does well with his ten minute cameo and does a better job with his role than most of the actors in the entire film.Now I have not read the comic book on which this film is based on but I hope it's a hell of a lot better than this lousy film.

review/text: I'll add my voice to the paper feed issue. After about a month it has become intollerable. Either it doesn't feed the paper or it jambs. Everytime you print you have to get up to fix something. Being a network printer, it would be nice if you could print from your computer and go get the printout but it isn't that easy. It isn't a paper thing either, I use very good paper (although I don't think I should have to be wed to HP brand everything to use this.) Stay away from this one.I had a problem installing the printer. The help from india did not help at all. The person spent 45 minutes to an hour on the phone with me but clearly could do nothing but read from some manual. I ended up not using their software. You can set up a permanent IP address on this printer and use "add printer" in windows to print to it (ironically, choose "local port", then set up an IP port with the address you chose for the printer.)The software is large and unnecessary, however I did have to install it and uninstall it to get the scanner to work.If not for the paper feed issue, this is a great printer/scanner/copier.

review/text: Patty Bergen lives in Jenkinsville, Arkansas, a little town with a big future. She is Jewish and lives in the time of World War Two. She is constantly insulted and hurt by her unloving parents. At this time her town because a site for a camp that holds German prisoners from the war. Patty meets one of the prisoner boys named Anton and risks her life in hiding him in her own house so that he can escape back to his family in Germany. While hiding him she befriends him more and more everyday and sees the kind-hearted wise, loving man that Anton is, rather than just a "Nazi" like the rest of the world thinks. She realizes that he is the only one in the whole world who truly loves her, that would give his life to save her, as he takes the chance of coming out of hiding to save Patty from being terribly beaten by her father. The author does a good job of showing the closeness that comes between Patty and Anton and the love that they feel for each other regardless of background, family, or what side of the war they are on. I do wish that the author added more events to the story that make the reader even more attached to the characters and their love to each other. The outcome of the story is truly real feeling and has an absolutely stunning end.

review/text: I didn't get very far with this cd series so my review will not be very thorough or technical. But what I would have wanted to know before I made my purchase, is that it is a very regional dialect that is spoken in this cd set (Lebanese, Syrian, Palestinian dialect). Which is fine if that is what you need, but since my husband is Egyptian, I would like to be able to communicate with him and his family in their own dialect. It was actually pretty comical listening to the first cd with him because he kept saying, "What? No, we say it this way..." until we just turned it off.The Egyptian dialect is also more widely recognized throughout the Arab world since Egyptian movies, music, etc. are a big part of Middle Eastern popular culture - so even if you don't have Egyptian family, I think that it would not make sense to learn the spoken Arabic with this dialect - it's difficult enough already!

review/text: This is how Batman is supposed to be. Batman does not arrive in a 4th-of-July-esque hailstorm of flashing lights. He appears, attacks, and vanishes. There should NEVER be a glowing blue bat-mobile. There should NEVER EVER be nippples on the bat suit. That is an atrocity. Possibly a war crime.The earlier films lined up four men too small to be the Dark Knight, and ended up making the films about the villains, not the hero. Batman Begins embraces the darkness spun around the myth of Batman in the decades of comics. Batman isn't cute. Batman punches hard. Bale buries himself in the role, and is the best Caped Crusader to ever play the role.With Bale, Holmes, and an incredible allstar supporting cast (Morgan Freeman, Michael Caine, Liam Neeson, Gary Oldham) who combine for 3 Oscars & another 8 nominations, this is easily the Best Batman film to date, and possibly the best comic book film ever.

review/text: When John Coltrane recorded this album in 1964, he intended it to be a tribte to God; the record is an epic four-part suite, with each of its sections representing a stage in the struggle for spiritual unity with the supreme being. The music is full of passion and power, bulging with internal conflict and meditative grace. 'Trane's playing here is incredible- it's as lyrical as anything Miles Davis ever did, a virtuoso display of emotional resonance and controlled chaos. The rest of the players aren't so shabby themselves: The rhythm section of bassist Jimmy Garrison and drummer Elvin Jones lend the proceedings a surging, driving intensity, while pianist McCoy Tyner radiates angelic slabs of pure melody.Just listen to the band moving through those four sections! "Acknowledgement" wastes no time in setting the tone for the rest of the suite. It's a mini-masterpiece in and of itself, boiling over with passion and intensity. There's pain in Coltrane's playing, but there's also hope and power- he shoots forth whirlwinds of pure, goreous sound, filling the room with pure electricified magic. "Resolution" builds on the template set by "Acknowledgement," which sees the band improvising on a rugged, bluesy theme. This section has an almost film-noir feel to it, thanks to the heavy tension in Coltrane's playing. Next up is the harrowing "Pursuance," which features a volcanic drum solo from Jones. The heavenly, meditative "Psalm" is an ideal conlusion to the record.Simply put, this is one of the greatest albums (jazz or otherwise) ever recorded. No collection is complete without it.

review/text: Every few minutes, I kept saying, "I have LIVED this movie. I have WORKED with those people. I have SUFFERED in that cube farm." And I laughed. I laughed harder than I've laughed at a movie in years. I laughed because it's dark and raw and cynically funny, not because it's what passes for comedy these days (raunchy sex and language that would make a sailor blush--though that can be funny too; see JAY AND SILENT BOB STRIKE BACK for a great example).Mike Judge (of BEAVIS AND BUTTHEAD and KING OF THE HILL fame) brings to life a Dilbert-esque fantasy through the eyes of everyman Peter Gibbons, cube farm dot-com slave working on fixing the Y2K problem and hating every moment of his miserable work existence. He's got eight bosses (one of whom is played by Gary Cole in a performance so magnificent that you will wonder if he shadowed your boss for a few days to get acting tips--he's that realistic), all of whom jump his case whenever he makes mistakes. He's surrounded by the lady with the annoying voice, co-workers cursing at a broken fax machine, the old timer who sees layoffs around every corner...and Milton, the weird guy we've all seen in our offices, the mumbler, the nervous wreck, the guy we all take bets on when he'll snap and go postal. A visit to a hypnotherapist turns Peter's life around, and he stops caring about his job...just as two efficiency consultants arrive to review company practices and procedures. But instead of getting fired, Peter gets a promotion while his two best friends get fired, and the three of them plot to take their revenge on the nameless, faceless corporation making their lives miserable.Look for Jennifer Aniston in a very nice small role as a waitress at a TGIFriday-esque restaurant who becomes Peter's girlfriend and learns to stand up for herself at her job. Look fast or you'll miss Orlando (7-Up) Jones in a bit part that is so funny and so real that you'll wonder how long he studied those guys who go door-to-door with the magazine subscriptions. But most of all, look at the atmosphere of this film and marvel at how eerily accurate it is. They say you know your job stinks when you think of Dilbert as more autobiographical than funny; your job is really terrible when you can spot your office in OFFICE SPACE. See it soon!

review/text: While Ernst Cassirer provides an illuminating analysis of the nature of myth in The Myth of the State, he never tells his reader what the western myth of the state is. Extrapolating from his analysis of Plato, Augustine, Thomas Aquinas, Machiavelli, Carlyle, the racist Gobineau, Hegel, et al, what emerges is the unfolding of a theory of the state, not a mythos of it. The passionate and emotive elements of myth, which Cassirer brilliantly explicates about myth in general, are never made explicit in his analysis of the theory ("myth") of the state (except at the end when he discusses Nazism). If anything, these elements are subsumed in the content of his analysis.Nevertheless, Cassirer masterfully explains much of the development of the western theory of the state through time. He hits on many of the salient thinkers and philosophical movements. Yet, inexplicably, some important thinkers seem to get short shrift comparatively speaking (e.g. Aristotle) and others scarcely manage more than a brief mention (e.g. Marx). Readers might find (what turned out to be) Cassirer's parting shot at Heidegger and the proto-fascist elements of his philosophy fascinating (Cassirer died in 1945 and The Myth of the State was published posthumously). Perhaps most intriguing is how Cassirer reserves most of his ire for Hegel, arguably making his philosophy most responsible for the intellectual underpinnings of the rise of National Socialism in Germany--an analysis not entirely unpredictable for a neo-Kantian like Cassirer to make given how, in the historical estimation of many, Hegel eclipsed Kant as Germany's preeminent philosopher.Notwithstanding these limitations, The Myth of the State is worth reading. Cassirer's analysis of the development of the western theory of the state is evidently too sagacious to be missed.

If you are looking to get a young person into comics this is an excellent way to start. Jim Starlin is in rare form and paints an excellent picture of angst and despair, and finally joy and astonishment. The book shows you the majestic quality of the Marvel heroes, and their epic struggle to safe guard their world against even the most impossible odds. This book displays the greatest show of courage and strength ever seen in comics. As the reader, you are given a chance to cheer, cry, and stand in total awe of all the visual magnificence dilivered in rare form by both George Perez (The Teen Titans, Avengers) and Ron Lim (X-Men 2099, Mutant X). If you want to see Marvel at its best, The Infinity Gaunlet is the best possible example.

review/text: I'm a very open-minded person and I believe there was a conspiracy behind the JFK assassination. But this book only does more to discredit conspiracy theorists because it is poorly documented and reads like a novel. Probably 80% of the book is verbatim, quoted material from 30 years ago. Page after page of dialogue is quoted when all is needed is a careful summary of each exchange Ms. Hill had with various persons. It is hard to believe Ms. Hill could have remember in detail every conversation she had with every person she met over 30 years ago. I don't believe it. I think great liberty is taken in creating an interesting story but putting aside believability. It would be a good novel -- but this is bad reseach. I am impartial to Ms. Hill's story -- I think she probably saw a third gunman.

review/text: ** Major plot points revealed ahead **Having thoroughly enjoyed _The Mayor of Casterbridge_ and _Jude the Obscure_, both of which featured strong central characters and real pathos, I was somewhat disappointed with _Tess of the D'Urbervilles_. The novel starts promisingly enough: early on, Tess Durbeyfield's family learns that it is descended from the noble and ancient D'Urberville clan. Tess's father is so elated at this news that he drinks himself into a stupor, requiring Tess to perform his delivery route early the next morning. Unused to the work, she gets into an accident, killing the family's only horse, and is sent to a nearby D'Urberville homestead--which the family thinks belongs to a rich relation--to beg a replacement.Alec D'Urberville, the owner of the mansion, is a wealthy bourgeois who purchased the D'Urberville surname. He hires "cousin" Tess as a farmhand and attempts to seduce her. Eventually, she gives in (some reviewers wrote that she was raped; Hardy never spells out the nature of their sexual relationship, but various clues led me to believe it was consensual). Tess becomes disgusted with this way of life and returns to her parents, soon realizing that she's pregnant. The child dies soon after birth, however, and Tess leaves home once again to find employment.She meets and marries Angel Clare, with whom she believes she is mutually madly in love, but to whom she cannot bring herself to reveal her past relationship. Finally she does so, at the worst possible time--their wedding night--and Angel, being one hell of a hypocrite (he had just "confessed" to her that he once spent two days with a hooker) rejects her. Brokenhearted, Tess goes back to work, falling deeper into poverty while mourning the loss of her husband's love. By sheer coincidence, she runs into Alec D'Urberville again, who expresses real remorse when he learns that she had had a child by him and had been disgraced, and offers to marry her and legitimize their relationship. Although Tess dislikes Alec and holds out as long as she can, hoping for Angel to return to her, she finally accepts Alec's offers of assistance and security and elopes with him--right before Angel arrives to reconcile with her. Upon seeing her husband for the first time in years, Tess spurns him, then runs upstairs and stabs Alec to death. At the end of the novel she reconciles with Angel, then is executed for Alec's murder.If the latter half of the plot sounds a little silly, it is. Tess is not a wrongdoer or a "bad woman," but she is utterly spineless, submissive, and slavishly devoted to her husband--himself a weak hypocrite who abandons his now "impure" wife. If you're looking for a Victorian novel with a protofeminist heroine who defies public opinion and really belives women's role in society ought to be improved (as in the works of Burney, Wharton, or even James), you won't find it here. The real tragedy of _Tess_ is that she victimizes and punishes herself as much as the society that condemns her. Oddly, the most sympathetic character in the novel is the villain, Alec, who, having destroyed Tess's virtue, feels genuine remorse and tries, in good faith, to make it up to her. Tess is a creature of such gutlessness--time and time again, she finds herself unable to assertively communicate with those around her even when it's imperative that she do so--that it's impossible to imagine her stabbing this fellow; one of the major faults of this work is the implausibility of the characters' development.As always, Hardy pens lovely descriptions of his famed Wessex as well as of 19th century farm living; as a travelogue, this novel can't be beat. But the story lacks any real conflict: Tess is so despairing and accepting of her fate that we can't hope she'll ever move forward, and she doesn't. The inevitability of _Tess's_ conclusion is its tragedy.

review/text: The foundation is setup to secretly monitor mankind through its darkest hours. It reminded me a little of Orwell's 1984. In placing humans away from the central government on a planet with few resources. They are forced to develop quickly. This is a novel more about political machinations than about action. The contradictions in human nature are here to analyze. The characters use guile, spirit, & cunning to survive. Some 80% of the book is dialogue & the character development is a bit shallow. Nonetheless, Mr. Asimov portrays the future in poignant & diverse ways. The predicted conflict makes the story of galactic history entertaining, especially since this was written in 1951. Some 7 years before Sputnik was launched. The author deserves praise for his imagination that was well ahead of his time.

This book is somewhat different from the others in that it it goes deeply into one characte's thoughts and emotions. One could label the book slow, but I didn't find it that way. I found the story of David Lurie's mother to be by far the most painful to read. As a reader, we are given only bits and pieces of this woman's very broken heart. Perhaps it's a sign of a wonderful writer that every character in this book seemed to warrant a book of his or her own.

Only have one CD at this time and have to keep taking it from house to car, cause it is the only thing I've listened to since I got it. I'd say there'll be at least 5 radio hits, and really the whole CD is wonderful and has a little bit of everything on it. Great ballads, catchy pop tunes, one song with an uptempo kinda country tinge to it ( one of my personal favorites) and a couple of tunes that are reminiscent of some of the Beatles sounds.

While the temple symbolizes everything that is beautiful for the book's tragic protaganist, it also reminds him of his own insignificance. The book is written from a Buddhist perspective and gives a glimpse into the paradoxical world that is Japanese.

review/text: Representing Reality theorizes documentary in all-round perspectives. Among others, I think this book is important especially in that it raises the question of reality per se. Documentary has always been marginal not only in discourse but also in cinema industry, under the poor understanding of reality. I think Nichols's notion of &quot;reflexivity&quot; is a key concept itself in understanding documentary, which also provides a good alternative reading regarding what is documentary or not. I think this book will give you a great deal of food for thought, when you have ever contemplated what is real and when we become to question about what we are seeing, not only in films but also in real life.

review/text: From the time I first watched this movie, about age 5 or so, and up until now I have watched this movie at least once every year. I have never been so affected or inspired by a film. The songs and animation are unique, beautiful and moving. But the story and impression it made on me was very deep and almost spiritual. As &quot;mature&quot; as I am now I still cry my eyes out when I watch it. It is not a movie that many people have seen and so far I have only met two people who saw it at some time in their life and remembered it for all its beauty. I know it may sound crazy, but when I meet those who have seen it I have a greater inclination to get to know them and I think they understand a secret I behold deep in my heart and soul. I dare not say it here...but I long for the day I meet someone who shares this treasured knowledge. Watch this movie for any reason- you may gain something.

review/text: I grew up on these books and the biggest part of their allure and charm was the nightmarish and frightening artwork by Stephen Gammell. I am EXTREMELY disappointed that they are being re-drawn with a washed out and flowered up style. Please take my advice and buy the original, it is definitely worth it, I promise. I think it is sad that some children will never know the original drawings because parents are too uptight and make a big fuss about them. Too sad. They are SUPPOSED to be scary, you know?

review/text: As a response to one of the reviews that speaks quite highly of this novel, I would like to say that despite my understanding and comprehension of the book, I still found it entirely dull, boring, and a waste of my time. Since it was required of me to read this book in school, I was forced to make my way through each dragging chapter, but I would have never on my own time, and it's not because I didn't understand the book that I feel this way about it. My class discussed quite thouroughly about the book's symbolism, which was Golding's intention to start out with. Despite its hidden meanings, the novel still remains absolutely ridiculous in the sense that these young British boys turn completely salvage and kill their fellow islanders. If the book was looked at through a totally symbolic perspective, it would make more sense, but in order to understand its symbolism, one still has to read it, and it is really not worth it.

review/text: Although I didn't purchase this movie through Amazon, I thought I'd enjoy having this Blu-ray combo pack. The movie is fun. Better in my opinion than I would have thought. The action is fast and the CG has come a long way in the short time between the first and third movies.My one complaint is that although, you get a combo pack with the DVD and a digital copy, you get no extra features. If I had known that, I'd have waited to purchase it at later date. I thought it was insulting to include a coupon for the 3D copy of the movie in the package itself.Will I purchase the next version with all the extras? No.Buyers who don't care for any extra features will be happy with this version. The transfer to Blu-ray is very good. Surround sound works great on a home theater system.The story is really only an excuse for the action. Don't think about it because there is very little plot. It's a fun popcorn movie but missing vital information for those interested in any of the background information.

In life I have learned that there are people who you will meet that are not worthy of you knowing on any level. It's nothing personal, but there are just some people who you will meet in life that are just full of it and have no aspirations, goals and/or plans in life. Sista Souljah does speak the truth on many issues such as racism, sexism, being intelligent and at the same time being overlooked in the black community, poverty and education.I would recommend this book to anyone who is willing to question our status as Africans living in America.

Wow, so simple, but unfortunately this is not how our policy makers think.I think that high school students should read this book before they enroll in economic courses that bore them to death with all the graphs and mathematical calculations.

review/text: It's a difficult country to gain respect in, America that is, for foreign musicians...Especially those who don't care to be recognized for their cute gimmicks or for novelty. Cibo Matto, though acclaimed for their debut Viva La Woman!, have masterfully and elegantly avoided being artistically restrained to one idea or concept with the eclectic release Stereotype A. This record is groundbreaking for the band and is, perhaps, an affirmation of the strength of good pop music everywhere. While Viva La Woman was symbiotic in themes and musical textures, Stereotype A is all over the map stylistically and in focus. 'Working for Vacation' is a crazy stomp through electronic breaks and middle eastern melodies, while 'Blue Train' is a heavy metal anthem making you check your decks to see if you're still listening to the same record. 'Sci-Fi Wasabi' will please Cibo fans who are fond of Viva's girlie shout-outs, and 'Spoon's get-down-on-the- get-down funkified bassline will have even the most boring of you bobbing your heads. A great element on this album that was a bit underdeveloped on Viva is the inclusion of several ballads. 'Moonchild' is an amazing tune showcasing Miho's pipes better than even 'Birthday Cake'. My favorite track is definitely the gorgeous 'Sunday part 2'. Lyrically and structurally, it is one of the most beautiful songs I have had the privelege to hear in a long time. Overall, Cibo Matto have established themselves as an important element in pop music and we can surely expect a great deal of amazing material in the future from them.

review/text: Review of the Box Set: 2 starsBut for now, I'm reviewing this box set. I can't speak for everyone, but in the box set that I received, the pages in every last book were frayed and uneven, as though they'd been cut with crayola scissors by someone with a very unsteady hand. If you can, get the books from some other source.I really like these books, so this was a -major- letdown to me.Review of Mere Christianity: 4 starsI had to get to this book eventually. In apologetics circles, it's considered a classic. Strong-worded enough to be assertive, and yet still vague enough that it can be used by both Catholics and protestants alike to defend their faith.I have to say straight-out that I consider most of this book to be a masterpiece, even though I generally balk at anything even the slightest bit vague. I had a few issues with the book from time to time, but none of them is anything major, and I can deal with them quickly in just a few paragraphs, while also covering the stuff I particularly liked.Lewis is as much of, if not more of a popularizer than he is a theologian, so his prose and patterns of speech are nice and casual; usually easy to read, even when dealing with very complex subjects.He first talks about natural law, the difference between right and wrong, and the reason for that difference. No disagreements here. Next, he discusses conceptions of God and our relationship with him. Still no complaints. Lewis is frequently amusing throughout these parts, as well as edifying. Many of his comparisons are obviously intended to be humorous, while still being entirely true and correct.Next, he gets into the meat of morality, and several key sins, such as sins against the virtues, social morality, sexual morality, offenses against marraige and so forth. All good and important topics. The one problem I have here is that he describes sexual immorality as one of the "least bad" sins. It's not. In fact, it can be one of the most dangerous mortal sins, not because of its inherent severity, but because of its inherent draw, and the complexity of the issue, which often makes it hard to comprehend why it's wrong. The problem, of course, is that sexual immorality devalues another person for your own pleasure, and when you start devaluing people for pleasure, it's -very- hard to stop, until eventually, you devalue everyone, and the only person you care about is yourself. Sexual immorality, in other words, can lead to the mentality that other people exist only to give you pleasure or satisfaction, which is as far removed from Christian charity as you can get.Next, the book gets into more of the virtues, as well as the vice of pride. I didn't think Lewis sufficiently pinned down just what exactly the sin of pride -is,- what makes it a sin and when, but I'm always looking for greater specificity in things like this.Book four of Mere Christianity gave me, I think, the most problems. Let me see if I can outline them.1. Lewis seems to think being nice is an inherently good thing. I can think of many situations where this wouldn't be the case, like a drill instructor, or a parish priest during his homilies. I'd have defined the difference between "nice" and "good" a bit more closely first.2. There's something of a division within Christianity on the subject of whether the resurrected saints are completely different people, or whether they're the same people; just resurrected with a better chance to live their lives well. I'm of the latter school of thought. Lewis, it seems, is not. Related to that...3. Lewis seems to imply that we need to sacrifice everything we've ever known, including our personhood, permanently, in order to make room for God. This is a misunderstanding. God is infinite. If we needed to "make room" for him, we could only do it by ceasing to exist. He seems to go back on this somewhat in the final chapter, but there's still the sense that the sacrifices of Christian life are permanent, not temporary, and that's not how I read Romans 8:11. I've always taken that verse to mean that all the things we have to give up in this life; "kill" here on Earth for the sake of doing right, will be restored to the saints in paradise, once the risk of sin is past.Still, as I said, none of these issues is too major, and none really tells too badly against this book. Additionally, there's an analogy near the end of the book which, in my view, is potentially better than even the book's author seems to realize. He describes the Christian faith is a sort of seed of evolution, like lumps on the back of a horse, which will eventually turn into wings, and give it the power to outstrip all the other horses in its ability to leap over barriers. However, until they become functional wings, you won't notice much difference in its ability to leap barriers.Now, the reason I say this is an even better analogy than he may have realized is that really, if a horse had incomplete, wing-like lumps on its back, it would, for the moment, be -less- capable of leaping over barriers, since it would be weighed down by those lumps. We often feel ourselves weighed down by the burden of having to do right; the difficulty of moral values in the face of an enemy who cheats repeatedly, and the realization that we can't achieve victory on these terms. We may even blame our faith for it. However, if we stick it out, if we wait a while, those burdensome lumps will become beautiful wings, and will become, not a hindrance, but an advantage. This, I think, shows some of the potential of this analogy. It's beautiful.If you want a basic grounding in Christianity, you could do a lot worse that to pick this book up and leaf through it. It's got a lot of good answers, which you might just need someday when your kids start asking you big questions about life and the faith.

review/text: Words fail. Inspiration overflows.There is a reason that so many musicians - and non-musicians - hold this album in awe to this day.In my own humble opinion, there simply are no recordings that approach this by anyone I have ever heard. The sheer power of this music overwhelms all who can hear something of what it says. It is from the soul, but not sloppily, not "free", not randomly. It is music by absolute masters at the absolute peak of their powers. They have been assembled by their musical and spiritual leader to give thanks directly to God - whatever form that may take - with nothing between them and that "audience." What they create, what they unleash, are 4 movements of overwhelming candor, of unrivaled expressiveness. The minor blues forms are deceptively simple, hypnotic at times, but these four are masters of the blues, and the Tower of Babel they assemble on that unshakable foundation succeeds in reaching the heavens.It almost trivializes the accomplishment of this recording to praise the stunning technical mastery on display by Coltrane, Tyner, Garrison, and Jones. Rhythms fly on and off the mainline, but remain unfailingly - and at times astonishingly - true to the time. Listen to Elvin's rim shots in the first movement, amid the blurring polyrythmic overlays.This is primal scream, prayer, and devotion by geniuses. It is Picasso's Guernica, Michelangelo's David. It is my first and only nominee for greatest American contribution to world culture.For those who can't hear it, don't blame the album. Try to listen and learn the language. If it continues to make you uncomfortable, then consider the possibility that things that reach your soul hit too close to home.

I think this is better than most other comic book movies [spiderman 1 & 2, league of extraordinary gentleman, Hellboy, Hulk, etc.] Sure its not as devoted to being like the comics as Sin City[which is frame for frame straight out of the comic] but I think it's better that way. Don't get me wrong, Hellblazer was a great comic, but I think the darker version of John Constantine is more entertaining. I geuss I only have two problems with this:1. although this is a good adaptation, I wish they had kept more of the political and religous satire that made the comics so great.2. They never really explained what that guy in Mexico was doing when he found the spear of destiny, that really bugged me.other than that I really enjoyed this, and I think as long as you go in without expecting every line to pulled from one of the comics, you'll probably like it too.

review/text: I have come to appreciate the style of Griffiths over the past few years. I first had his E&amp;M text as an undergraduate and I was grateful for it's simplicity. I now use the Griffiths E&amp;M text to augment my graduate E&amp;M text by Jackson. This is why Griffiths is a good author. He introduces the subject in a clear and concise manner for the purpose of giving the student a solid background.I used Griffith's introductory quantum text when I first came to graduate school. I had not yet taken quantum and so I enrolled in the undergraduate course to give myself sufficient background. Now I am taking a graduate course using Merzbacher's text, which is also a good text, and Griffith's text is the perfect companion.The truth is that no textbook in quantum is completely sufficient for providing a solid background on the subject. The field is relatively new in the realm of physics and I seriously doubt that there are many people on the planet who can say (without their perception clouded by dellusion or arrogance) that they have totally grasped all concepts in the field of quantum physics. One must evolve into a better physicist, and in understanding this very fundamental principle, one can understand that one must start small and eventually progress to bigger things. Griffiths has written a text for those who are taking small or medium sized steps who eventually hope to grasp the concepts introduced in more advanced texts.

review/text: I didn't know it at the time this was assigned to me, but I was bound to hate this book. Correctly called an existentialist masterpiece, the book runs in circles. You cannot identify with this character because he is so detached from his existence. The only 'moral lesson' to be had seems to say that existence has no objective meaning, only that which you give it (an existentialist tenet) and if you give it no meaning, it doesn't matter any way (point of the book).As an Objectivist, I just can't identify with or support that in any way. The book gets 2 stars because Camus' use of language is wonderful, but it is a talent wasted on a pointless book. If you want to read a book with purpose instead, pick up Ayn Rand's Atlas Shrugged. Although her use of language is not as fluid, the themes of her books make much more sense.

review/text: Ok, a lot of reviewers seem to love this film, and I must say I enjoyed watching it too...but only due to the constant jaw-dropping horror and surprise I experienced during this unfathomable exercise in "entertainment."The plot...well, simply it doesn't matter. Suffice to say that Mae West must be well over 80, but she plays a Hollywood sex bomb who has just married for the 6th time. She is greeted by a level of hysteria on arrival in London that rivals the second coming (albeit on a budget). Her new husband is a young Timothy Dalton, long before his James Bond years. The married couple book into a posh London hotel and there are plenty of "laughs" to follow as their planned night of wedded bliss is constantly interrupted by various capers and intruding ex husbands. My reaction to this was..."Thank God for that"! The notion of an 80+ year old woman fighting off the attention of all these 30 something young suitors is plain ridiculous. Its sooo obvious that Mae (game though she is throughout) is simply way too old to make this role believeable. She can barely walk, and her acting consists of little more than creaking around in tight, figure hugging gowns and feathers (mmm...), patting her platinum curls and reading out vulgar double-entendres in answer to any query from a male member of the cast. I don't think she had a single line in the whole film that a) wasn't dirty, and b) contributed something to the plot!If you can suspend your disbelief about this situation long enough to concentrate on the rest of the film, you'll be blown away by the sheer ineptitude of it, not least of all the musical numbers. At one point, all the staff and guests in Mae's London hotel lobby suddenly break into "Hooray For Hollywood" as she checks in...so wrong, and for so many reasons! Then later, Mae and Dalton enjoy a (barely) sung duet of "Love Will Keep Us Together", and there are many more just as bad. Mae has a few brief solo numbers of her own, and its obvious that she didn't have the energy (or the voice) to pull them off, but they are here all the same. Its all so pitiful and there isn't a shred of irony about it. Some reviewers say the film is tongue in cheek, and is not taking itself seriously. I disagree. The film is obviously intended to be a tribute to the curvaceous charms of its star..it's just 40 years too late! But I'm glad, because the amount of laughs you'll get from watching it are doubled for this very reason. There are loads more howlers that I don't have the space to even go into, but nothing matches the bare-faced inappropriateness of the central issue. So do Mae and Tim ever get it together for a night of passion...? If the idea doesn't turn your stomach, get this DVD and find out!

review/text: Like Clarkson's "Thankful," Clay Aiken's "Measure of A Man" meets up to the 'measure' of being recognized as a talented young aritst. As far as meeting up to any other expectations, don't hold your hopes up.He's had the advantage of having millions of teenybopper pop fans watch American Idol, as well as getting tons of publicity over the "Ruben vs. Clay" ordeal that was the talk of the summer. He's had professional music writers write every track on the album, mainly tracks composed of overly cliche themes, nothing of pure originality. He has the talent, but lacks the edge, the edge that will utlimately make of break his career as a musician.Clay is an undistinctive talent - the songs on the album do not step out of the boundries, there is nothing boldly original on his first collection of his released tracks . . . Just an All-American, broadway-talent-type artist, with nothing to more to give. If you enjoy listening to cliche music themed on emotions so many other musicians have analyzed and expressed (and a million times better), by all means, purchase this album.

review/text: This new edition of Sextette presents the film in Widescreen for the first time, with a new transfer from the original print. This corrects the fact that when the previous DVD release was pressed, an inferior print of the film was used, which meant that the VHS version was actually better than the DVD.As a fan of the late, great Mae West I would like to take the time to correct some factual errors repeated on the Amazon page for the original DVD by some of the other reviewers, and add a few comments of my own. Miss West was 84 when she made this film in 1977; she died three years later on November 22, 1980, at the age of 87. She did in fact attend the Hollywood premiere, and received a Lifetime Achievement award from After Dark magazine the same year. The play Sextette was a minor comedy she starred in and wrote in 1961, not the 1920's. When she toured with the stage play she was 68. While it certainly is true that she was but a parody of herself by the time she made the film, many of her fans were grateful for the chance to see her perform one last time, as both her screen and television appearances were far too few in relation to her talent and comedic genius.The cast included many big-league supporting actors and cameos. Timothy Dalton, George Raft, Rona Barrett, Dom De Louise, Tony Curtis, Ringo Starr, George Hamilton, Walter Pidgeon and even Alice Cooper all had scenes with the star, resulting in a film that can only be classified as pure camp. It was a tribute to Miss West's reputation that so many of these stars were anxious to work with her. I once met a lighting technician who was assigned to the original stage tour of Sextette, and he confirmed what I had always heard - Mae West was regarded as a total professional and a consummate artist by all who worked with her, and absolutely loved by the crews on both her movies and plays.Many critics were quick to promote the rumor that she was totally senile at the time of filming, and there were many rumors about how she had to have her lines fed to her through an ear-piece. This rumor is belied by watching her lip-synch her way through any one of several songs on the soundtrack. On "Happy Birthday, 21" for example, her timing is absolutely perfect and her lips move in complete harmony with the recording, not a minor feat for someone her age. On a few of the funnier lines, her delivery is classic West at its best, and she shows flashes of her famous impeccable timing just as often as she shows her extreme age. Yes, she looks, moves and talks like someone in their late 80's, but what can one expect? The fact that she had the stamina and chutzpah at that age to even appear before the cameras was amazing in itself.Strictly for fans? Absolutely, but I for one am glad she bothered. If you want classic Mae West get a hold of I'm No Angel, She Done Him Wrong or Klondike Annie and see her in her prime, but if you are a devoted fan you will want to see this film as well.PS - It's about time that this woman had a major documentary devoted to her talents. Her TV appearances, which are almost completely unavailable, include her 1959 Academy Award duet of BABY IT'S COLD OUTSIDE with Rock Hudson and guest stints on the Dean Martin and Red Skelton variety shows. Her only TV appearance available on DVD is her guest shot on Mr. Ed. The few of her TV guest shots that I've seen (which was before VCR let alone DVD was invented) were great, and I'd pay big bucks to find a DVD documentary or collection that includes them all.

review/text: I needed to replace a previous InSinkErator H990 instant hot water dispenser installed in our kitchen sink. I was not pleased that the prior model had failed in about three years time but decided to replace it with the newer model from InSinkErator. I was impressed with the design change that replaced a formerly plastic heating tank with a much more durable stainless steel tank. Also, I liked being able to keep the old faucet component and still hook up the new tank. The backward compatibility was a nice touch and can save installation time. I also like the new temperature setting large knob which replaced the old metal cover hiding the temperature adjustment.Don't set the temperature too high or there is a lot of spitting and girgling at the end of each heating cycle.The installation had no surprises and I was delighted enough to buy the same unit for my daughter and her husband and installed it over Thanksgiving holiday up in Boise. The unit is ideal for making single cups of tea or getting a head start on boiling water on the stove. The new larger tank 1/2 gallon vs. 1/3 allows more cups to be drawn in a short period of time.

review/text: The starting point and first dot is Orwell's 1984 how language is used to control large populations. The second dot connects Big Brothers tactics to modern politics and business. Hmm, Big Brother could have written the American 2001Patriot act himself. The Last but not lease dot is connecting the 1984 dots to Americas "race" problem.Do you know who and what land area they were fighting over in 1984? Most experts think that Orwell was writing about totalitarian government. He was, but that was not all he was writing about. Big Brother and Oceania were trying to get control of a particular land, and its people, and resources. Where was this land? If you read the book, I bet you do not remember. You read the answer, it was at the end of the book. When you read it, your bio-computer (Brain) had a Brain Crash. Because what Orwell reveals in the end is so well connected to modern times and what is actually happening, today it is too scary to contemplate for most Americans.Yes and today we have the Patriot Act, and Neighbors who become part of the "disappeared".

I couldn't possibly think of another movie with such sheer cinematic buzz, it's cut like an MTV video: blink and you may miss a visual gag.The theme is doozy but interesting -- a slicing of the same reality in time into three perspectives. Blending an innovative mix of animation, still photography, slow motion, and normal cinematography, it illustrates how the smallest change in what a person does can alter the rest of their life, not to mention the lives of others, including complete strangers they pass on the street.Ironic, creative, and simply riveting -- a fabulous kinetic pleasure of a rental. The breathless high-octane soundtrack should be in your dance collections too.

review/text: 'Revelation could make use of the pre-established harmony which it had itself laid at the basis of its scheme.' p 43Geerhardus Vos raised the curtain when he insisted, 'to unfold Paul's eschatology is to set forth his theology as a whole', p 11, specifically in terms of the two ages, namely, this age and the age to come. The essay which defined Vos' eschatology was printed under the title 'The Eschatological Aspect Of The Pauline Conception Of The Spirit' (printed 1912). The seminal thoughts found there Vos later elaborated on to successfully publish his plenary tour de force in 1930, which marked a stage of development in the theology of Pauline literature not yet known, and hitherto not yet equalled.In Scripture the rapture and renewal of the earth is subordinate to the resurrection - not preceding the resurrection, but said to follow on the resurrection. In fact, our Lord and Christ explicitly stated: 'I am the Resurrection and the Life.' The dispensational hermeneutic specifically misinterprets the singularity of the revelation to be revealed in us, as Paul deals with in Romans 8:18-19. At issue is not just the rapture, as is misleadingly proposed by Tim LaHaye, but a much fuller climactic event. The whole of creation is on tip-toe to see the sons of God revealed, as the inanimate creation anticipates its own renewal, following instantly upon the resurrection of all the dead. With remarkable foresight Vos deconstructed the exegetical excesses of the popularLeft Behindalliance. No other Pauline work has so successfully delimited the patently diverted modern interests of resurrection theology.In OT times 'eschatology' was connected to the Hebrew word, aharit; rabbis would usually introduce the teaching of the messianic age with this specific word, which literally translated means 'hindmost' or 'after that'. Says Vos of the NT usage: 'Acts has but one instance of the use of the phrase, 2:17, and this is a quotation by Peter from Joel 3:1, where the Hebrew does not contain it, but simply says 'after that'. But this easy substitution [Gk: 'and it shall come to pass in the last days'] proves that the formula was thoroughly familiar in early Christian circles. Apart from Paul, the other NT references are: Hebrews 1:2; James 5:3; 1 Peter 1:20; 2 Peter 3:3; 1 John 2:18; Jude 18.' p 7NT believers markedly differ from OT Jews in that they distinctly view themselves already to be living in the 'last days', or the epochal 'after that', or in the 'times of the Gentiles'. The Greek word predominantly used for 'last' is the word eschatos, and for the 'times' [Gk: chronos] and 'epochs' [Gk: kairos] (ESV), Christ reserves exclusively to the knowledge of the Father (Acts 1:7). When related to the plan and purposes of God in history, both the Hebrew and Greek terminology strongly imply that the consummation of such a plan is wholly under divine control and inevitably certain, eventuating in the great and Johannine 'last day' of the Lord. How Vos leads us up to the eternal state is, inevitably, an accomplishment identifiable of true genius. You can try and put a gloss on the rapture, but in the end the reality is unavoidable.'The very name 'coming aeon' [Gk: parousia aionos] is not merely expressive of futurity, but also carries within itself the element of direct successiveness.' p 25'The main structure of Jewish Apocalyptic is embodied in our Lord's teaching as well as in Paul's. And further, 1 Thessalonians 4:15 shows that in an important point of his eschatological program Paul was directly dependent on a word from the Lord.' p 281 Thessalonians 4:15'For we say this to you by the word of the Lord, that we who are alive and remain until the coming of the Lord shall NOT precede those who are asleep.'Vos' aim was to show the clear teaching of Scripture through the denial of chiliasm in refusing to admit this section of Scripture does not teach the rapture or a millennium: 'The use of the verb 'precede' is taken as proof that the question was a mere question of precedence. Paul denies the precedence in the particular form in which the Thessalonians imagined it. There will be no later or earlier as regards believers, no discrimination between the living and the dead as to sharing in the provisional Messianic kingdom. All will be brought by God to be with Jesus at His coming.' p 247 Vos then permitted 'the infallible rule of the interpretation of Scripture is Scripture itself' and introduced into the equation the analogous 1 Cor 15:52 to add more weight to the scriptural import of the all-inclusiveness of the resurrection: 'We shall all be changed...at the last trump, for the trumpet shall sound, and the dead shall be raised incorruptible.''It is true that the descent is suspended, only it is not interrupted.' p 136Also most discernible is Vos' interest in the rendering of the eschatological events in too literal a fashion, betraying a misplaced zeal. Says Vos:'It were wrong undoubtedly to reduce all the things mentioned to the rubric of figurative language... On the other hand we should not overlook the equally obvious fact, even with the fullest intent of accuracy, the apostle had to avail himself of a fixed medium of language, which left no room for a margin of over-literalism, and whose interpretation by others, while seemingly in full accord with the words recorded, nevertheless may introduce an ingredient of inadequacy when compared with the actual intent of Paul...missing in reality...his true conception.' p 142This is the correct interpretive method to be applied to the resurrection passages. Sequence must be established according to their co-ordinate, or subordinate place in redemption - and not by manner of an over-literal hermeneutic, giving precedence to certain catchy words, when clearly sensationalism is not called for or indicated by proper exegesis. This is the full Pauline conception of the resurrection, at complete odds with the rapture agenda, which is hereby seen to be negligible in applying faithfully the whole counsel of God found in Scripture, leading those who essentially subscribe to a 'gap theory' directly to faulty teachings like, i.e. 'two comings', 'two elects', and 'two resurrections'. The resurrection-theme Vos held as central to recreation: 'As a fact, and that a fact not lacking doctrinal explanation, it is, next to the cross, the outstanding event of redemptive history.' p 147

review/text: I bought this book because it seemed to be highly regarded by other parents of multiples. However, I have been disappointed in the overall content. While Elizabeth Noble does a fine job of pointing out that carrying and delivering multiples is often risky (which I knew -- that's why I wanted a book!), she inserts a lot of personal bias and commentary into passages that are presumably meant to be factual/informational. Those of us who are not strongly interested in an organic, vegetarian/vegan diet, and those of us who are NOT REMOTELY interested in childbirth without pain meds, might find the tone of the book off-putting.The many cross-references could be valuable resources for the reader, but the references and information do tend to be older. The first edition of the book was published in the early 1980s; subsequent editing has not addressed Ms. Noble's reliance on studies from the 1970s. Without more recent information on twin mortality and complications, it is difficult for the reader to determine what is REALLY worrisome or advisable.My biggest concern about this book is its focus on all the things that could go wrong. It's true that expectant mothers need to be informed, but we also need to be supported and reminded that the vast majority of twin pregnancies result in two perfectly healthy babies. FWIW, *most* resources that I've seen focus on the scary side -- but the fact that they all do it doesn't make it ideal.I plan to buy another, more recent book to get me (and my babies!) through my twin pregnancy.

review/text: I'll admit that I wasn't really sure what to expect from this movie. It sat on the shelf for three years before Lionsgate decided to finally release it -- straight to DVD. I'm somewhat of a fan of crappy slasher horror movies, mostly of the Evil Dead II variety, and I hoped that Simon Says might be able to give me something new to chew on between viewings of the Sam Raimi classic. It does -- sort of.Simon Says contains virtually every cliche of '80s slasher horror movies. In fact, this film is something of a tribute to those over-to-the-top gore fests. This time, a group of five stereotypical college students (the slut, the straight-laced Asian, the jock, the stoner, and the girl the serial killer is obsessed with) go out into the secluded mountains for a summer camp adventure. Of course, we all know that this leads to drinking, drugs, and a ridiculous amount of sex.Once the movie gets past 30 minutes of boring (and pretty much unneeded) exposition, the serial killer, Simon, makes his move. After attacking one of the college students, he takes out another group of nameless campers who have absolutely no connection to the plot. While this scene is utterly random, it is the best one in the film. Simon kills off a collection of people in highly creative, and highly gruesome, ways (pick-axe, anyone?) that'll make you cringe and laugh at the same time. The gore and the blood are done in such a ridiculous style that you have to laugh at the simple fact that it could never happen.One by one Simon kills off the college students until he is left with his "dream girl." Once virtually all of the characters have been killed off, the movie gets a little flat. The writers attempt to throw in a twist at the end, build the intensity, and make the viewers actually care about the campers. Honestly, by this point I just wanted to see more crazy violence; instead it felt like the writers were trying too hard to make the movie into something that it isn't.Crispin Glover, by far, steals the show as Simon. While his Southern accent is hardly believable, his performance is spot-on and laughably bone-chilling. This is honestly the best performance I have ever seen from him. He pulls off the creepy, disturbed serial killer well and makes viewers wish that there was more of him and his crazy killing antics than the attempt at a plot.This movie has both things that have come to define the slasher horror genre: blood and gore... and boobs, but with a surprising lack of the latter. Yet it also has no intensity, no surprises, horribly corny dialogue, and barely a shred of originality (completely committed to the violence).Simon Says is a polarizing movie. Fans of '80s slasher horror movies and of absurd gore-fest movies will think that it's perfect for taking up a Friday night when you have nothing else to do -- just grab some friends who like these kinds of movies, some alcohol, and a bag of popcorn and you're good to go. However, if you are not a fan of slasher movies or are expecting a horror movie that's actually scary, Simon Says will be an hour and a half of pure pain.

review/text: Originally a series of radio broadcasts that were transcribed into book form with the author's help, C. S. Lewis' witty and systematically logical defense of Christianity still endures as a favorite today. Although intellectual works of this caliber can seem intimidating, his conversational style of communication makes the book approachable and thoroughly enjoyable. He not only addresses the common sense of Christianity, but also thoughtfully doesn't neglect the practical need, the heartfelt void, that Christ alone can fill. All in all, this book is an all-around, solid work that consistently covers all the bases of thought and makes for a great read.

It fails as a novel because there is no story to speak of, just a string of scenes to initiate discussion of the issues Lawrence wished to explore. Apologists describe it as picaresque, but there is far more unity to most novels that deserve that descriptor. Nonetheless, there are wonderful scenes that fitfully jar this book to life, Lawrence's admirable command of language, and a brooding homoeroticism aching to burst out. Try this book after you've hit the major works (i.e. Women in Love, etc.).

review/text: I bought Kingsley's 'Reality' in the hope that it would offer insight to a major pre-Socratic philosopher, and maybe even tie his thought into modern phenomenology and human Being.Unfortunately, the tone, style and method of the book make it very difficult to take seriously. Why?For one, the book is in desperate need of editing. A good half of the text could simply be discarded without any material detriment to the content.This is in large part because the text drips with Kingsley's personal whining about the Western intellectual tradition and his wish that it were simply less rigorous than it is. Every other paragraph seems to be a lament that 'we' are intellectually deficient in one way or another, or are naively not open to one or another assertion. Before long, I discovered that I could quickly identify paragraphs of this repetitious lamentation and simply bypass them without losing the thread of his exposition. For someone who claims that, "...there is no time at all to spare" in recovering Parmenides, he is extremely wasteful of both his and the reader's time.Another issue are his sparse "Notes" and complete lack of footnoting. For someone who purports to advance his ideas on linguistic, cultural and archeological evidence, he certainly invests very little time in referring to his sources or evaluating alternative views. Advocates will argue that he provides frequent references to the Parmenides. However, these references to the text offer little to support his wider claims of context and interpretation. That is a great pity because every now and then he gets around to asserting something very interesting. However, it is often difficult to accept his assertions seriously when they remain unverifiable.In a similar vein, Kingsley often makes vast leaps of argument, taking sparse evidence and pushing his conclusions far beyond any reasonably supportable boundaries. In short, he has written a work of fantasy, based on a small rump of real evidence.This, ultimately, is why there are few notes. This, ultimately, is why much of his text is a lament that 'we' in "the West" - by which he really means 'you' - are not open to wide ranging and unfounded assertions.What Kingsley really wants is for his reader to accept his assertions as a revelation. Unfortunately, his own prejudices, style and method undermine reception by an interested but rigorous reader.I would only recommend 'Reality' to someone who wishes to be entertained by a sort of dreamy mysticism, though Kingsley explicitly denies that this is what he offers.The book will not satisfy anyone interested in a serious consideration of its purported subject matter. There are numerous better books on Parmenides and the pre-Socratics, including: Cordero "By Being, It Is"; Popper "The World of Parmenides"; Coxon's "The Fragments of Parmenides"; Detienne "The Masters of Truth in Archaic Greece". For ancient reception, you might even try Plato's dialogue 'Parmenides'.

review/text: I had decided not to review my favorite studio recording of Parsifal because so many others had already said most of what I had to say. But after listening to the 2nd Act on my lunch hour today, I find I need to blow off some happy steam and share a few thoughts.Much for the same reason as Kubelik's "Meistersinger" was supressed to clear the market for Karajan's inferior recording, this Parsifal languished in the vault for more than twenty years. It is a great pity and shame that one conductor can wield that much power, to the detrement of his collegues, and the loss of the opera-loving public.Rafael Kubelik's flawlessly proportioned, profoundly felt reading of this most ephemeral of Wagner's operas equals the best of Knapperstbusch's live Bayreuth performances with all the advantages of a studio recording: the orchestra and choruses are exceptionally detailed and transparent without any loss of weight in the sound, so all inner voices can be clearly heard. This is especially effective in the Flower Maiden scene, where you get a more visceral sense of the numbers of bodies surrounding Parsifal, rather than a generic choral mass. Kubelik's sense of detail in dynamics and color is a real highlight of this set, and The Bavarian Radio Symphony, particularly their winds and brass, plays magnificently. In this recording, more than any other I've heard, they are the equal of the NY, Vienna and Berlin. He also understands that the voices in Wagner are part of the orchestra, or rather that the orchestra is often 'on top.' You will not have an unnatural prominence of the voice at the biggest climaxes, as is so often the case. The voices may very nearly be subsumed at times, but not entirely lost.Kubelik also has a clear vision of the overall architecture of each act. His sense of pace is generally faster that what we usually hear these days; Knapperstbusch could be very brisk when the spirit was on him; Fritz Busch, on Marston's issue of the 1936 Buenos Aires broadcast is even more manic at times. But when he opts for a slower than usual tempo, the effect is enthralling. Listen to Parsifals first description of his past to Gurnemanz ("Ich hab' eine Mutter"): the stately tempo reflects the majesty of the forest and the dramatic tension begins to increase. The same occurs in the 2nd act at "Ich sah' das Kind." Kundry's gentle, deliberate pace builds the tension released in Parsifal's grief. He also makes a point of combining changes of dynamics with shifts of timbre. This is remakably effective throughout the score and requires playing of the highest calibre. The emotional result is obvious at first hearing and never wears thin.Kurt Moll's superb Gurnemanz was recorded within months of his equally fine reading for Karajan. His vocal health is virtually the same, but there are many differences of interpretation and nuance. This is the mark of a great lieder singer, and great Wagner singers are usually great lieder singers, too. Here he makes wider use of pianissimo singing, especially in Act 3 scene 1; he barely whispers some lines, something he could never do in the theater, and the effect is tremendous.I am unapologetically a huge fan of James King's, and this is some of his best recorded work. He is an anomaly among Wagner tenors; a combination of italiante spinto squillo and a touch of gallic restraint. (He studied extensively with Martial Singher, perhaps the finest baritone France produced in the 20th century, and the eloquent Amfortas on that Buenos Aires broadcast, with his father-in-law holding the baton.) He is hardly unemotional, though he can tend toward a strictness with note values. But if you listen closely (with headphones), even his inhalations are in character, a rare and difficult thing. Only Jon Vickers compares in emotional inolvement, seemingly more so for his greater freedom and less brilliant tone. As is often the case, a phrase by phrase comparison of these two singers shows that they make pretty much the same emotional points, but the sheer opulence of King's sound tends to overwhelm the expressive gesture.Yvonne Minton again sings an impassioned and seductive Kundry, as she did on Armin Jordan's soundtrack to the Syberberg film. The edge in her upper range is a little more pronounced here than it was a few years earlier, but it helps put over Kundry's frantic desperation at the end of act two. She copes well with the role's notorious pitfalls and understands the character completely.Amfortas is sung here by Bernd Weikl, in peak voice. He is a very fine Amfortas, vocally luxurious in fact. He holds out the high G in act one for nearly the full measure, although Wagner only wrote an 1/8-note. He doesn't express the same depth of sorrow as Jose van Dam, or the searing torment of Thomas Stewart, but he surely belongs in that upper echelon.Franz Mazura's Klingsor is one of the best on records, too. He has the natural sound perfect for Wagner's villains, but doesn't rely on it alone. In addition to the native snarl he uses the words, particularly the consonants, to express his hatred and disdain of the Grail Knights.Titurel is sung magnificently by Matti Salminen, and this is a bit of a problem. Why did the engineers choose to place him up front and equal to Amfortas and the Knights when Wagner demands that the voice issue from the crypt? The effect of this scene is spoiled. But, as Jascha Heifetz said, "Only God is perfect."All of the small knight and squire parts are filled nicely. Lucia Popp again lends her ravishing soprano to the 1st Flower Maiden, and the rest of that ensemble is as good as you will hear. The Toelzer Knabenchor and Bavarian State Opera Chorus are magnificent in the Grail Temple scenes, which glow with spiritual intensity. The bells of Monsalvat, however, seem rather thin: more like cymbal and gong tacked together.The original early digital recording has been remastered to the latest 24bit/96kHz technology, and the sound isbrilliant and balanced throughout. My only misgiving (beside the perspective on Titurel) is a hint of room echo, but this is rarely noticable except with headphones.It isn't a problem at all in the interior scenes of the temple, where the Herkulessaal of the Munich Residenz has just enough echo to suggest the domed space of the Grail temple. But forest, garden and meadow sound a bit boxed in.Overall, this is the most satisfying studio performance of Parsifal I have heard. This, and the '64 Bayreuth Kna with Jon Vickersas a live counterpart.

It also briefly explored the conspiracy theory's surrounding Patton's accident. Unfortunately the movie concentrates on George S. Patton Jr.'s time as military governor, thinly veiled attempts to militarily rehabilitate German POWs incarcerated in Bavaria, and blatant animosity toward the Soviets. Additionally, the film spends an awful lot of time on a paralyzed Patton, complete with flashbacks, imobilized in his hospital bed.It was great to see George C. Scott reprise his role as Patton. The problem was that it was easier for a late 1960s Scott to be made up to appear as an older general in PATTON than it was to tackle the problem of an older and more stout Scott as Patton in the 1986 television movie. Scott was just too plump for the role and those overly puffy white eyebrows were more appropriate for Santa Claus than Patton.Remember too that this was a television movie filmed in Great Britain. As such, the budget and associated production was not that of the original motion picture. The US military vehicles are obviously from museums and private collector collections as the gray-green paint is absolutely perfect. Likewise the GIs appear to be wearing less authentic looking period uniforms. Additionally, where the original PATTON was filmed in a variety of Spanish locations including beaches, desert, and thick forest, LAST DAYS is mired in limited British locations. In one scene the painted matte background of the Bavarian Alps is phony and distracting.Although I cannot imagine anyone other than George C. Scott playing the part of Patton, he was not physically ready to take on the role. Remember that the previous year Scott also portrayed a very chubby Benito Mussolini in MUSSOLINI: THE UNTOLD STORY. Other former 'Pattons', such as George Kennedy, Kirk Douglas, and Darren McGavin never fit the role. This movie probably should never have been made in the first place, or limited as a narrarated docu-drama.THE LAST DAYS OF PATTON is as far removed from the original wide-screen movie as THE DIRTY DOZEN: (THE) NEXT MISSION is from the first THE DIRTY DOZEN film.Worse for the film is that its sale and distribution, much like older movies that entered the public domain, have fallen to several different media companies. As such you can find this movie with different covers, sometimes matched with other movies, and differing quality. My advice is for you to buy a copy of the book and avoid the disappointing movie.

review/text: If a textbook for Hindi must use some romanistion then it should use the same system as R.S.McGregors' Oxford Hindi-English Dictionary, as &quot;Teach Yourself Hindi&quot; does. The authors of that title, R.Snell &amp; S.Weightman, teach Hindi at London University's School of Oriental and African Studies.Further this textbook relegates the devanagari script to the rear of the book and includes no devanagari at all for the tape dialogues.As a final black mark the standard reached in the course is way short of Snell/Weightmann. This is partly a product of having 10 lessons instead of 18.Recommendation : Get Snell &amp; Weightmann, and then McGregor's Dictionary and Grammar. Use Bhatia if you need extra tape practice.

review/text: Are you in the mood for a movie as slow as molasses? Do you have a hankering for a mumbling, stumbling, celluloid hero that wanders around the house and gets lost in the woods? Then this film is for you.The only review that will do justice to this movie is a mumbling incoherent one, just like the flick. A little Q&A;:Q So how'd you like the movie?A Mmmf Pongloramin.Q What did you think of Blake/Cobain?A Alch Himlimsh.Q Thank you very much.A Yelcum Bermush.I think Van Sant and crew must've filmed this as a practical joke. He must've thought, "Gee, I have one more movie left in my contract. I think I'll just wing it. No script, no dialogue, let's just hang out at a swank college in upstate New York and soak up some indie/underground rock." Maybe they did it at Bard College. Bard/Blake -- get it?I will say that the music video is a lot better than the movie. It's a hilarious parody of Nirvana that's funnier than Weird Al Yanchovic -- but then again, Al isn't that funny. That video is more of a tribute to Kurt than this sorrowful excess of cinematic depression.If Van Sant had intended to punish his audience by ensconsing them within the mind of Kurt so they can experience his psychotic depression, he should've kept that deleted drum scene and expanded the dolly shot zooming in on his "performance" in the dark, dank room of the house.In the meantime, it'll have to do as a picture for hangover recovery.

review/text: The story we all know: for some unexplained reason the dead are waking and preying on the living. One reason offered is that there is no room left in Hell. Other reasons are viruses or some kind of sickness. Regardless of the reason, this version updates what was a terrific-for-its-time cult classic and indeed makes it better.If you are a preservationist and don't appreciate your classics being tampered with, then just stay away. But if you like a good horror flick that is suspenseful, scary and very very well acted, then add this to your collection. It's just modernized, and in my opinion, made a bit more realistic. The story follows the original version almost line by line (so I can't figure out what all the fuss by the preservationists is about).The "Night" that "it" all started we find several random folks caught in the middle of the chaos looking for refuge in a remote countryside farmhouse. Terror ensues. The confused group battles over how to get out of the situation before the zombies get in. I was especially fond of how ultimately the infamous Barbara (you know..."they're coming to get you, Barbara") introduces Mr. Cooper to fate in this version.As I said, scary, suspenseful and well acted.

It combines the author's own life-long search for the deeper meaning of the Bible with the discoveries of Rudolf Steiner (1861-1925), the founder of Anthroposophy (The Wisdom of Man). The book unveils what people have had to believe only through faith. In a series of penetrating essays the author explains such mysteries and seeming contradictions as the accounts of the Nativity, the nature of the second coming, and the meaning of the Burning Bush.

review/text: This book does not present much information about Chopin the man, and stumbles around endlessly about Chopin's music. The prose is laughably dated. Who can not help laughing at sentences like &quot;Chopin distrusted Jews, but that's the way Poles are.&quot; The French, English, Germans, and Hungarians: Huneker comes up with some interesting stereotypes for them too. Many of the facts are incorrect, as the editor supplies the corrected facts in the footnotes on nearly every page of the text. And the music discussions have the spirit of &quot;What a powerful melody! However, I believe the third note of the 14th measure of Etude 12 op. 10 should be an F sharp, though it's written differently in some scores.&quot; What a snore. I suggest looking elsewhere for real information about Chopin and his music. This book offers no insights though some occasional unintended laughs.

review/text: I can't vouch for the quality of the actual DVD, because I received a blank disc. (I sent it back for a refund.) However, based on the packaging - or lack of it - I would be inclined to agree with David A. Medzorian's assessment that this is an unauthorized bootleg. There was no cover insert - just a clear plastic jewel box in which the disc was placed - and the label looked like a "print-at-home" job. If this is a "print-on-demand" DVD, that wasn't disclosed in the product description. For $19.95, I expected a professional package, and (blank DVD notwithstanding) I didn't get one.If the packaging is this skimpy, it's reasonable for me to believe Mr. Medzorian's comments on the picture quality are accurate. This is not worth your time - or your money.

review/text: I recieved this printer for Christmas and I have to tell you this is the best printer I have ever used!It took me longer to take it out of the box than it took to set it up. No joke. I find it to print slow but that is not a big deal with me. The print quality is amzing. I have to admit I was extremely skeptical when people told me that the picture quality was as good as pictures from a normal camera.Printers take up lot of think though. I must say the ink is not cheap. I don't print pictures that often becuase of the ink price. But honestly you could not tell the difference between something printed on this printer and a normal photo. The only possible upgrade I could think for this printer is borderless prints. It looks very cool too but it's a bit bulky. It is like a computer. It actually asks you questions while you print stuff. Don't pay 300.00 bucks for it. Buy it off Ebay.com. That is where my family got it. We payed 130.00 dollars for it and that it with shipping. Great deal. It was not refurbished either. It was brand new. Even came with a printer cable too. They have plenty left on there so go get one. One of the best computer purchases of my life. Setup was extremely easy! You can plug it in via printer cable or usb! It comes with the usb cord. I am using it via usb. When I plugged it in Windows XP automatically detected it asnd installed it. No software or anything! Guys buy it!You won't regret it!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

review/text: So, here is the deal. I have played and beat every Tomb Raider game out there except for the Game Boy Advance one. Anywho, I ordered this game in September of last year, and delay after delay made me mad. So I cancelled my order and waited until the game was OFFICALLY released for PC(since i dont have a PS2). There are quite a few new things that I like about the game:>Lara looks awsome. New clothes and makeup, with a whole new personality that you actually get to control when she talkes with people.>The new moves are pretty sweet too. Stealth sucked for me at first b/c i just like to get out my guns and take em out. In the beginning, you dont even have ammo for your weapon(no unlimited signature pistols). But you get to use stealth a lot so you'll get good with it.>I also like that you get a nice peaceful break where you can collect yourself and gain some money and valuable information, after your initial run from the police in Paris.There are however some drawbacks which i'll disucss now.>There has always been more glitches with the computer version of a game like this. Lara steps up stairs now and is super sensitive to the steps. Example: If you walk up the step and press left or right, she does a full 90 degree turn in that direction. So be carefull or you'll get frustrated very quickly. Or maybe that is just me.>There are some points that the game just completely glitches and you have to turn it off and restart your computer. So sufficiet to say "SAVE A LOT!" If Lara herself starts to look funny and glitch up, turn it off. It will only cuase you problems later on.>The controls are a little different, and still just as frustrating as ever.All in all though I think that the game was worth the wait...for the most part. I'm looking foward to being able the play the Kurtis character 3/4 into the game. Until then though I recommend the game so far. Just so you know, I'm half way thru the game, and I bought the strategy guide, which is well worth the 15 bucks.

review/text: I will admit that I read this for an advanced high school English class last year, making me one of those notorious 'immature high school reviewers.' However, I'm an English major, and I try to give each book an equal chance and see how they fared in the end. Well, here is Tess:I'm a reader who minds terribly when realism is outweighed by drama and romance. It sounds terrible, I know, but I prefer realism, and become frustrated when there's too much drama and love in a book. 'Too much' is a matter of opinion, of course, but in my opinion, Tess contains too much. It begins to sound overly-Victorian. One bad, dramatic thing after another takes place, and each occurrence seems forced, as though Hardy pushed it onto the paper to further the development of another bad thing. You could say that this is called *plotting*, but it comes across to me as bad plotting.Remember, this is coming from a person who prefers Edith Wharton and John Dos Passos as their recreational reading. Drama and fiction are all okay in my book, but too much of anything is bad. Hardy needs more moderation, in my opinion. So to finish fairly, I'll say that Tess of the D'Urbervilles makes a great dramatic Victorian novel with a beautiful tragic message. However, readers like myself, who are frustrated by large amounts of romance,tragedy,and beauty, will agree that two stars is a perfect rating.

review/text: Run Lola Run is a supercharged, ultra-kinetic roller-coaster ride that twists, turns, and boggles the mind with its remarkable profoundness! Lola is a shocking redheaded punk with a memorable scream, and the film all starts out with a really frantic phone call from Lola's boyfriend, Manni. He needs to deliver 100,000 German marks to his mobster boss Ronni in 20 minutes, or he will die a most definite death. From then on, Lola literally races time in three separate scenarios to save Manni's life, so the movie basically ends three times. Although this movie looks all rock-video, MTV-style from the outside, it actually has a profound message behind its unusual exterior. Plus it's got one of the most heart-racing soundtracks I've heard in a long time. This is probably my favorite movie--next to The Matrix, of course!Rated R, but it doesn't deserve to be. It has a few profanities, some violence, and a couple non-explicit discussions about sex. But that's it. This movie will appeal most to people between the ages of 12 and 25. It also often looks or sounds too weird for people to be interested in it, or they just scoff at the fact that it's in German with English subtitles. But you have to look beyond that in order to appreciate this movie. If you rated it less than 5 stars, you only looked at the outside, and in the third scenario, you were just too dizzified or disappointed to really see what finally happened. But you can still believe whatever you want.

review/text: This book has two major problems.One, its title is misleading. You think you are getting a quick, shortened version of an economics class, but what you are really getting is a conservative, free market view of the economy. If the title had been, Reasons Why The Free Market Is Better For The Economy, I would have a lot less problem with this book. Balanced, Hazlitt is not, and he takes a lot of potshots at Keynes with only the occasional quick nod to the problems the free market can run into. It's not that I disagree with a lot of his arguments, it's that you don't get both sides.Two, it's out of date. It was written in the 1940's. Oh, it's been updated alright. In the 1970's. A lot of economic events have occurred since the 1970's and the conservative view has some explaining to do.If you really want a balanced view of the economy you can check out &lt;50 Economic Ideas You Really Need to Know>. It's balanced, although a bit scatter shot. For a pretty balanced book, but with a left lean, try &lt;Economics Explained> by Heilbroner and Thurow, it tells a more cohesive story than 50 Ideas.

Hmmm, kind of like Pope John Paul II was not a good ally of President Reagan ? John Paul II and his support of Solidarirty was not at all helpful ?

This book is everything that has been written here.The book is highly readable. The book is as up to date as possible. It goes to the election of Ariel Sharon. The book has so much information it can be exhaustive at times. And yes, the book at times seems very sympathetic to the Palestinians and the Arabs. There are many examples of the author leaning a bit in that direction. HOwever, the author does make it clear in many places as well that the Palestinians and many of the Arab nations and extremists other than Egypt and Jordan have been against the peace proccess and are very anti-event the very existance of Israel.so is the book pro-palestinian? at times yes, but i think it is part of a bigger picture and goal of showing all sides and angles of the situation.The bottom line about this book or any history book is whether or not you learn new things by reading it. This book is not perfect. I do not agree with everything in this book, but this book taught be a lot about the situation, this book made me think, and this book exposed me to some point of views and historical facts i was not aware of.Ultimately, this book taught me a lot about what is going on in the Middle East and that fact alone made it a good read.

review/text: In a small California town, life was simple for a teenage punk (Kevin Dillon) who falls for a lovely cheerleader (Shawnee Smith) but one night there's a strange meteorite crashes outside of town with a weird pink goo that consumes an old man's hand. Taken to a doctor, the weird slimy stuff is really alive for it's a monstrous organism that devours any creature or person that stands in it's way, can it be stopped?Quite an awesome remake of the 50's sci-fi/horror classic with Steve Mcqueen that is just as good but with a new explanation on the creature's origin as it's a government experiment from space gone wrong. The acting is very good and so are the nifty special effects and gory detailed scenes of people being engulfed by the slime especially the memorable man being sucked down the sink scene, the blob itself is more nastier and meaner looking then the original glob of strawberry jam.This DVD has good picture and sound quality with the only extras being trailers especially to the movie, but if you love sci-fi horror and the original then get this movie, you won't be disappointed.Also recommended: "The Thing" ( 1982), "The Blob ( 1958)", "Species", "The Deadly Spawn (a.k.a.

review/text: Though IMDb.com raised the sort of factual issues that Hepburn fans would have been expected to have known about, the tenor of this biopic is generally warm. The daughter of a baroness, Hepburn's family is reduced to refugee status by the end of WWII, her father missing and presumed dead. Though living below their station, the Hepburn's are generally sunny about their existence. Audrey makes friends easily, but is a failure as a ballerina. She can't sing or dance, and when she gets her first major gig as Gigi, she can't even act. By then, the script settles on Hepburn's charm as her greatest asset. Never having seen Hepburn act, Collette is nevertheless sold on her stage presence. Actors and directors fawn over her, none knowing of her insecurities or a desire for a future involving a stable family life. Though her star rises further, Hepburn struggles to find that sense of security - eluding her in various misfired or purposelessly sabotaged romances (including one with James Hansen, heir to a fortune and founder of Hansen PLC; also William Holden from "Sabrina"). She turns typically to her mother, who happily enough is a supportive parent - aren't parents normally saddled with the blame in these biopics? Famous names and faces cross Audrey's path, but the story makes her the center of attention everywhere - it seems that there's nobody who can resist her charm. The story climaxes with the "Hollywood Ending" final scene of "Breakfast at Tiffany's", hinting to us that Hepburn finally found her emotional center. (The story doesn't go as far as having an older Hepburn star as the elderly Maid Marian, mourning with Sean Connery over their lost love; nor must we endure Love Hewitt grappling in the dark with Alan Arkin from "Wait until dark".)Love Hewitt manages to sound a lot like Hepburn, but her likeness seems as plagued as those of the other celebrity stand-ins. The makers of this biopic seem painfully aware of how delicate the likenesses are, and they do little to shake up their characters for fear of threatening the resemblance too much. Hewitt's mannerisms seem unconsciously jerky - unlike Hepburn's grace. It's not quite a cutting bio; though perhaps Hepburn doesn't deserve that treatment, a better tribute may just be to kick back with one of her movies. My favorite? "Scharade".

review/text: Like many of the old-time singing cowboys, screen star Gene Autry has long been discounted by some country snobs, who see him as too hokey to be part of the classic country canon. Too bad for those folks, though, because Autry's music is both rich in country tradition and musical show-biz savvy. Like Roy Rogers and other hayseed Hollywood harmonizers, Autry dipped liberally into jazz and swing, giving his music a nice little bounce. The songs are delightfully corny and often well-crafted, drawing on the traditions of the Tin Pan Alley composers -- this is music that was made to entertain, and it still works its magic, all these decades later. This is a nice 2-CD set that gathers material from many of the labels Autry recorded for, including Columbia, Okeh, Vocalion and a slew of smaller outfits, and spans his career from 1931, when he was still singing roughneck blues (ala Jimmie Rodgers) up through the early 1950s, when his success with "Rudolph The Red Nosed Reindeer" had led him to a profitable sideline singing songs for kiddies. This is an excellent collection which really does justice to the wide range of material Autry covered... Highly recommended!

But then, when you wash them, they will shrink into TINY kids looking clothes. I washed these in cold water, did not put in dryer, yet they shrunk about 4 to 5 sizes. I also washed in a gentle cycle, yet the seams look they are starting to fall apart and lint sticks all over them & they come out of the machine FULL OF WRINKLES..so basically after the first wash they are garbage...so unless you plan on having your PJ's dry cleaned, I wouldn't waste my money on these, they were cozy & comfortable at first (although when they arrive they will be WAY TO BIG) but once they make contact with water they are ruined (even though it says they can be machine washed & dried) I can't imagine if I had put them in the dryer, they would probably turn into doll clothes, save your money & buy the cheaper satin version, at leat they don't get ruined in the wash.

He extended that experience when he joined Admiral Richard Byrd for exploration of the Antarctic and became the first man to pilot a plane over the South Pole. During World War Two, Balchen joined the US Air Force as a Colonel and flew hazardous missions to help the Norwegian Resistance fight the Nazis. He and a handful of pilots also flew planes between Stockholm, a neutral hotbed of allied and axis spies, and Scotland. They carried a mixed group of spies, secret types, Norwegian resistance fighters, and one night they carried me. I was interned by the Swedish Government when my bomber crash-landed in Sweden. When I was released, a Balchen plane carried me out while it dodged German night-fighter planes over Norway. Balchen's motto was, "Vee do it," and he certainly did. The book is a fascinating story by a courageous man.

review/text: It's great to see this in print again, but I was aghast when I opened it to find the original Stephen Gammel illustrations missing. Most of my friends read these books as children, and we all remembered the delightfully creepy illustrations long after we had forgotten the stories themselves. Gammel's artwork often broke the fourth wall and put the reader right into the story, so that YOU were walking down a lonely road beside a shadowing figure, and the skeletal haunt was coming straight at YOU. Brett Helquist is an excellent artist, and his drawings are nice, but they are simply ordinary illustrations. This new edition of Scary Stories is just that, ordinary. Scary Stories to Tell in the Dark is no longer an iconic book that will always, always be checked out of the school library and remembered for decades by every young reader. It will no longer lead to a lifelong appreciation for certain genres of artwork. It's just a regular book of ghost stories that can easily forgotten as soon as the last page is turned.

review/text: The three previous reviews are right on: to my mind (and I confess that I am not unique in this) Ulysses is the greatest novel in world literature. It is unrivalled in style (who could rival it?) or in character. And who is not moved by the pathos and humor of the book, the sorrows and triumphs of L Boom? This lovely edition befits the novel itself. You may want to read and re-read and take notes in "corrected" editions. This is the one to stare at lovingly, longingly.

review/text: I think that this is probally the best CD I have ever heard. I dont care what the other critics say, Clay has AMAZING talent and I'm glad that he is doing SO well. I think that my favorite song on the album is &quot;MEASURE OF A MAN&quot;. I liked this song because he sings it like he actually means what he is saying(and I'm sure he does). I also like it because it is just so different from the rest of the songs on the CD and that makes it really unique and fun to listen to. I think that my least favorite song on the CD is &quot;WHEN YOU SAY YOU LOVE ME&quot;. Clay seems to me like a slow song or somewhat up-tempo kinda guy, he doesn't seem like a somewhat fast song kinda guy and &quot;WHEN YOU SAY YOU LOVE ME&quot; is a somewhat fast song. It really is a great song, but it's NOT Clay. Overall the CD was GREAT and I would reccomend it to everyone. There is something in the CD for EVERYONE!!! I'd give it 7 stars out of 5, if I could!!!!!

review/text: When I got this album I was a fairly cocky &quot;guitar nerd&quot; type who loved imitating the likes of Joe Satriani and Steve Vai. A friend told me that John Coltrane had been an influence on Jimi Hendrix, who had of course been a big influence on my heroes. Well, I have to say this music did it for me in a big way. It helped me to see that technique did not necessarily have to lead to aimless flaunting and big, bad hairdo's (the all too obvious problem with most instrumental rock). Still, the beauty of the album took a while to grow on me. I was cocky enough to mistake &quot;out&quot; notes for bad notes. I simply thought the guy didn't know his scales. Still, I liked it. It had soul and it wasn't afraid to take itself seriously. In fact A Love Supreme would easily top any poll regarding &quot;serious soulfulness&quot; in a jazz recording. The lesson, I guess, is that great music is not created to be deconstructed, but rather to be enjoyed. Let this album wash through you (not over) and you'll feel some very nice effects.

review/text: Just wanted to make at least one correction to Mr. Wallace's review posted here. He says that Vice President Cheney's wife, "Liz," wrote a book about lesbian love. Mr. Cheney's wife is named Lynn, not Liz. Aside from the ad hominen attack on our V.P., I wonder how many other errors might be found in Mr. Wallace's ponderous review, if I had time & energy to check?I haven't read the book, so I can't really rate it on content. However, if you can judge a person by the company they keep, then I can see that this book contains too much common sense, objective reality, and documented evidence for a liberal reader to stomach.

review/text: I've been a Neil Young fan for over 10 years. He's been an important part of my life. I was first awstruck by the song "After the Gold Rush." I wondered, when I first heard it, whose chilling falsetto voice is that with such amazing lyrics? I was driving when I heard the song and was just blown away..I can only compare his voice to that of the singer of Five for Fighting. I find it beautiful and unique. Like Neil, himself.Prairie Wind starts with a mellow and catchy tune and then enters into a scene from Hawks and Doves with No Wonder. Very similar start off to "Captain Kennedy."Tracks 3, 4 and 5 really hit the road running. "Falling off the Face of the Earth" is a very pretty song. I especially love Neil's voice on this one and how he manages to even take it an octave higher. Very effective and melodic.What really stirred me up was the next song, "Far from Home." It's a blues/folksy song with horns intermixed (like from his album "This Notes for You." You'll find yourself slapping your knee or stomping your foot on this one. The song itself is a reflection on family values, memories of growing up, his father and his longing for the stark tranquility of the prairie, which I can strongly relate to..Next, is my favorite song, "It's a Dream." This is a masterpiece through and through. The way Neil conjours up images of the past and explains them is amazing. The song brings visions of a simpler and better time. A boy fishing under a bridge, the blueness of the sky, the winds of autumn, an old man taking time to talk to a policeman when policeman had time to chat, the imagery of a train station and its passengers departing into the prairie. For Neil, these were days passed by that he is longing for again. A more innocent time. This song brought tears to my eyes for so many reasons. Almost like "A Man Needs a Maid" does for me when I hear the lyrics "..when will I see you again?.."Here there is a more classical music sound mixed with the tune.Of course, you'll never hear it on mainstream radio due to being too lengthly and actually having substance. Truly a great song that makes you think of your own good memories. Neil really gets in your head with this song.It truly, to me, is one of Neil Young's most amazing songs ever made."Prairie Wind", "Here For You" and "This Old Guitar" all are very good songs, as well. "This Old Guitar" seems to come from Harvest Moon and is very nice. "Prairie Wind" is catchy with repeated chorus verses by backup singers (I think Pegi, his wife, and Emmylou Harris)"He Was The King" is a tribute to Elvis and "When God Made Me" is almost a gospel song. I could easily see churches using these lyrics for their choirs to sing. It's a nice song asking questions of belief, existence and why we're all here. I heard Neil play this live and liked it.All in all, this album fuses sounds from Harvest, Harvest Moon, On The Beach, This Notes for You, Silver and Gold and Greendale in a very smart way. Neil is always changing and inventing himself. This is why I love his music and presence so much.I can't wait to see what's next.Great effort by the master!

review/text: I am an intermediate runner I would say. I run various 5K and 10K's, Half marathons and have started to dabble into the world of trail and adventure racing. I say that to let you know I am no professional but I do love to run and compete against myself. For the Kansas City half marathon this past year I wanted to try a minimalist shoe to see if my times would change any from my times I produced in Nike Vomero's and Mizuno Wave's. I tried multiple pairs of this type of shoe on and unfortunately for me (due to the color scheme) these felt the best.I was amazed at how comfortable they felt because by looking at them you would think it would feel like an old High School CC waffle, not the case. The only running I did on these prior to raceday was about 5 miles at an easy pace on a treadmill to get the feel of the shoe. Raceday comes and yes I get alot of looks but I eventually get over that. The first couple of miles were interesting and I thought I had made a mistake. However, once I got into my stride these performed greatly. I was able to maintain splits at personal record times with no thoughts about foot and leg pain. By the end of the race I had knocked off 5 minutes from my previous times, I will let you decide whether it was the shoe or training. My legs felt great as did my feet. I did have one little "hot spot" on one of my toes but that should be expected.I tried these just to see what it would be like to race in a minimalist shoe and I can now say I will never race in a trainer again. I swear by these shoes for racing and speedwork. Get over the color scheme and enjoy this pair of shoes. Oh yeah the "ecco friendly" piece doesn't hurt either.

review/text: 'A Simple Wish' is a cute, fun family film. It's about a young girl named Annabel (Mara Wilson) who wishes for a fairy godmother. Her brother thinks there are no such things as fairygodmothers. Well, Annabel's wish comes half true. Instead of getting a fairygodmother, she gets a fairygodfather, instead! Anyway, soon they meet an evil fairygodmother who they try to destroy. It's very fun and really cute. I saw it on TV and it was very good. All the actors in this film give great performances, and the script is pretty good, too. I definitely recommend this film for families everywhere!

review/text: I bought this film on a whim, since the store I went to didn't have 'exactly' what I wanted (OUATIC 2 fer sure)SO I figured I'd watch the last in the series since OUATIC and America was a HUGE disappointment for me. I have yet to make up my mind on Jet Li films. And this put me in the negative state (again) The story was slow and unmoving, the characters were not interesting, the fighting was sparse (why else get a kung fu film?)and the last fight with Jet in a chicken suit (JET LI IN A CHICKEN SUIT!!!!!)was the last straw. I'm sorry, but if Fist Of Legend was his best, then this must have been by far his worst. &quot;I wouldn't buy this DVD with YOUR money!!!&quot;

review/text: I grew up in the church and believed what the Bible says but at times had doubts and was unsure as to what real christianity was. I was annoyed and discouraged by what I had seen as 'play Christianity'. At a point when I was tired of 'religiousness' I read this book.It is awe-inspiring. It causes one to focus on the Christ in Christianity and presses the point that the focus should not be on one's goodness or the social values of the world, after one reasonably looks and considers the case for Christianity they will realize that it is true and real and that Christ might be trusted and that the sphere of religion isn't where my focus should be but that of Christ.A must read! Add to your collection!

review/text: This film is artistic, more so than most other Van Sant films. By artistic I mean that if you don't have a great appreciation for film or Kurt Cobain, you probably won't understand why most reviews are sooo good.I basically wanted to say that this film reminds me of many Nirvana songs (mostly Something In The Way) because despite the pure simplicity, it impacts you in ways you've never been impacted before. The slow, repetitive nature of Blake compares to that of Kurt's songs. I think that Van Sant had this in mind while making the film because he uses film techniques that lead the viewer to their imagination which, in the case of this film, leads to pity and admiration.I love the film, but if you saw Elephant or Gerry (Van Sant's two films most resembing this one) and didn't quite like either and you aren't a big fan of Kurt Cobain, you should still see it!

review/text: MANSON IN HIS OWN WORDS - BEWARE , 'DREAMS YE CONQUER CARE!'Hello there fans of amazon.com Manson litterature - just to let everyone know , Manson in His Own Word isn't by Manson himself.Ask yourself; why should a man who has got all the time in the whole wide world to leave his body and go anywhere he wants , go spend some time write a book he didn't even announce , seemingly on any interview that he was gonna write?Let's never underestimate the fact that Charles Manson is Charles Manson , and that like the wolf , scorpion and black panther , Charles Manson is so unpredicteable that I sound like a dammer when I say to all the five and four star viewers here that this book wasn't written by him. I trusted my source and made a decision in advance since , that from then on I'd write a critical review on Manson In His Own Words that'd expose the myth that the book had in fact been written or compiled by Charles Manson , number two , that it was a good book , and number three , that Manson would be likely to spend vast amounts of time to pin down some words in some script instead of doing the soul of the world thing - which is his music.After having seen the white and red covered , now internationally acclaimed Manson movie , I feel I have somewhat more of an understanding of Manson's mind than many others. As a teenager I felt I understood Manson to the point that I drew a picture of myself , bald headed with a nazi swastika between my eyes to emphasize the concept of what we felt then to be holy or sheer terror. I was obsessed with exorcicing any fear inside of myself at that time - that is during my teenagehood years , and I was thus seriously sinister as a teenager and I enjoyed that reputation. But just because I may feel so on what I feel to be my understanding of how Charles Manson's mind works or operates , that's just me - no need to take seriously any content in a statement I make on such an issue , because everyone is free to have their own opinions - the people of the world are entitled to free speech.Manson could utter all he needed to utter and why should he have had any need to put that down on a few pages? A book compiled by Manson would in my view be a gigantic volume filled with all kinds of psychedelic imagery which not even the author of this book would be finding himself or herself in a position to comprehend fully.On atwa.be. Charles Manson said that God is air - and that without air , we cannot be. So this gives in my view a whole different meaning the concept of our ideas and beliefs being sort of air - without them , we can't forge the years ahead in our societies. No matter how many or few Charlie may have killed or how he may have behaved , no matter how sane or less than sane he may appear , because we're all one and we're all manifestations of the Infinite , the more we lie to ourselves and cheat on ourselves and beat our little ones before we put them to bed , the harder we are on ourselves and the less we are really saying , and everything we are saying becomes a kind of chit chat - thus , we're lying to Charlie.That is , we are lying to him when we're lying to ourselves , and encouraging ourselves to be more violent than is necessary by being more violent than is necessary. Once peoples'seemingly ceaseless desire to lie to themselves so much ceases to be , it becomes easier to rise above that need and move on. In Charlie's world , Charlie can be a racist one moment and a humanist the other - but that's his path - and anyone around or near him has to make their choises on what path to follow - and those beyoud.So I say to anyone who wishes to give this book a try - I felt I was somehow obliged to leave a warning in advance stating this book is no good. I might wanna own a copy in the far future but I seeeeeeriously doupt if that copy'll do me any good at all. The study of Charles Manson is a direct look at our own innermost self reflection - and it depends upon each one of us whom it is being reflected in the mirror. That's why beauty is truly in the eyes of the beholder when it comes to do a serious analysis of the meaning behind the concept of the persona who is Charles Manson.

review/text: This book was a good book. It kept me want to read on and on. The only reason I gave it **** is because I got kind of confused during the middle of it. Here's my summary on the book:A teenage girl named Beth has to go with her mom and brother to stay with her mom's family. She has to leave behind her boyfriend, Ray, with whom she works at a stained glass store. Her mom ran away from home when she was 17 and hadn't been back since then. When they get to the house, Beth meets her crazy, drunk aunt named Iris. Iris severly dislikes Beth's mom, who's name is Hannah. Beth is not really sure why. In this book, Beth finds out what truly happened the night before Hannah ran away and why she did.This book leaves you hanging on the edge of your seat waiting to see what comes next!! Enjoy!!

review/text: The big boxoffice flop in '03 was 'League of Extraordinary Gentlemen', which was VERY loosely adapted from a comic book by Alan Moore. If you liked the movie or the comic, well, this is ten times better than both of 'em put together! The whole thing takes a 'What if?' look at the original Dracula novel, freely injecting any and everyone Newman can come up with into a great alternate timeline tale. Look for cameos from history and literature, from Sherlock Holmes to the Lone Ranger. Some of these references are oblique, some are blatant (probably for copyright reasons), but really, all that's fun and games, and it wouldn't mean diddly if the plot didn't deliver. And it does! This take on Jack the Ripper in a world of vampires is genuinely creepy at times, and the romance between the leads (A mysterious government operative and a beautiful vampire) works pretty well. I have the short story version of this story, and I think the novel is an even better story, with more plot twists and turns. It's kind of BUSY at times (I mean the book is crammed with plots and subplots) but Mr. Newman somehow keeps it all running smoothly. There are numerous sequels to this, but they aren't nearly as good. If you like tales of Saucy Jack, or if you just got tired of Anne Rice's pretty boy vamps a long time ago, you would probably enjoy this.

review/text: It's taken me quite a while to get around to reading this one, and I hesitate to review the first book of a trilogy when I haven't completed all 3 books, but I figured I'd better get this one in while I can, as it may take me another 10 years to finish the series.I'm surprised that it took me this long to finally read &quot;Foundation&quot; by Isaac Asimov, but I can say that I'm glad I did. Actually, I didn't have high hopes going into it, as I am not a big fan of Asimov's writing. While his technical approach is always entertaining, he tends to become very stilted and ham-fisted when it comes to characterization. It was this quality that turned me off of &quot;I Robot&quot; and almost got me to give him up completely; however, seeing as the Foundation trilogy is regarded as a classic of the genre, I had to give it a shot.As everyone has said over and over (and I'll do it, too), the Foundation trilogy is a futuristic parallel of the fall of the Roman Empire and the following Dark Ages. Hari Seldon, father of Psychohistory, sees the writing on the wall and establishes the Foundation in order to buffer the fall of civilization and technology. The first book of the series, &quot;Foundation&quot;, does a good job of setting the stage for what is to come. The book is told in 5 parts, each one focusing on a different character or time period in the early history of the Galactic Empire's fall. Surprising to me, Asimov actually does a fairly good job with his characterization. There's very little melodrama, and the story is evenly paced, holding up pretty well for a tale begun in 1941. The only complaints I have with the story are that the main characters always seem to be overly confident in themselves, as if they are holding all the cards and can easily handle any adversity while blindfolded (presenting a tense situation fails if the protagonist has no concern or doubt for how things will be resolved). Also, as the different parts of the story skip a hundred years here, 30 years there, etc., it may take some imagination on the reader's part to develop a &quot;big picture&quot; of what the Empire is really going through. These are minor issues, however, and should not detract from enjoying the book.One last observation - I have noticed that Hari Seldon appears to be getting younger with each new printing of this book. My copy of &quot;Foundation&quot; from the early '80s, with cover art by Darrell Sweet, shows a decrepit, bent, wizened Seldon (as I feel he should look). The next cover, by Michael Whelan from the early '90s, shows a more healthy and happy Seldon. The cover of the latest edition, shown on this page, features a Seldon who looks like he's about to jump out of his wheelchair and punch you out. You have to love that artistic license...

It's just plain fun--it makes you want to go make friends with a banjo player. The next best thing to having Eli Newberger, Butch Thompson and Jimmy Mazzy on your porch this summer would be to sit out there yourself with your boom box, your old rocking chair, a glass of iced tea, and this CD. The title of this recording is the same as that of a book by Newberger on the development of male character (Perseus, 1999). In the liner notes, Newberger cites a previous concert series &quot;Themes of Intimacy and Aggression,&quot; as using much of the same material as this recording, but one could simply characterize the men providing inspiration for these selections as &quot;bad guys and good guys,&quot; from &quot;Big Bad Bill,&quot; to being &quot;Wild About Harry.&quot; I can almost believe Jimmy Mazzy when he sings that he &quot;Ain't Misbehavin'.&quot;

review/text: After reading Professor. Lundberg's book it is difficult not to agree with his love for everything Greek! The author has spent much of his adult life in Greece and has a Greek wife, so he definitely knows what he is talking about.After a brief introduction where he describes the impact Greece had on him when he first arrived Professor Lundberg tells us how deeply rooted modern Greek culture is in the ancient Greek culture of the Homeric heroes. The first part of the book is about the hero Ulysses and how he travelled *to* Troy, and in the second part of the book the author and his family follows in the footsteps of Ulysses in modern Greece. Even though a lot has changed over the millenia, the landscapes and the culture are still more or less the same. The sea, the cliffs, the friendly and curious people, the food, the wine, and the fierce individualism of the Greek people.In Greece, in contrast to the rest of the Balkans, history is not divisive, or a weapon. for the Greeks it is a uniter, somehing that makes them comfortable with their own identity. Remember that Greece has a history at least as turbulent as the rest of the Balkans with foreign occupation, war, civil war, military dictatorships, and politicians as corrupt as any! There should be a lesson for us all here.The book is not a travel guide as such, but it will help a traveller who wants to get more than just the standard tourist sights.

review/text: You get tired of the same old romantic-adventures where the hero save the maiden and good prevails over evil. I read Jim Grimsley's DREAM BOY on recommendation from a friend in my theatre. I really enjoyed it, not so much because of the story but because of the style in which it was told. KIRITH KIRIN, much like DREAM BOY, gives you a sense of knowing the characters and growing with them. Though a little slow in the begining, once the story really got rolling I couldn't put it down. The world Grimsley has created is a complex in its peoples and history as Tolkien's Middle Earth. What I really enjoyed about this book, however, is the conflict between people; each character has the potential for good or evil, giving them each their own spirit and the ability to surprise you.The big battle near the end is not the preditcable climax of any other book that gives you a sense of closure. Rather, it makes you want to keep reading and wondering how the characters will continue the rest of their lives, and you miss them when the book is done. I wish there were a sequel, or a prequel, or something with the same characters.All in all, this is a great book for fantasy lovers of any persuasion, male or (as in my case) female.

All humanness is removed through war, poverty, suffering, and torture to make the population zombie like and easy to manipulate. The language is changed and all records, books, etc are abolished. The story although strange is thought provoking and does bring into question the human min and what being alive really means.

review/text: This is going to be a long review, but Clay deserves it. I'll just go track by track and then give you my thoughts at the end, mmkay? (Songs with an asterisk are ones that you should feel free to include on your next mix CD.)*1. Invisible: solid, solid track with a very catchy chorus--the kind that gets stuck in your head for two hours and you don't mind at all. It makes great use of Clay's voice in reverbs and stylistic background additions (can there ever be too much of his voice?). This is one of the best tracks; I'm glad it's first.2. I Will Carry You: another contagious chorus. This song was so hyped in articles on the Internet, though, that I kind of expected more from it. It contains &quot;stock&quot; lyrics (meaning you could buy them anywhere) but I like &quot;when the stars go blind,&quot; haven't heard that before. The song grows on your after about three listens.3. The Way: &quot;There's somethin' 'bout the way you look tonight&quot;--and then you can't resist continuing with &quot;never seen you shine so bright...&quot; which is a BAD thing. But the song has a lovely chorus which contains good use of harmonies. And--what the heck? Enrique Iglesias gets a writing credit? You just never know these days... I can see them trying to make this his next single (although I recommend track 12).4. When You Say You Love Me: this song is country-flavored, which is a nice change and Clay is, after all, a country boy. However, it's still down there on my list of favorites. Religious lyrics: &quot;if you wanna make God laugh, all you gotta do is tell him your plans&quot;--it's a great line.5. No More Sad Songs: a song with better lyrics overall than the previous four, especially lines like &quot;you are formally rejected.&quot; &quot;No more sad song&quot; (which is actually supposed to be the title) imitates a spontaneous emotion, which is cool. This song's a little more edgy, I suppose, but Clay only really digs into it once or twice. This should be more memorable, but it's not.6. Run To Me: not one of my favorites, and although there are more stock lyrics, I do like the story they tell. His voice sounds strained when he sings up high for some reason, and that really takes the song down a notch for me. Definitely one of the &quot;power ballads&quot; that critics were waiting to pounce on.*7. Shine: one of the way better ones. Another religious lyric refers to &quot;the sinner and the saint&quot; who fight the battle within; I really enjoy the &quot;church&quot; chord that plays after he says that; little things like that make a song better. It sounds more like a contemporary pop song than most on this CD, which he CAN do whether or not he believes it. This is one of the few songs where his singing is understated.8. I Survived You: again, much better lyrics in this song, especially in the chorus. But wait--Clay says &quot;I'll be damned&quot;!! What the--!9. This is the Night: yup, we've said all we can say about this one.10. Perfect Day: it's an ambitious song, trying to set a style with a heavy piano hook right in the middle of the chorus. But when he sings &quot;it's gonna be a perfect day,&quot; he really nails it, and gives the song some extra spike.11. Measure of a Man: again, his voice is a bit strained in the chorus, and I just can't fathom why. And again, low on that list. (I know, I know, he really wanted it on the CD, and that's cool and all...)*12. Touch: the best song on the album; they saved a great surprise for last. NEEDS TO BE his next single. I know a lot of his fans don't like contemporary pop, but this song--with a great hook and extra-cool beats--needs to be the blueprint for his next album. Clay just totally pulls this song off, and I always suspected he could do this! David Eriksson, the song's producer, is a genuis, and I'm so glad he believed in Clay enough to do this. The chorus is again contagious, and reminiscent of Enrique Iglesias' &quot;Rhythm Divine,&quot; only this song is not nearly as grandiose, which is great. When Clay fades away with &quot;girl, 'cause your touch is so right,&quot; he really feels it and it doesn't sound strange at ALL. I know I'm going on and on, but this track is as near as it gets to groundbreaking.So--on with the &quot;not so good&quot; stuff: there are too many songs showing off his upper range and not enough time spent making his great low range fuller and more resonant. The choruses are more memorable than the verses in almost all the songs, and it doesn't have to be that way--see Kelly Clarkson's &quot;Low,&quot; Pink's &quot;Just Like a Pill,&quot; Alanis's &quot;Ironic.&quot;The &quot;good&quot; stuff: Clay's voice alone makes it worth playing the whole CD through every time. He CAN do contemporary pop, as evidenced by &quot;Invisible,&quot; &quot;Shine,&quot; and &quot;Touch&quot; (see a pattern?). In terms of overall, it's as neatly put together and consistent as another great album, Daniel Bedingfield's &quot;If You're Not the One.&quot; I really want the best for Clay, and I'm so glad that he's proven to me (if not the critics who yearn sexy cookies) that he can do more than we thought. Except rap. Never rap, Clay.His next album: so, I already said that songs in the vein of &quot;Touch&quot; need greater play time next time around. I'm thinking--5 songs like &quot;Touch&quot; and &quot;Invisible&quot;, 4 beautiful ballads, and 2 or 3 that experiment, like have him only accompanied by a guitar on one, and have him sing another song entirely a capella (that would just blow me away). Clay, the future can really &quot;shine&quot; if you let it.

review/text: This is certainly an entertaining novel, and it will keep you turning the pages. But Ms Gregory has a few of the facts a little muddled, and as history is always stranger than fiction, I do have to wonder why she chose to change anything about this fantastic story. For example, Ann was Mary's younger sister, not elder, and this may have put quite a different spin on their relationship. Mary's son Henry was her first born child, not second. And finally, there was absolutely no evidence that Ann ever committed incest with her brother George, and the book hints very heavily that this was indeed what happened.I guess we can just pass this off as historical fiction, and Ms Gregory certainly does do this well, painting a vivid image of Ann as a young woman who gambled all and lost, and endangered her family in the process. But this was a well documented time in history, and whereas I am willing to give historical authors a lot of leeway with characterisation, I do like my facts to be right.It is a ripping tale all right, and it is well written, but I still found myself disappointed with the liberties taken with the facts.

review/text: Infamous Scribblers: The Founding Fathers and the Rowdy Beginnings of American Journalism is the eye-popping true story of how raucous and undisciplined American journalism once was. Feuds, partisanship, and outright lies often colored journalism of the era. Some founding fathers, such as Ben Franklin, Alexander Hamilton, and Sam Adams, were leading journalists, others, such as George Washington and John Adams, passionately disdained journalists; and Thomas Jefferson was a skillful manipulator of journalists. Infamous Scribblers is divided into three sections: "The Role of Authority", "The Approach of War", and "The Tumult of Peace", all tracing the contentious relationship between the founding fathers and journalism throughout the birth of America. Highly recommended for American history shelves, and an absolute "must-have" for public and college libraries.

review/text: $10, come on! Asian children must have really sweated these out. Labor concerns aside, these sheets do the job and are worth the $10. However, no one in their right mind would pay the retail price if they felt them first hand.These are soft enough but nothing about them is at all luxurious. The top sheet runs narrow and quite long and the pillow cases are on the small side. The sheets do fit my queen size futon and average size pillows but I'd recommend getting the King size and just shrinking them some in the wash.The print is nice, I was pleasently suprised, the earthtone colors keep it from being way too girly. With a green or blue cover these could look classy and even work well for a man.

But I felt that it was also an honest look at friendships/realtionships. It explored the busyness in all of our lives that bring us to overlooking the needs and feeliings of our friends and unitentially taking them forgranted, no matter how solid and close the friendship. This book ends with a sweet yet subtle reminder that true and successful friendhsips take vulernability and and self-less-ness.

The phone numbers, websites, prices, business hours, and detailed descriptions were extremely useful in booking and planning our daily activities. The mile by mile outline of points of interests in The Seward Highway: a Road Guide (Chapter 8 Section 2) and Out from Anchorage: Turnagain Arm & Portage Glacier (Chapter 7 Section 8) made our rental car drive from Anchorage to Seward one of our trip's highlights.

review/text: After reading Murray's book, even the most skeptical reader will be tempted to take up the craft of writing - at least as a hobby! At the same time, Murray teaches important attitudes, skills, and techniques involved in writing a variety of genres and in getting published, so the book also appeals to those interested in writing professionally.Murray's appeal to such a diverse audience begins with his development of an intimate relationship with the reader in the introduction entitled &quot;Why I Write.&quot; The reader can easily imagine having a cup of coffee with Murray while he shares the story of his birth as a writer and what motivates him to continue his writing life.But it's not just about him. With charming candor, Murray invites readers to explore the possibilities of a writing life for themselves. While encouraging us to overcome our fear of writing and to develop a writing discipline, Murray comes across as a combination fairy Godmother and Olympic training coach. His maternal tone urges us to give ourselves &quot;permission to write&quot; and provides comforting advice. Yet, like a coach, he also expects us to challenge ourselves, set goals, and stop making excuses for not writing.The first few chapters of the book also focus on &quot;cultivating a writing habit&quot; and provide tips on self-motivation, attitude, subject matter, elements of voice and discovery through keeping an open mind.Once he has his readers convinced of the personal joys and benefits of the craft and confident in their own potential as writers, Murray shifts the focus to teaching techniques for the specific genres of essay, fiction, and poetry. These chapters may easily be used as springboards for writing exercises that are non-intimidating and likely to produce exciting results.In addition, Murray generously shares samples of his own early drafts with crossed-out lines, notes in the margins and detailed discussions of why he made the changes he made. Anyone who thinks that professional writers simply sit down, receive inspiration and then spontaneously produce masterpieces will learn a lesson from Murray about the energy and commitment involved in the craft of writing.Every step of the way, Murray displays rigorous honesty about himself as a writer, about the joys and struggles of the writer's life and about what it takes to please a reading audience.The book ends with a discussion of the revision process and the usefulness of sharing our writing with a community of others who take the craft seriously. These companions can help us stay motivated, provide feedback about what works, catch mistakes and provide inspiration.If you are interested in a writing career, Murray's last chapters will also help you understand the relationship between writers and editors, how to plan a book and how to prepare a manuscript for publication.However, you need not be a serious writer to enjoy this experience with Murray. He probably will convince you that you need to write at least for yourself, but even if you remain opposed to the idea, you are bound to feel a deeper understanding and appreciation of the writing process.

review/text: Having read only one other Higgins book before (Cold Harbor), I hesitate, somewhat, to comment on the author's general talent. However, this book has to be one of the worst I've read in some time. I think the thing that got me the most was the dialog; unbelievably simplistic and totally formulaic. &quot;Damn, he said to Kate, &quot;It's the Hazar Scouts, &quot; Puhleeze! Not even an exclamation mark. Many other examples could be given. Now, assuming for the moment that the dialog was, say, written at greater than a 7th grade level, the plot is almost as bad. The protagonists' reactions to their fellows getting knocked off one-by-one is almost comic. There's no depth here; just one simple vignette after another. I wouldn't even want to compare this to Ludlum or Clancy (although Clancy's gotten a bit rough of late).A terrific waste of a good

review/text: I recommend this film, but I think it could have been better. We need maps-- Where are the landmarks-- Red Barricades. Crossing 62. The Tractor Factory. The Brickworks. The only landmark we hear of in all three hours, other than the airstrips, is "the basement of a department store." Surely the script allowed for mention of the well-known landmarks. Viewers who have read a book on Stalingrad will feel lost.The narrator tells us that the airstrips are overrun-- then later we hear of Ju-52s landing at Pitomnik and Gumrak-- So after Kalach, there are other airstrips-- where are the maps that show what's going on? And how many times do we need to hear that the airstrips were chaotic? Seems like we heard that about every five minutes throughout the last two episodes. Was the story about the four officers in white fur coats believable?-- Forcing the pilot at gunpoint to leave the 17 wounded on the ground and take off with only the four officers? What goes through a pilot's mind at that point-- how about: "If they shoot me, how are they then going to get away?" Must we hear about this one flight, and not the thousands of others? I'm sure there were better examples than that, to make whatever point the directors were trying to make-- which seems to be that the Wehrmacht officer corps were all cowards.There are other good sources on Stalingrad. Read The Forsaken Army, by Heinrich Gerlach. See the 1993 German film 'Stalingrad' first. See Pekinpah's Cross of Iron, see The Winter War (Talvisota) 1989, directed by Parikka. Also Come and See (1989), directed by Klimov. Read Willi Heinrich. Read Heinrich B&ouml;ll. Read Barbarossa by Alan Clark. Read The Hinge of Fate by Winston Churchill. Read Anthony Beevor. Read The Road to Stalingrad by Benno Zieser.

It seemed as if Mr. Patterson stopped by a bar one night and jotted it down on a napkin! It should have been labeled as no more than a short story.I believe the last time I read a book with such a large font, two inch margin on all four sides and less than 200 words per page ---- I was in the third grade!! New chapters were used as a way of extending the story/number of pages --- they were not used as a means to express a new idea or thought.Take my advice -- do not waste your time or money.

review/text: Does anyone remember seeing a movie called BABE? Maybe about 15 years, or so, ago? It is a story about Babe, a pig who is raised by sheepdogs, and learns to herd sheep, with a little help from Farmer Hoggett, played by James Cromwell.I have never been able to forget that mean cat in this movie who said to Babe, "You don't have a purpose."Worse than that? The look on Babe's face when she realized she had no purpose - that was a killer. Babe was perfectly happy before being asked that question but suddenly was so deflated. That cat was really a rotten cat! Or was she? Maybe Babe needed this incident, cruel as it was, to make her desire a purpose!There is a wonderful barnyard filled with animals, all with a purpose. All delightful. Do you remember James Cromwell, the farmer?I am writing a story on Finding Your Purpose and using the song James Cromwell sang . . . If I Had Words. I think seeing this scene reminds me of how excited GOD might have been right after he created Adam. Having foreknowledge does not mean you can't be happy and excited (in the moment) when something wonderful happens. Cromwell has dust on his finger nails from working on the farm; the LORD God formed man of dust from the ground so would he have had dust on his fingernails? Imagine that!This movie, aside from entertaining, made me think a lot about having a purpose and what my purpose was. What a great teaching tool that was for me! Everyone is born with a purpose and gifted for that purpose from his or her mother's womb. We often miss it but we wander around a lifetime until we find it - that is, if we keep seeking for happiness and being fully alive.God gave Adam a purpose right off - he gives us all a purpose built in - a chip? maybe in the soul? maybe? But he gave us a purpose and will have given us the gifts to fulfill that purpose. We should all look for that purpose!One day, maybe today, he will rejoice over us with singing - Zephaniah 3:17 The LORD, your God, is in your midst, a warrior who gives victory; he will rejoice over you with gladness, he will renew you* in his love; he will exult over you with loud singing as on a day of festival.Surely he will when we find our purpose and use it.Go track down If I Had Words and be entertained by James Cromwell.

review/text: I purchased this set of pans the day after Thanksgiving at 5am. I wanted a nice set of pans and did a lot of research. I found that this set was one of the better sets given the price, it was on sale at Bed Bath & Beyond plus I had a 20% discount coupon that made it all worth it. It also included a Bonus set in which I received a 5QT sauteuse pan w/lid, a 7 qt stockpot w/lid, and a 6 piece spatula/spoon set. I ended up only paying like $200 for everything.I have used this set daily, I have a family of 6 and cook every single day and night. I have a gas stove and wow what a difference in cooking and heating. I had a cheaper set before and it didn't matter how low I had the heat everything burned in the middle of the pan. It's amazing how well everything cooks, I can actually turn the heat up a little more and still nothing burns or sticks even with out oil. I can cook more and better then ever.I like that these pans are really quite heavy but the big 12 inch sauteuse pan has 2 handles and really is easy to hold on to with both handles. I like that the handles don't get hot unless you accidentally touch the metal part up by the pan. I also like that I can see what's cooking inside with the glass lids. You do have to hand wash them but it's real easy to do since everything just wipes out easily. Who has room in their dishwasher anyway for such big pans? I don't even have 1 scratch in them as of yet. Overall I am really glad I was able to purchase this set of pans. I wouldn't trade them for anything.I hope you enjoy them as much as I do!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

review/text: This is the &#34;classic&#34; old translation by Louis Mercier most of us read and loved. But a good bit of the novel was left out, not so much that the story was greatly altered, but still not as Verne wrote it and intended it to be. Fortunately, there is another free public domain version available which I would encourage you to also download and read; this is a modern translation by F. P. Walter and it is unabridged. It may be found in the Kindle store by typing: Vingt Mille Lieues Sous Les Mers English (or simply: Verne Vingt Mille English). The title is French but don't worry, the book is entirely in English with an informative introduction by Walter. This great new translation is wordier than the old one, but it comes as close, in English, to what Verne actually wrote in French--and it is complete. I would strongly urge you to compare them--especially if you are a true Jules Verne fan.

review/text: There have been many screen adaptations of Romeo and Juliet over the years. Some of them played by some of Hollywood's top actors and actresses. There was even the Romeo and Juliet last done by Leonardo DiCaprio and Claire Danes, which to my mind is simply Romeo and Juliet on steroids.None of them have come close to matching the magic of Franco Zeffirelli's screen adaptation. For the first time, he made sure to cast the two roles as close to the true ages of Romeo and Juliet as possible. During the time of filming, Olivia Hussey was 15, and Leonard Whiting was 16. He also made sure to keep the Shakespearean language intact. I mean, is it even possible to change Shakespeare's words into something better? It may be a challenge at first to understand the language, especially if you are not used to hearing it. I recommend that you watch it with the subtitles on, or if you want, get a copy of the play and follow it that way. It might makes things a little easier.It's one thing to memorize Shakespearean lines in a play, but something else entirely to actually act them out. Consider this as you watch these two young actors not only succeed in both areas, but surpass all expectations. After watching this film, you might have a hard time thinking of anyone else to fill these roles.Most everyone probably knows the storyline of two star-crossed lovers who who share a forbidden love due to the on-going feuds of their two families who solve their problems with swords and brawls in the streets of Verona. How then is it possible for Romeo and Juliet to conceive of being together, let alone married? How is the love of their respective children able to heal the rift of these two families?Perhaps, argueably, no other writer throughout history understood the power of unconditional love and is able to somehow give the reader at least an idea of what love is through words. Juliet's infamous line captures the essence of Shakespeare's understanding of love when she says, "my bounty is as boundless as the sea. The more I give to thee, the more I have, for both are infinite." Shakespeare knew that true, unconditional love must be let go, or given, because the more you give, the more you actually have, for you cannot give what you do not have.Aside from the abilities of Leonard Whiting and Olivia Hussey, I also have to recognize the talents of John McHenry as the loveable and poetic Mercutio. He is brilliant, and his fight in the streets with Tybalt is both humorous and tragic, especially when he's trying to convince everyone that he's been mortally wounded, but no one takes him seriously until his final fall from the steps of the building.Franco Zeffirelli is renowned for his film sets, and finding the perfect locations to shoot. Verona looks perfect, as if Zeffirelli pulled it straight from the mind of Shakespeare himself.Film critic Roger Ebert was actually in Italy and walking by during the shooting of the balcony scene. This has to be my favorite scene in the entire movie as Romeo and Juliet profess their unswerving love and feelings for each other.Granted that due to time, there are some scenes that are not in the film, but Zeffirelli takes what is crucial to keep the film and story moving. For example, Paris is more or less in the background, and the fight between he and Romeo is not in this adaptation. Nor is the scene where Romeo visits the Apothecary to get the vial of poison for himself.As with just about every successful film, you must have the music to capture the feelings and emotions for the audience, and Nino Rota's score is one of the most famous and recognized in film history, as he uses his music to truly capture both the love and the tragedy of Romeo and Juliet. The film soundtrack on CD is nice because it contains the dialogue of the film to go with the music.This is truly a film classic. Some viewers may think that this version isn't as "cool" as the updated version, what with our actors running around in Renaissance Era tights, but then, tell me which other film version captures so eloquently what might arguably be Shakespeare's most famous tragedy? Romeo and Juliet has been adapted for film more than any other Shakespearean play. Perhaps this, alone, says why we are so drawn by this story, for as the narrator so perfectly expresses at the end, "has there ever been a story of more woe, then this of Juliet and her Romeo."

review/text: Books are dangerous. They're full of ideas that make people think about the world, feel passion, and perhaps act out. That's not good for society; it causes conflict, uprising, and interference with the status quo. People who read and think scare people who don't, so most citizens have happily given up the right to decide what to think about and now let the government fill their brains with constant loud mindless entertainment. This managed input has equalized society; nobody feels inferior to anyone else and there's no conflict anymore. Dull minds, constant entertainment, and conformity make society run smoothly.Guy Montag works as a fireman. He burns books at night while his wife sits in her parlor and listens to inane media shows at high volume. But Clarice, the teenager next door, is different. Her family sits around and talks. They discuss things and they laugh with each other. Guy wonders what they talk about as he watches his wife talk to the strangers on TV and pop sleeping pills...Ray Bradbury's Fahrenheit 451 presents a possible frightening future in which intellectual pursuits and nonconformity are deemed dangerous and subversive. It's been more than half a century since Fahrenheit 451 was published and we've seen censorship laws actually become looser over the years and the advent of the internet has brought on the current "information age." But that doesn't make Fahrenheit 451 irrelevant because it's about much more than literary censorship. It's about freedom of speech and individual rights. It's about thinking for ourselves and what might happen if we let the government tell us what we can see, hear, or own.Fahrenheit 451 resonates with me on so many levels. First of all, it's just superbly written. I love Bradbury's intense style which translates especially well on Blackstone Audio's version read by Christopher Hurt (sample). Here he describes the show that Mrs Montag watches all day:A great thunderstorm of sound gushed from the walls. Music bombarded him at such an immense volume that his bones were almost shaken from their tendons; he felt his jaw vibrate, his eyes wobble in his head. He was a victim of concussion. When it was all over he felt like a man who had been thrown from a cliff, whirled in a centrifuge and spat out over a waterfall that fell and fell into emptiness and emptiness and never -- quite -- touched -- bottom -- never -- never -- quite -- no not quite -- touched -- bottom ... and you fell so fast you didn't touch the sides either... never... quite... touched... anything.The thunder faded. The music died."There," said Mildred. And it was indeed remarkable. Something had happened. Even though the people in the walls of the room had barely moved, and nothing had really been settled, you had the impression that someone had turned on a washing-machine or sucked you up in a gigantic vacuum. You drowned in music and pure cacophony. He came out of the room sweating and on the point of collapse. Behind him, Mildred sat in her chair and the voices went on again...Second, I share Bradbury's ardent passion for knowledge and learning. The thought of lost information, burned books, mindless entertainment, meaningless small-talk, conformity, and intellectual malaise makes my stomach twist. I don't believe that we're in danger of the anti-intellectualism that Bradbury posits, but still his ideas get me riled up.Third, I'll admit that I'm a rebel at heart. While I recognize that obeying laws and paying taxes are a necessary part of living in a well-functioning society, I feel mostly distrustful and suspicious when the government increases taxes, takes over more functions in society, tells us what to believe, and tries to revoke constitutional freedoms. In this context, Bradbury's possible future doesn't seem so impossible anymore.I'm pleased that my school district assigns Fahrenheit 451 in its middle-school curriculum, though I find it a bit ironic that some publishers have edited the language to make it more "suitable" for teenagers.

review/text: I had looked forward to this book, as I enjoyed "The Romanov Prophecy" as a fun summer read. Unfortunately, Berry's allowed his religious and social views to turn his latest book into a screed. The hero's antagonist is a cardinal that believes in priestly celibacy and other traditional Catholic dogma, which makes him not merely wrong-headed but a scheming, blackmailing, cartoon villain who does everything but twirl his mustache as he ties the heroine to railroad tracks. The "secret" that Barry's concocted is intended to be "provocative" in the model of "The Da Vinci Code," but instead the revelation manages to be both hilarious and (there's no other word for it) blasphemous at once.

Really I do just want to point out that Larry Potter was copyrighted far before Harry Potter and that by saying it is a copycat is highly inaccurate and unfair. They are entirely different types of stories and styles and are aimed at entirely different audiences. So, if you are planning to buy this book for someone over the age of 5, they probably will not find it very entertaining. Otherwise, it's a great book for early readers.

review/text: Great Read!Pararescue, by Michael Hirsh, is one of the most thoroughly researched contemporary military history novels I have read. As a Marine officer, I am critical of books, movies, and articles about the military when they don't &quot;get it right.&quot; I couldn't find one obvious inaccuracy in this book, which tells me Mr. Hirsh was very careful in his examination of the Air Force Pararescue community, and of the little-known USMC KC-130 aerial refueling tanker community.Most interesting to me was the comparison of the philosophies of the helicopter crews of the 102nd Rescue Squadron, and that of the Marines of Yanky 03 - the Marine tanker crew from VMGR-452. Their attitudes and beliefs seemed to be identical - &quot;Whatever it takes to get the job done.&quot; By contrast, the mind-set of the Air Force C-130 tanker crews seemed to be &quot;Whatever excuse we can find to get out of this dangerous mission&quot; and &quot;What about our crew rest?&quot; Strange that the &quot;factions&quot; mentioned in this story would be Air Force Helicopter crews and Marine on one side, and Air Force C-130 crews on the other.Air Force LtCol Fleming, the Flight-lead of the 102 Rescue Squadron's H-60 Blackhawk rescue team, and the true hero of the book, should have been a Marine. Coming from a Marine, that is the ultimate compliment. Clint Eastwood should play his part in the movie version of this book.

Many times a shop might sell the Anna Riva oils or oils with a similar name but have no description of what work to do with the oil. This book gives the reader some basics relating to that work. All in all for the price it's not bad.

review/text: This is a condensed and abridged book covering most of Europe. It gives you the highlights of the countries of Western Europe. It is a good book if you planning a trip where you will spend a day or two in many places. Otherwise you should consider DK more comprehensive guides to a particular country, region or city. On the positive side the book covers several countries that DK does not have a guide for yet. On the down side, the only Eastern European countries covered are Poland, the Czech Republic, and Hungary. Also the book is heavy. Is the book worth the money? Only if you are taking a &quot;buffet&quot; tour of Europe (a little France, a little Italy, etc...).

review/text: When I was looking for what I needed one day, my psychic sense led me to this book. My analytical side wasn't satisfied until I had compared it with others on the subject, but I came back to this book for its personal stories and practical approach. Sonia Choquette is a professional psychic who has been expanding and refining her own awareness for over 25 years. She's been successfully teaching others for over 20 years how to become more aware of the psychic impressions available to all of us. But the best aspect of this book is the personal tone the author has instilled. There's nothing mystical or pretentious about Sonia, and there's nothing dry or clinical about this book. When I read it, I felt as if Sonia were here herself, telling the engrossing, often amazing stories from her life and the lives of her clients and students, and guiding and encouraging me along my own psychic pathway. She has a gift for clarity, understanding and teaching the essentials without any fluff or bluff. She shows us that the extraordinary is an ordinary part of our everyday world, and seeing the magic simply requires a new and more discerning viewpoint. Whether you want to increase your intuitive skills or are just fascinated by tales of psychics and the supernatural, you're going to love this book. My personal psychic pathway over the eight years since I first read this book has been profoundly astounding and life-changing, and I'm thankful to Sonia Choquette for her help and guidance.

It was missing from her duet album a few years ago and this collection finally includes it. There are many songs making this a memorable compilation since Emmylou leaves her mark on every song she collaborates on, even for background vocals only. Since it would be tough to buy all the individual cd's everything is on, this is a find to someone who loves her work.

review/text: This book has two major problems.One, its title is misleading. You think you are getting a quick, shortened version of an economics class, but what you are really getting is a conservative, free market view of the economy. If the title had been, Reasons Why The Free Market Is Better For The Economy, I would have a lot less problem with this book. Balanced, Hazlitt is not, and he takes a lot of potshots at Keynes with only the occasional quick nod to the problems the free market can run into. It's not that I disagree with a lot of his arguments, it's that you don't get both sides.Two, it's out of date. It was written in the 1940's. Oh, it's been updated alright. In the 1970's. A lot of economic events have occurred since the 1970's and the conservative view has some explaining to do.If you really want a balanced view of the economy you can check out &lt;50 Economic Ideas You Really Need to Know>. It's balanced, although a bit scatter shot. For a pretty balanced book, but with a left lean, try &lt;Economics Explained> by Heilbroner and Thurow, it tells a more cohesive story than 50 Ideas.

review/text: A few years ago there was a HK movie called Lady in Heat that became a hit- why? Mainly due to the lesbian scenes involving Penthouse HK star Miho Nomoto and Rebecca Chang (spelled Rebeca on the box, not sure which is correct). Because of this, a &quot;photo album&quot; of sorts was whipped up starring both Nomoto and Chang.The packaging of this video just screams &quot;hey! lesbian content!&quot;, peppered with shots from the Lady in Heat scenes. I got this specifically because I liked Lady in Heat, and there were vignettes within the film that indicated there were more scenes that hadn't been used.Unfortunately, they aren't in here. This is a series of vignettes illustrating photo shoots and the like, with the girls mostly apart. When they're together, they're very posed and still- not interacting, and really not doing anything sensual. It does explain away some of the &quot;glamour&quot; shots that were used on the promo postcards included with the HK DVD release of LiH.The few lesbian scenes in this are shots from Lady in Heat, and are cut up; nothing new for the LiH fan, and too incomplete to be of much use for the lesbian-scene fan.Overall a very soft-focus lingering look at both Miho and Rebecca, like something from the early Playboy videos- very tame- in fact, nothing below the waist is ever shown. Worth it for the Miho fan (of which there are a few.) Might also create a few Rebecca fans- she's really cute and it *is* nice to have a bit more with her, even if it's just topless cavorting.Other miscellaneous complaints: The mastering of the video leaves something to be desired; the scenes where Miho's standing in front of venetian blinds and the camera goes in or out glitches quite a bit. The promo postcards present in the HK release aren't included here. The nave-voiced narration is hard to hear over the cheesy synth music, and when it can be heard, is incredibly banal. The quality is basically that of a higher-quality camcorder, which makes the cuts to the film-based Lady in Heat clips jarring.

review/text: Fahrenheit 451 is a book about firemen burning books. The story is quite fascinating but the way Bradbury works it along is a little confusing. The storyline- Guy Montag is a fireman who burns books and is very proud of his job, that is until one day he meets a girl named Clarrisse and an old man. The story is basically what he decides to do in order to find out why books were banned and what is inside a book that leads people to love them or hate them. The confusing part of this book is that it leaves you thinking &quot;Ok, What just happened?&quot;. I recall that more than once I had to re-read a page 4 times and still couldn't figure out what happened. I'm guessing that the reason this book is so confusing is that it takes place in the future yet sometimes it seems so old (probably because it was written awhile ago). You sit there thinking &quot;Is this the real world (in the novel) or are they discussing the past, or are they discussing the future?&quot;. If you happen to watch the movie of Fahrenheit 451, watch it after you read the book, or better yet, don't watch it at all. The movie is different in many, many ways, including names and plot.

review/text: I happened upon this album because I heard "Sugar" (or whatever that song is called) played on KROQ and my musical tastes changed forever. The album is a revolutionary breakthrough in musical expression, combining the experimentation of greats like Frank Zappa with the melodic ability of Nat King Cole. The mind-force that created this music (the collective apparatus that is the intellectual force behind System) is absolute genius. Every grunt, note, sound effect and scream is perfectly woven into the fabric that assaults the ears.I have friends who hate this album as they cannot get past the staccato resonance of some of the more popular songs, but in my humble opinion, these only add to the total experience that is Toxicity. This may well be System's masterpiece - although we can hope they find ways to outdo themselves in the future. The Bonus DVD was a nice surprise and at the time of my purchase it was available at the same price.

I didn't really miss Megan Fox, but the new girl didn't add to much to the movie either. The action was very good as were the scenes, but I felt they could have shaved at least 30 minutes off the movie and still came out with the same results. I did think the beginning of the movie was more interesting than the end.

This boils down to the fact that you need to start making noise 5 or 6 seconds before you say anything that will be heard on the other end.The sport club that I belong to, makes heavy use of the sub channels (there are so many people using FRS type radios now... you REALLY shouldn't bother buying anything that doesn't have sub channels).From the reviews I've read, these guys have come a LONG way from their early models. However, without the sub channels, and with such a delay in the VOX feature... it's a neat "toy," but they still have a bit more to go before they become truly useful.-D

review/text: The overall presentation of the Midway campaign is accurate but this movie was made on the cheap and it shows. The plight of Heston's son and his Japanese American girlfriend shows a real problem that existed but is poorly integrated into the plot.The real problem is the combat footage, almost all of which was stolen from elsewhere and stuck in with no sense of responsibility. First, don't use recognizable footage from one of the best WWII films made, Tora, Tora, Tora, especially using the very recognizable P40, an army plane not used at Midway, taking off against a mountainous background just after you've used a long shot showing that Midway was a flat atoll. Second, pay attention to what you just showed -- do not show a single seat fighter crashing just after you've shown the interior of a three seat plane getting shot up. Don't mix dive bombing (steep angle) and glide bombing (shallow angle)shots and do not!! show an extrior of the plane pulling out of a dive and then flip back to a studio shot showing the cockpit still pitched at a downward angle.Finally, the Yorktown was not hit by a kamikaze so don't use the footage of the USS Franklin getting hit late in the war.You don't have to be the type of military buff who can tell the different versions of a plane by small details to notice this kind of corner cutting. Instead of competing with Tora Tora Tora, the makers of Pearl Harbor should have remade this one.

To the film's credit, even in my drunken stupor I could tell that the scenes in which Piper pretends to sing were incredibly corny.

review/text: Life was hard and times were no joke in the economically blighted cities and wind-blasted rural areas that marked a Depression era America. Whatever joy most Americans grasped for seemed to be just beyond their collective reaches. In OF MICE AND MEN John Steinbeck portrays a people who are just as blighted as the land on which they trod. Lennie Small and George Milton are two migrants who are forced to wander the midwest in search of the American Dream, which, to them, meant a place of their own. Each recognizes that this dream will, in all likelihood, remain just that, an evanescent will-o-the-wisp that leaves them with little else but to talk about it. Many times in the novel, the huge but retarded Lennie asks George, a smallish but bright thinker, to rhapsodize about their future. To George, their American Dream is a place where no one can throw them out. To Lennie, it is a place where he can raise rabbits. And it is not only Lennie and George who reach out for the unobtainable. It is arguable that nearly everyone else has their own competing dreams, with the same chance of success as Lennie and George have--none at all. The ranch hands where Lennie and George find roustabout jobs are the hopeless in search of the unobtainable. Candy is a one-armed elderly worker who seeks security for his old age. Crooks is a proud black worker who searches for racial equality in an age that did not know the term. Curley is a nastily pugnacious man who spends most of the scenes in which he appears in a hopeless and helpless Holy Grail search for his wife who spends an equal amount of time staying out of his way. And then there is Curley's wife, who is so bereft of identity that Steinbeck chooses not even to give her a name. She wanders the book like a meandering Eve, seeking only to disrupt the ordered lives of the men around her. In her search for meaning to her life, she collides with a corresponding search by Lennie for meaning in his. When she places Lennie's unthinking paws on her hair and dress, Lennie panics and unthinkingly stifles her, setting off a chain of events that forces George to play with Lennie's dream of a rabbit warren as a tearfully tragic prelude to ending that dream. In OF MICE AND MEN, Steinbeck catches not only the gritty edginess of political and emotional instability that then was ripping apart the social fabric of a pre-World War II America, he was also telling a timeless tale that suggests that for dreams to transform to reality, those dreamers had better leave the world of dreams long enough to weigh the balance of cost versus benefit. For Lennie, for Curley's wife, the price was way too high.

review/text: Words fail. Inspiration overflows.There is a reason that so many musicians - and non-musicians - hold this album in awe to this day.In my own humble opinion, there simply are no recordings that approach this by anyone I have ever heard. The sheer power of this music overwhelms all who can hear something of what it says. It is from the soul, but not sloppily, not "free", not randomly. It is music by absolute masters at the absolute peak of their powers. They have been assembled by their musical and spiritual leader to give thanks directly to God - whatever form that may take - with nothing between them and that "audience." What they create, what they unleash, are 4 movements of overwhelming candor, of unrivaled expressiveness. The minor blues forms are deceptively simple, hypnotic at times, but these four are masters of the blues, and the Tower of Babel they assemble on that unshakable foundation succeeds in reaching the heavens.It almost trivializes the accomplishment of this recording to praise the stunning technical mastery on display by Coltrane, Tyner, Garrison, and Jones. Rhythms fly on and off the mainline, but remain unfailingly - and at times astonishingly - true to the time. Listen to Elvin's rim shots in the first movement, amid the blurring polyrythmic overlays.This is primal scream, prayer, and devotion by geniuses. It is Picasso's Guernica, Michelangelo's David. It is my first and only nominee for greatest American contribution to world culture.For those who can't hear it, don't blame the album. Try to listen and learn the language. If it continues to make you uncomfortable, then consider the possibility that things that reach your soul hit too close to home.

Written some 70 years prior to the discovery of the Dead Sea Scrolls, Alfred Edersheim's great work still offers highly valuable-and detailed-information on the Gospel and related events. One of the more striking features of this book is the appendix section which gives a list of 400+ Old Testament passages which were tagged by the ancient rabbis as messianically applied. An absolute must for any who wish to study the Jewish expectations of the coming of Messiah surrounding the days when the Carpentar from Nazareth walked the Earth. Place Edersheim's great work in your library, and you will find yourself going back to it time and time again.

Although it is focused toward the wandering teen, it's ideas are too scarce. The ideas within are not necessarily focused to any one religion, but a mix of all the different aspects that the author has put together as wicca. This is a choice that is made by the practicioner, and nowhere in this book does it stress this opinion.For those who would like some fun reading about what fantasy religion could be, this would be the book for you. For those who really need some insight into pagan or wiccan religion/spirituality should look elsewhere.

Most of the music in the movie was terrible in choice; the only part of this movie that i liked was the very end scene where the ghost climbs out of the body. This movie didn't hold my interest at all; it was wandering, mumbling, eating, avoiding. How could you make a film about Kurt Cobain, the man who made grunge, so terrible?

The film does follow the book for most of it, but the director has certain parts. He has tried to improve the plot, but after reading the book, it somewhat makes the plot worse.This is a reasonable conversion, children and people who haven't read the book will find it an average cartoon but for people that have read it will find it disappointing because the main characters are missing, main parts are missing, and some parts are randomly changed.

review/text: Prior to actually reading it, my understanding of Bonfire was that it's one of those "must reads" for any self proclaimed American bibliophile because it is a landmark piece of cultural satire. Now that I've read it I can say that in no way does this book live up to ANY of its hype.Although this is not the first time this has happened, it never ceases to irritate me when I walk away from a book with no actual "walk aways", ie, "what a GREAT story!" or "did not see that twist coming", or "I need a moment alone...those sex scenes were ridiculous!" After finish Bonfire, my only thought was, "ok, so what?" The story takes place in NYC circa the 80's. The focal character is a quintessential, self made yuppie, Wall Street bonds trader whose life comes crumbling down after he's involved in an unfortunate late night encounter in the Bronx, apparently the borough from hell during this decade. What ensues is a strange smattering of social clich&eacute;s with little cultural context (I would've loved more references to the political and pop culture landscapes of the time) and zero character development. I suppose you could draw some parallels with greed of Wall Street then to the all out corruption of Wall Street today but when the author seemingly has no opinion about it, there is nothing the reader can do with it.In short, this is 685 pages you could be spending elsewhere.

Not since the incomparable Michael Bolton have I EVER heard anyone infuse their music with such an exquisite blend of power, honesty, vulnerability and sensitivity!

Given his flawless interpretive skills, with every heartfelt lyric, listeners are truly transported to another place. &quot;Run to Me,&quot; &quot;I Survived You,&quot; and &quot;No More Sad Songs&quot; are PERFECT examples of this. Like Bolton, Aiken has an AMAZING instinct for what songs fit his voice, an ability that takes some singers years to acquire. More power to Clay for being able to exercise that ability so early in what I know will be a lifelong career!

review/text: Welcome to Hammer's outstanding &quot;Hands of the Ripper&quot;, one of the studio's last movies and one of their best. The story tells of Anna, a young girl who is actually Jack the Ripper's daughter, and who was traumatised as a toddler by witnessing a vicious killing (seen in the prologue). Now an adult, she is prone to murderous seizures which provide the many grisly highlights of the film. It sounds rather lurid, but the film takes the subject seriously, and as a whole, the plot is tremendously engaging. Anna's rages are only triggered by a specific set of circumstances, and the script creates a surprising and clever staging for each one, following on every time with a suitably gory slaughter. The film features great performances from its prestigious cast, particularly Angharad Rees who is luminously beautiful as Anna, and Eric Porter as the doctor who realises her identity but is compelled to try and cure her rather than turn her in (as well as falling for her charms, as she has no recollection of what she does when she goes into a trance). Of course, in the movies such a situation can only end in tragedy, and the climax of the story is elegantly downbeat and very effective. The period London setting, the photography and the directing all fall perfectly into place, and &quot;Hands of the Ripper&quot; can be judged as one of Hammer's greatest acheivements. It's crying out for a DVD release, so hopefully someone will take the initiative very soon. There is a UK region 2 release, but it's only available as a box set with two far inferior British 70's horror movies &quot;The Monster&quot; and &quot;The Uncanny&quot;. I was lucky and got one from a split set, but it's a real shame that most people will miss out on enjoying this movie by it not getting the circulation it deserves.

review/text: This is the best guide available. Moon travel beats the major competitor (the main travel-trail eye-sore creator) in almost all respects, but not all.Moreso than other travel guides, the Moon travel guide for Vietnam, Laos, and Cambodia has tons and tons of recent political, social and economic history in addition to significant cultural notes that a visitor *must* be aware of. (i.e., what does a South East Asian smile mean?) The maps of the cities and provinces are excellent. the all-important overland border-crossings between 'Nam, Laos, and Cambo are cleary marked. This is one of the many reasons that Moon can't be beaten at the moment. This guide's overland itineraries are the best. Example: you want to go into China overland fron northern Vietnam. How can you get up to Kunnming, China? It tells ya. And, we learn, that the one way flight into Bangkok from Kunming is the same price as the one that flys from Hanoi. (This price equality of course must be verified).The information regarding the pricing and existence of certain establishments that cater to travelers is outdated. However, where to eat or sleep has never been an important part of a book anyhow, just the general information about the area in general and how to get there is all a visitor needs. Does someone need to read a guidebook to decide specifically where to eat? Where to specifically sleep? If it does for you, do everyone a favor: stay home.The underlying story that provides the "general-informational" foundation is enough. When we come through town, understandably we don't know much, but that is far better than knowing absolutely nothing at all, which is quite common now from my conversations with tourists, and especially now among "backpackers." The purpose of why backpacking started has been lost for most.By the way, it is a fact that the communist government censors this guidebook. I found that out trying to pick it up at the post office. Well worth having.

review/text: Early on in his classic "Into Thin Air", Jon Krakauer recounts how his team leader, Rob Hall, was stung when fellow New Zealander and Everest legend Sir Edmund Hillary denounced the business of "guided climbs" on the mountain. This book tends to reinforce Hillary's point of view. The author was a client on Scott Fischer's team, one of Hall's competitors, and, as dozens of others have observed, it is primarily an exercise in shallow ego gratification, and a poorly wriiten one at that. To be fair, to simply get up Everest, even with Sherpas and guides doing most of the support work, is no mean feat; nonetheless a non-climber like myself has to wonder whether these people are really entitled to claim Everest as a trophy. Her repeated blather about being the "first Scandinavian woman" on the summit seems banal, I mean, what's next, the first gay Mexican to make the top? And her constant use of phrases like "Sagamartha, Mother Goddess of the Earth" starts to sound smarmy and condescending, heck, according to Krakauer even the Sherpas mostly refer to it simply as "Everest".The point is, these guided climbs offer a great opportunity for self-absorbed overachievers to make a name for themselves while in the process diluting the achievements of true experts. After all, if (as of 1996) some 600+ successful ascents had been logged, laymen like myself who aren't a part of the climbing fraternity might easily wonder what's so special about the whole thing. Of course, these expeditions do inject lots of badly needed cash into the Sherpas' economy, nonetheless one is inclined to wonder if the "sport" of mountaineering wouldn't be better served, as Krakauer himself suggested in passing near the end of his book, by simply banning oxygen from Everest. If nothing else, it would keep the hacks and wannabes off the hill and restore the summit to its status as a place open only to the very best climbers.

review/text: I think it would be fair to say that this book is an important work in the world of letters that emerged after World War I. The "Great War to End All Wars" was a watershed in history because as "total war" it involved the civilian population as no previous war had. And because of the many new weapons of mass destruction that were used for the first time, ten million persons died and millions of others were wounded and mutilated.Albert Camus' father, Lucien, was killed in WWI, and I think it would intuitively be realistic to think that this had a profound effect on the thoughtful youth living in straitened circumstances in Algeria. In most cases, the death of a parent will take some of the glow out of childhood. Thus, we see a man who was personally affected and wounded by WWI and a Europe in the throes of disillusionment and recovery after 1918.To many, WWI was the straw that broke the camel's back. Why didn't God prevent the war with its enormous suffering? How could a just and good God allow man to be ruined not only by poverty but also by the havoc of the war machine? Why would a civilization governed by the rational ideals that reason and goodwill could work things out fail so miserably? Was the world, and the West in particular, not shaped by the idea that responsible action governed by the moral sense would create and ever-evolving, more perfect world? And was this not all a wretched lie?Surely then, we can begin to understand how Camus and others began to believe that they were living in an absurd world, a meaningless place, where, nonetheless, one had to go on living, and by one's choices create one's life and, in concert with others, the life of social man.Thus, out of the existential crisis of the moral and economic collapse of WWI, mankind, and European-kind, would rebuild its future out of the welter of lived experience, not on preconceived principles or models provided by religion or "bourgeois morality."Thus, we see Camus' development of the absurd. In The Stranger, Camus uses the term only one time and seems to pass over it lightly giving it relatively little significance. He says, "What few people were about seemed in an absurd hurry." However, his biographer points out that the entire feeling and mood of the novel really gives us the feeling of the absurd."There is an irreducible difference between the notion and the experience of the absurd; indeed, `The Myth ofSysiphus might be said to aim at giving us this idea, and The Stranger at giving us the feeling'."How does the absurd arise? We have already suggested that WWI was the defining event for Camus and many others in bringing meaninglessness to the forefront of consciousness, but this is not to exclude many other elements."The feeling of the absurd can arise in a variety of ways, through, for example, the perception of Nature's indifference to man's values and ideals, through recognition of the finality of death, or through the shock caused by the sudden perception of the pointlessness of life's routine."Because life has become absurd, and because no eternal principles apply to direct this society, then the ultimate question becomes, "Why live?" And, if we choose to live, then we must reach some conclusion about how to live, how to move forward day-to-day."Camus is well-known for his statement that `there is only one really serious philosophical problem, that of suicide. To judge that life is or is not worth the trouble of being lived, this is to reply to the fundamental question of philosophy.'"However, Camus does not believe that suicide is the answer. He believes that man can devote himself "in a self-sacrificing manner to the welfare of his fellow man....if he does so without hope of reward and conscious that in the long run it makes no difference how he acts....it is possible to be a saint without illusion."The idea of man in the absurd is only partially revealed in The Stranger, but becomes clearer if one reads, The Myth of Sisyphus, The Rebel, and The Plague. In these works, and others,"Human pride and greatness are shown [not] in surrender...but in living in the consciousness of the absurd and yet revolting against it by man's committing himself and living in the fullest manner possible."Now, returning to the work The Stranger, we are in a position to answer a number of questions: Has Camus depicted an absurd world? Is the absurd a satisfactory alternative to the world of reason and morals that the absurd seeks to replace? Are any of the characters "living in the fullest manner possible" or on the road to becoming "saint[s] without illusion?"It is apparent that The Stranger does indeed express the feeling or mood of the absurd. The sense of meaninglessness is palpable, and the pathologies and criminal tendencies expressed in the various characters and relations among the characters are presented without any sense of judgment of their behavior. They are portrayed as though they are "just folks." Indeed, that is the height of the absurd. On the other hand, the justice system with all its preconceived judgments about Meursault, about personality, and about sin or right and wrong is portrayed as expressing just so much hot air. The absurd life for Camus is simply accepting life as it is lived whether or not those lives are or are not being lived according to our preconceived judgments about how life should be lived. Life cannot be judged. It cannot be under-stood "from the outside." Indeed, it remains obscure to those living it, but live it they must!Thus Camus draws a line in the sand. Which is real life - the lives depicted throughout the book or life seen through the prism of the moralistic magistrate, prosecutor, defense attorney, and prison chaplain? For this writer, although Camus might wish otherwise, Camus has depicted the problem, but not the solution. There is clearly a crisis of meaning in the modern world, and I would even state that I think it has reached to a deeper and more critical mass, so to speak, than when Camus was writing. We have lived through even more horrors than he, and the sense of meaninglessness, even nihilism, is more pervasive than ever. I even saw a young person with a T-shirt that read, "Whoever has the most things when he dies wins." It would be fair to say that he was proclaiming an absurd view of life.I do not see any affirmation of "saints without illusions" in this particular work, and since Camus drew a line in the sand, it is my considered view that the Algerian court system with its perceived anachronistic morals and values is actually closer to truth and "reality" than Meursault or any of his cohorts.Camus has not confounded religion with his feeble and spurious unwillingness to repent or believe. In fact, insofar as we have been given the opportunity to get to know Meursault better than the prison chaplain, we can see that Meursault is far more darkened and hardened that the chaplain might have imagined.Nor has the novel revealed that middle-class values are empty. Indeed, the bourgeois goals of the American and French revolutions to provide every citizen with a fair trial exemplifies the inherent kindness and striving for justice that marks the post-Enlightenment, democratic civilization of Western Europe, and, in a different way, the United States of America.Yes, the crisis of values truly exists. It existed in 1940, and it exists today. Far too many have rejected the middle way of Aristotle's virtuous man, the "golden mean." Far too many have rejected our institutions as based on lies, and unreal assumptions. Far too many have rejected faith in the true and living God, the redemptive power of the Cross of Christ. Yet, giving in to a tidal wave of meaninglessness is not nor ever can be the answer. The Stranger accurately suggests the parameters for understanding the absurdity of our times, but it does not even begin to suggest an answer that will transform a negative consciousness into a hopeful and happy one.

review/text: I remember having read this book in high school. I immediately fell in love with Hardy. (I was also fond of Hardy Boys at that time, so in my opinion the name Hardy acquired a special significance.) Unfortunately, though, I never liked another book by him quite so much. I've read Tess of the d'Urbvilles, Under the Greenwood Tree, Far from the Madding Crowd(which was perhaps his second best novel, as others here have affirmed), and perhaps a few others. It is strange, or perhaps significant that I remember the exact circumstance when I was reading this book. It must have been about ten in the night. I had cleared my study desk, and unlike my common practice of lying on my stomach on my bed to enjoy a book into the night, I sat down on the straight-backed chair at the desk to read it. Very soon, I was overwhelmed by the narrative of Mr. Hardy. My father came in to see what I was up to, saw the tears streaming down my face as I turned the pages of my book, and quietly went away. I have never before owned any story books- my parents told me to read out of libraries. But now I am 22, and have started earning some money of my own, and I'm going to start a little collection of my most beloved books, to pass on to my children, perhaps? And this is among my very best.

It made me feel a little bit like I was drowning, but I think it was wonderful excercise for my mind. I have so long been reading what is passing for Christian fiction that my brain had become numb. What a wonderful way to brush away the cobwebs and really dig in to something substantial. It made me uncomfortable to a degree, like something that hits just a little to close to home. Greedy, all-consuming, self-centered love at the expense of others, or worse at the expense of those you are supposed to love best. Ouch. I am a Lewis fan now and ever more.

review/text: William Golding does not leave readers with any thinking space to ponder of the values he brought up in the book. Unlike Harper Lee, whose novel requires a certain level of intelligence to interpret and understand, this novel spits out the themes directly, leaving no space for imagination. Even the symbols are so simple and uninteresting.This book has such a cynical and pessimistic view of the world, that i totally disagree with. I believe that no child would cause such destruction as this, and no child would be like he described, a incarnate of Satan.It is a book with his own thinking. It may be good if one understands and agrees with his way of thinking.I don't.

review/text: Released by DECCA as a celebratory bow for the 60th anniversary of Radu Lupu, this Schubert CD box set comprises recordings made for this label by the great Romanian pianist over more than twenty years, since his emerging on international concert platform in early 1970s. Coming with three first prizes won in prestigious international piano competitions (Van Cliburn - 1966, Enescu - 1967, Leeds - 1969) Lupu rapidly established himself as one of the top performing artists with a pronounced affinity for the classical-romantic repertoire. His refined craftsmanship seems especially suited to those lovely singing melodies and delicate moods embodied in Schubert's sonatas, impromptus, scherzos and moments musicaux. Yet Lupu hates self promotion and publicity, being widely regarded as a genuine anti-star, his arrival as one of the most acclaimed and sought-after musicians of our time has covered him by flattering engagements with most impressive concert stages and orchestras around the world.Radu Lupu's pianism has frequently been characterized as full of delicacy, exhibiting a pure romantic insight and a compelling sense of narration, kindling uneven poetic colours and masterful contrasts out of his keyboard. All that artistry - copiously flowing throughout sonatas and other pieces gathered here - is possible by simply relying on two features of Lupu's way of playing: 1) flawless technical skills engrafted onto a full-range sensitivity (mainly that crystal-clear conception and finger-work leading to his immediately recognizable touch, praised by Daniel Barenboim as "unmatched aural imagination and ability to create orchestral sonorities and textures"), and 2) an unfailing curiosity for the depths of the scores (where he finds solid arguments in order to build-up the adequate atmosphere of a certain piece, with a special care for details).Deliberately, I won't make here any nominations or comments on a particular work on these records. They were recorded at various moments in Lupu's career, on different instruments, in different halls, with - evidently - different soul dispositions, but each of them seems to convey something very deep and unique. As a whole, all these renditions (along with that wonderful CD devoted exclusively to Impromptus and not included in this compilation) offer a faithful image of the evolution of this special pianist's approach to Schubert repertoire.I honestly do consider this CD box set as a must for all who love Schubert piano music and are interested in fine accounts of it. Radu Lupu's are among the very few authentic and valuable ones on the market now. In my own collection it secured for itself a first rank place, a kind of crown pearl among other sparkling jewels. And that is not only for Lupu has - temporarily, I hope - retired from recording studios, but also for the intense and natural musicianship these records breathe. Don't miss this marvel at an affordable price.

review/text: Ok. I wanted to learn about these techniques because frankly, mind control fascinates (and scares) me. But this book is just HORRIBLE. It is loaded with cryptic, needlessly esoteric psychobabble and complex metaphors as well as thousands of random historical facts about MI6, the CIA, the FBI, Joseph Mengele, African tribesmen, etc all strung together randomly and using no particular time line. He jumps around so much that you wonder if he himself has multiple personalities or wrote this entire book stream-of-consciousness. I am being completely serious! In the very beginning of the book, he defines several mind control terms that will be used throughout each chapter (such as "alter"), but this really does not help the reader along much because the problem is his writing style, which consists mainly of run-on sentences and extremely long-winded paragraphs that make no cognitive sense initially. This book was CLEARLY not edited by a professional. At times it is so densely packed with information that you literally have to read a single sentence 6 or 7 times to infer its meaning. Below is an example of what I am talking about. This is only a PORTION of a single paragraph (not the entire paragraph, which goes on for almost an entire page without a break):"In Illuminati systems these early parts are dehumanized into thinkingthey are gems and crystals. These gems and crystals then "power" theentire mind-control system that is programmed over the following yearsinto the child's mind. The gems are not perceived as alters, so the proxycore wouldn't integrate with what is perceived as an inanimate object.The proxy core is allowed to want to move toward health with a therapist,it is programmed to move toward healing, but to lead the therapist awayfrom the true core. She or he is programmed to believe it is the truecore. The real core & its first splits, which are the gems, are placedhypnotically at the mind's deepest levels--in an area of the mind fewtherapists ever search."How could anyone possibly understand this without some kind of "decoder ring"? This is actually one of the more *simplistic* sections of the book! The whole thing reads like a technical manual. I just don't see the point of being so cryptic if your purpose is to educate people. I honestly don't think I would recommend this book to anyone. Ever.

Frankly, I am not sure what is different in this one that than the last one (2nd). I will state: I never watched the cartoon; I really enjoyed the first movie. The story had a pretty good setup, but by the end I didn't care and just wanted the movie to be over.The video quality on the disc is top-notch and the 7.1 sound was terrific on my 120" scope/ 7.1 system. I always like to see the subtitles in the picture (due to my constant in height setup). I heard great directionality. I saw no artifacts or any video problems. Could easily be a demo disc for sound and audio.As far as extras, this disc has none (probably why the video looks so good from a compression standpoint). I can't seem to find time to watch all of the movies I want to, much less the extras.I will be very wary before I spend more money on this franchise in the future.

review/text: During my lifetime, I have always enjoyed playing video games and watching tv. I was a true couch potatoe, and barely left to go play with my friends. And the thing I hated most was reading. Any book, no matter how interesting, could't keep my attention, and didn't keep me reading. Language Arts was my least favorite class, becuase reading was so boaring at the time. When I moved to California ,I made a new friend named Tina. We both shared the intrest in video games, but she loved to read. Eventually, she told me about this book. I told her I loved cats, and read the prelouge. At first, I nodded it off, telling her that I'm not really into reading. But the next time I went over thier, I looked at the book again. It was like pulling me into it. It was the only book that caught my intrest. I kept reading, and pretty soon, it was the best book ever. It could make someone like Tina that hated cats before, love them. She even got 2 of them becuase of the books! When I was finished that book, my life changed. I started reading the rest of the series, and read the ones I've already read. When you read them, its like you're in another world. I, the one who hated books and never picked on up in my life, actually cried, laughed, and yelled positive and negative things about the characters in the book, like I was actually their. My language arts grade went up when I became one of the quickest and most observant readers in the class, and I even looked at my greenbelt, aware of the freedom it brings. This brought me outside, playing sports, and running around with friends. Every person that I suggest these books to read the first chapter, and can't stop! I assure you you will be satisfied, and even more! I read all kinds of books now, but nothing compares to the excitment, the saddness, and the love in Warriors: Into the Wild.BTW, I'm 13, so for all parents out their, my mother loves the books too. They're great for children, and their fall in love with the cats. But it's also great for teens and adults.

review/text: Those familiar with Laurie Sheck's three other books will find her latest to be an impressive expansion on her vivid imagery drawn from urban or ancient settings as she now ventures into the black of the Nevada Test Site, among other places. Anyone who has visited the haunting Mercury, Nevada cannot fail to be captivated by Laurie's poem Traces. We who read The Store Windows Glitter in the Boston Review last year and were gasping for more will not be disappointed, as she continues with The Mannequins to explore and contrast the living and the inanimate.Laurie has once again crystallized the meaning of urban life in The Subway Platform, which is in some ways a poetic parallel to Cristina Peri Rossi's The Crack in The Museum of Useless Efforts, though Laurie's poem is more personal and intense.Readers who enjoyed Laurie's previous works on ancient subjects will find much to enchant here, such as Medusa and Pompeii. It is this contrast between the past and contemporary worlds that makes these poems a compelling read. Cave paintings compared with urban grafitti (in separate poems) are but one example of the startling imagery that permeates this book.Another aspect of these poems that elevates them above much of today's poetry is their sense of the impact of computers and technology on our lives. In reading most poets writing today, one would never know that computers or advanced technology exist at all, as these dominant aspects of life are largely ignored. Laurie's poem Circuits is but one illustration of how this book responds to our electronic environment and makes a literary statement that any reader can appreciate.Note: The title of this review is a variant on the title of Moynihan's Maximum Feasible Misunderstanding. The misunderstanding here concerns a rather pathetic review of Black Series that appeared in the New York Times in which the critic displayed a complete ignorance of what Laurie's poetry is. Without belaboring the point, that reviewer felt that Black Series needs more &quot;precision,&quot; a charge so ridiculous that it reminds me of a critic of Emily Dickinson's &quot;I taste a liquor never brewed/From tankards scooped in pearl&quot; who disliked the poem because he believed pearl to be an inadequate material for making a beverage container. That's about as much sense as the NYT review makes, so ignore it.Black Series is a book to buy and enjoy through multiple readings. The subject matter is astonishingly diverse, and the poems are much more intense than most being written today. This book is a feast for the reader.

review/text: This is the assured second short story collection by the terrific Kentucky writer Crystal Wilkinson. This author has met the challenge of voice - the people of Water Street sound just like themselves. Their speech and their inner dialogue ease into the reader's head and heart, and stick there.Reasons to read this book:1. The dialogue. As a white person, I felt privileged to read the generous language of black culture, which this African American author uses with verve. Ms. Wilkinson lets me and readers like me in on the secrets of another culture and language, and it's exciting.2. The drama between outer and inner lives. The author's skilled hand paints the particular customs and habits of the interwoven outer lives of the people of Water Street at the same time she reveals to readers the particular secrets, griefs, traumas, and hopes of these compelling characters. The result is fresh, a combination of solid description of what anyone could see by looking and juicy surprises that lie beneath the mostly benificent surfaces of both people and place.3. The complex, believable men. The author paints women with accuracy and insight - but we expect this of an accomplished woman writer. The bonus here is the men. The men in this book are like most men you and I know. They aren't voracious womanizers; they aren't child abandoners; they are humans. They think about their lives, they want to do well, they make mistakes, they work, grieve, and try to fix problems. Ms. Wilkinson's male characters live multi-dimensional lives, and she takes us straight into their ways of seeing their actions, mistakes, and hopes. This is healthy and so unlike the stereotyped, lightly sketched male types that fill much contemporary literature (and the news) that it is reason enough to read this book.4. The authenticity of the few individual relationships between white and black characters. This book presents an honest picture of the "outliers" in both races who try, at times, to vault over race-based barriers to be humans together. We should put this book in a time capsule from 2002; it shows us as we are right now, after outright racial segregation has been illegal for decades, but before black and white Americans have made the changes we must make to live equitably and easily together, with mutual respect and appreciation.5. The universality of the characters' lives, problems, and experiences. Like all good tales, these particular stories of mostly African American people on Water Street in a small Kentucky town tell us much about our own humanity, no matter how different we think we are from the characters. The stories reassure us, challenge us, and, thanks to the author's great gift for gentle revelation, teach us who we are and who we can become.

review/text: I kept reading this book because on some level I was just waiting for something to happen. There were a couple of conflicts that could come to head somehow and make the book interesting in the "I'm reading a fictional narrative sort of way". However, none of these became more than hints until the very last two pages of the book. When this happens it seems like some predetermined anticlimax that you have been waiting for all along. The book fails as a narrative which is a problem when the publishers want to sell it as fiction.The problem is that it is not a work of fiction but is more a work of philosophy as story. I kept thinking ofCandideorGulliver's Travels (Oxford World's Classics). The problem is that Voltaire and Swift's works were at the bottom much more interestingly told. Island is the vehicle for Huxley to lay out his real utopia devised after a lifetime of intellectual work. The protagonist and the reader are guided around the island to learn about the pro-Buddhist, pro-hallucinatory drug, pro-sex, and anti(capitalist, communist, consumption, western education, nuclear family, etc) philosophy.This journey, as the protagonist learns and starts to internalize the teachings of the island, comes to an end based on the forces that represent the bad in the world. Poor Huxley's utopia even though isolated from the world cannot survive as the very nature of the philosophy is non-violent and acquiescent. It contains the seeds of its own destruction. I cannot help but think how much Huxley hated modernity and hoped for and sought a world beyond this one in the form of religion and drugs. For him, the struggle was not about the control of the means of production, but whether the means of production should exist. I just think he should thank his stars that he did not live to see the Brave New World in the flower as we can see it.

review/text: Reading through the other reviews posted here, I can't believe some of the things I'm seeing! To the reviewer who thought it 'bland' because he listened to a friends copy whilst at work.... do you really think 1 listen is enough to warrant a review? Or any of the reviewers for that matter?This album is a brilliant album. It's different enough from Wiretap Scars, whilst still remaining close to their roots. If you have a winning formula, why change it? The band have moved on well in my opinion. The material is fresh and a natural progression from Wiretap.The main difference that I have found so far in how the albums have grasped me, is that Wiretap grabbed me immediately, whereas the songs on Porcelain seem to have more of a 'growing on you' effect. This is not to say they aren't jsut as good if not better as the Wiretap tracks, just how it happened for me!As for the actual music, I think it's an extremely solid production, I don't find myself hitting the skip button at all when listening. Each track can stand on its own as a good track. The absolute standouts for me are Tensioning and Splinters. What amazes me about sparta is the way in which, upon repeat listens, one can pick out subtle new riffs and elements to songs not heard previously. Each track has managed to get stuck in my head at different points since i bought it, which is pretty rare! I own upwards of 150 album, and Porcelain is definately, even after only 1 month of owning it, one of my best buys ever.If there is one gripe I have with this album, and it is SLIGHT, but it is that 'From Now to Never' (brilliant track!) should end at about 5 minutes, but instead launches into a weird 3 minute slow piano driven fadeout including random french speaking, it just seems a little out of place, and disrupts the flow a little. But again, this gripe is minor. A STRONGLY recommended album for all.

review/text: The video of the DVD version is absolutely beautiful, especially through component outputs, and the Dolby 5.1 sound is awesome. But the video and audio, particulary dialogue, were sometimes jarringly out-of-sync. I've seen the VHS version several times and never noticed this problem, so it's apparently unique to the DVD version. Unfortunately, it's a critical flaw in an otherwise perfect DVD.

review/text: Like another reviewer of Facing the Extreme, I had just read Krakauer's Into Thin Air and had to read more on mountain climbing. I choose Facing because of the title and because it was about one of &quot;The Seven Summits&quot;.Kocour portrays herself as an accomplished mountianeer, but imho her writing is far from accomplished.I wished the book had included a good map so I could follow the progress of the group up the mounain. I also needed a Dramatis Personae. (I finally wrote-up my own.)I was annoyed as Ms. Kocour's words revealed her over-idealization of the guides and her general contempt for the other climbers (except for her tent-mate). (It would be nice to read a book about the climb written by one of the others; I wonder how they saw her.)Her writing imho is juvenile and, especially disconcerting, are the numerous (unintended, I assume) puns.Still, I'm glad her friends et al encouraged her to write the book and overall I'm glad I read it. I know more about climbing than I did and more about Denali aka Mt. McKinley.Before her next book, and I hope she writes again about her climbs, I hope she will enroll in a good basic writing class; one in which she will Face an Extreme(ly) rigorous teacher!

Then read it only when it's one of those days where you just can't find anything else to read.She claimed to have been a mountain climber before Everest, but yet she had to ask other people what she needed to purchase for that climb. I would think that a &quot;Mountain Climber&quot; would have known what to purchase as far as equipment needed.She talks of this Zen responsibility then turns around to inform the readers of how Sandy Pittman is having an affair going on in her tent, of how Anatoli Boukreev's girlfriend &quot;tip-toes&quot; each afternoon to his tent to spend the night with him. I then ask myself, I wonder whose tent she was &quot;tip-toeing&quot; to, with the &quot;sexy green underware&quot; she speaks of in her book. Hmm?The book has nothing to do with Mountain Climbing if that is what you are interested in.

The real problem with this movie isn't the crude humor, but the songs.I personally hate movies that just break out into songs every few minutes, and this is one of them. Basically I am assuming you can visit any other review for the synopsis, but if you hate songs then don't get this. About 25 minutes of it mabye is songs, just to let you know.

review/text: Okay, so she's no Meryl Streep but Madonna is not a bad actress! This film proves it. She does a fine job as does the rest of the cast. But, she isn't the centerpiece of the movie, so I really don't see why all the slings and arrows from critics are about her acting. The movie does a good job provoking thought about the issues it explores: what is the definition of a &quot;family&quot; in our society today, should a convention family be the mold we all follow, should a gay man have as much parental rights as a straight man etc. There's a good blend of comedy and drama. The movie is no &quot;Titanic&quot; but it's still good entertainment, a nice diversion. Fun in the beginning, sad towards the climax, touching by the end. Immitates real life quite a bit. It should fare much better on video.

review/text: The most damning information that Goni found was that the Vatican had no qualms about helping "good, honest, catholics" from escaping their fates in Europe for what the did during WW2. Hundreds (maybe thousands) of SS and those who ran the 'concentration camp' system were smuggled out through Italy and Spain with the connivance of the Church and the IRC (International Red Cross). Everyone turned a blind eye to those men (like Mengele and Eichman) who used phony names on passport applications that were signed by 'fellow travelers'.In many cases Argentina would allow five or six jews to immigrate on a ship that carried SS Officers and their families so as to look magnanimous. What's worse is that Pope Pius XII, who never made public statements about the plight of the Jews before and during the war, was complicit in giving protection and succor to the perpetrators of the 'worst genocide' ever committed. In fact, none of those who were later condemned at Nuremburg or escaped, were ever ex-communicated.Monsignor Montini (who was later to be elevated as Paul VI) acted as co- Secretary of State for Pius during this time and met regularly with the groups in the Vatican who were working to help SS and others to emigrate to Argentina. Unfortunately, the Vatican still refuses to open up the Archives from Pope Pius XII and allow scholars to review documentation of correspondence between the Holy See and Buenos Aires during this time.Though many of the Argentine archives relating to those who were smuggled out of Europe were destroyed in 1996, enough is left over in other places that show who help develop the 'ratlines' that allowed these murderers to escape prosecution for their deeds. Sadly in many cases both the governments of the US and UK assisted in helping these people hide in the hope of fomenting unrest back behind the 'Iron Curtain' or using their scientific knowledge.Zeb Kantrowitz

review/text: The film of &quot;Funny Girl&quot; was awaited with much anticipation after all the tremendous publicity given to Barbra Streisand following her stunning portrayal of Fanny Brice in the hit Broadway show. Streisand won the Best Actress Oscar for her role in the film (but had to share the award with Katharine Hepburn).The young Fanny Brice (Barbra Streisand) desperately wants to be a success in show business and after a shaky start thinks she has made it when she lands a part in a big Ziegfeld show. Ziegfeld (Walter Pidgeon) and Fanny clash over various matters connected with the show due to her strong personality but her talent shines through and she eventually becomes a major star. She meets gambler Nicky Arnstein (Omar Sharif) and falls madly in love with him. Unfortunately, his gambling habits get him in trouble with the police causing Fanny much sadness and anguish. However, she manages to overcome these problems to concentrate on her career and becomes a big Broadway star.The film was directed by the legendary William Wyler and produced by Ray Stark (who was in fact Fanny Brice's son-in-law!). The film had a superior supporting cast including Kay Medford (repeating her Broadway role as Rose Brice), Anne Francis (Georgia James), Lee Allen (Eddie Ryan), Gerald Mohr (Branca), and Frank Faylen as Keeney.Some favourite lines from the film:Barbra Streisand (to her reflection in theatre mirror): &quot;Hello, gorgeous&quot;.Lee Allen (to Streisand): &quot;Are you sure you can rollerskate?&quot;. Streisand: &quot;Can I rollerskate?&quot;.Streisand (to Walter Pidgeon): &quot;O.K. you win. You don't win fair but you win!&quot;.Due to the success of &quot;Funny Girl&quot; a sequel was made (in 1975) called &quot;Funny Lady&quot; with Streisand again and James Caan as Billy Rose. Omar Sharif also returned in a cameo role but the sequel was not as popular as the original. &quot;Funny Girl&quot; was one of those rare occasions when the perfect part came along with the perfect actress to play it. One of the last of the great Hollywood musicals. Clive Roberts.

review/text: Hailed by many as M&aacute;rquez's finest literary work, One Hundred Years of Solitude tells the story of the Buend&iacute;a family, who live and work in the South American jungle. M&aacute;rquez unites great wit and comic timing with philosophy to produce the extraordinary book, and the combination of fantasy, magic and reality makes for enthralling reading.Laughter and tragedy, love and death are all bound together by Garcia's unique writing style. There is exploration and adventure, but always with a slight tinge of sadness and nostalgia. M&aacute;rquez brings you into the Buend&iacute;a family and lets you experience their joys and triumphs, failures and disappointments at first hand. You experience life through their eyes, and become intimately acquainted with their fears, hopes and dreams.In 1982 M&aacute;rquez was awarded the Nobel Prize for Literature, and his other works include Love in the time of the Cholera and Of Love and Other Demons, as well as several short story collections. In all his books he invokes real emotion from the reader, and One Hundred Years of Solitude is no different. Whilst reading this book you are sent into an almost trance-like state, and become completely enveloped in the story. Fantasy and reality are intertwined so closely that it becomes impossible to tell the difference. M&aacute;rquez also explores the notion of time, as the later generations in Macondo repeat the experiences of the first generations. The names people receive are also relevant-for example all 17 Aurelianos are articulate, solitary men, and all Jose Arcadios are enterprising and energetic.This is a challenging read-I found myself turning to the front page to look at the family tree many times. However, this is an excellent book, destined to become a classic. An unmissable read, by perhaps the greatest author of our times.

review/text: But i can't give it more than 3 stars. Why? first, as the reviewer below states, Peter Kingsley throws out an awful lot of assumptions without any backup. No guided footnotes, no back story, just a jumble at the back of the book for people to sift through. Combined with his sensationalist style a-la The Davinci Code (not sure which came first), it's awful and insulting. Perhaps because of this style, he ends up wasting our time as he thinks things through for himself in parts without just giving us the information to think through ourselves - as if we're incapable of doing so...i really wonder how he can be a university professor since he talks to us like we're in high school. He does this while also telling us how great it is that the ancient Greeks did no such thing - they wrote simply but with deep meaning, and let the reader figure it out (i guess he's not as clever as they were? or does he think we aren't?) Oh, right -- throughout the book he explains that scholars are stupid and only he and a few others really understand how to explain what's going on! Yes, that's why!But even with all that, i was getting into this book in spite of myself, as he brought out a lot of interesting facts about the Phocaeans and Parmeneides. But when he literally pulled this one out of his a**--he said that some scholars actually believe the harmony of the spheres heard by Pythagoras was the sound of a snake hiss--i had to just laugh. Now, it's true that a large portion of people don't actually hear overtones, but there are many of us who do - and you don't mistake the sound for a hissing snake. Furthermore, to say such a thing totally dismisses all of Pythagoras's teachings about harmony and the overtone series, which wouldn't exist if all that were the case. But saying they sounded like "pipes" as Parmeneides and Pythagoras in fact did would be a better bet. I guess Peter likes to take what those dumb scholars said if they fit his own agenda. Indeed, Peter Kingsley apparently dismisses the actual word for pipes USED by the ancients, to bring hissing snakes into his theories. To twist something so simple around like that just made me lose respect for him. Sorry Peter. I wanted to like you because it's obvious you're a great student of this stuff, but you owe us a little more than that.In the end, what we learn that is so important is actually nothing new - that the great philosophers, mathematicians, etc. in ancient Greece were mystics, and that Plato shut the door on that. Well, that has been an acknowleged fact for a long long time. The sad thing is, that this book has some interesting information about the mysticism practiced. But it's couched in paragraphs and paragraphs of an angry tone about how there's a conspiracy (yes he uses that word) to keep people from knowing it. Too bad - but i guess it's because, if you take all the unnecessary stuff out, it would've been a much thinner book.

review/text: What "improvements" have been made for the Bantam edition? There are already major differences in punctuation, word choices, and scene breaks between the original Collins (TAKEN AT THE FLOOD) and Dodd Mead (THERE IS A TIDE) editions of this novel. There are further differences between the Dodd Mead editions republished by Random House/Avenel and the Dodd Mead editions republished by Simon & Shuster/Pocket. There are further additions still in the Signet, Berkley, and Black Dog & Leventhal editions. For every publishing house putting out her works, there seem to be a new batch of editors altering Agatha Christie's words and the sound of her voice. What's the matter with these publishers? Whose voice do they think we want to hear when we sit down to a novel by Agatha Christie? And what will she sound like twenty years from now? It's frightening that her estate has failed to see the importance of guarding her words as she wrote them. Please tell me I'm not the only one here who senses that a crime has been committed.

review/text: I have been surprised just how little CS Lewis bases his theology on the Bible. He has some interesting ideas, but often writes things that are confusing or just plain untrue. He writes as though evolution is a substantiated fact, but really it is just people's ideas and it contradicts the Bible. He bases a lot of his ideas about our behavior on what seems like a good idea, with no reference to the Bible. He doesn't give the impression that he was very familiar with the Bible. He appears to have been heavily influenced by human philosophies and tries to incorporate them into a religious framework.

review/text: Although the reason I did not like the Hi-tech altitude IVs are subjective, I will at least explain why i didn't like them.First off, there are a bit big and bulky. No so much heavy as just get in your way. I didn't feel like I could have very good freedom of movement in them.they were comfortable, and felt good in terms of cushioning the sole of my foot. it's not so much soft as much as it is slightly sloped on the medial and lateral sides of the heel the form more of a cradle for the posterior of the foot. most of this cradling is provided by the inserted sockliner.three things I was especially disappointed with were the heel height (very high, felt like you were wearing a cowboy boot), stiff forefoot toe-up bend that made walking feel more like rocking on a semicircle plate rather that the shoe actually flexing and an unnatural overlay under the left big toe beneath the sockliner.When i think about it, it does walk and resemble a cowboy boot sole form (not tread but actual sole plate shape) and heel height. comparing them to a walking shoe, sport shoe or even a timberland boot which i compared to these, the forefoot did have much more "rock" to it, which i thought felt weird. for instance, the timberland boots' toe lays flat on the ground. in this shoe, the toe will be slightly elevated off the ground. and the toe box is not very flexible to allow for the more common flattening.The unnatural and bulge under the toe could not have been normal. likely a factory defect of some type that passed unnoticed through quality control. it was not only distracting (i have a pet peeve about symmetry- each side should feel the same and equally balanced) but it was painful after a few minutes of walking if you push off your toes at all.from above, i thought the shoe was ugly, which is important to me because that is the part of the shoe you, the wearer, see most. the leather shows markings easily. and i thought the top around the ankle fit either too loose or too tight, depending on how you lace it.I do not know about it's waterproofing ability; I did not wear it in wet conditions. insulation to cold is average to below average. it felt about 1/2 size too small.if you are looking for a design like this, with a higher rise and similar stying, it was fairly comfortable. I do not believe the overlay bulge under the toe would be a problem with other shoes of this make and model, just an isolated incident.Amazon shipping was fast and excellent. i enrolled in Amazon Prime free because I am a college student and got 1-day shipping for $3.99. great deal.just didn't like them. not for me. in the process of returning them now. hope this helps.

The theological movie brings action,love and a little sci-fi to the table with the classic good vs. evil genre. Keanu Reeves plays John Constatine a chronicaly depressed over smoker. John who wish is to go to heaven but after attepted scuicde he already to late. So he trys to buy his way into heaven by sending excorcized demons back to hell. After a brief talk with the angel Gabrielle he finds that this wouldn't work so he goes deeper into dispare. Along the way he meets a cop who twin sister has commited suicide played by Rachel Weize. As she follows him through all the madness of his work she soon finds that guns will not get rid of evil but only faith can. As the plot thickens johns preiest freind dies by the hands of a demon half-breed and john grows ever wearry of his task. The movie action and special effects are awesome. Near the end john must sacrifice himself to save weize and its then when lucifer comes to collect his soul but as the scriptures say slef sacrifice earns you into heaven but lucifer will not let this happen so he keeps john on earth by removing the cancer that was ticcking john closer to death. In my opinion this was the best movie of the year and Im sorry if the die-hard fans of hellraiser didnt like the movie but get over it some things need change to be better. All in all i wish they would have a ten star system but even then i would try 11.

review/text: This is my fourth ISE Hot Water Dispenser. The first three lasted anywhere from 2 - 4 years each, before the tanks started leaking and the units had to be replaced. In addition to the tank problem the first two units had failures with an internal thermal switch. It's about a $15 part that was fairly easy to replace if you are somewhat handy with tools and are not afraid of working with electrical components. On my third unit, the hot water tank was redesigned to include a different type thermal switch that was re-settable, like a circuit breaker. That successfully eliminated the thermal switch problem. It seems that the design of the tank for this appliance is continuously evolving. My first unit had a copper tank, the next two had plastic tanks, which I hated, and now this one has a larger (2/3 gallon) stainless steel tank. Seems like a move in the right direction. Installation was easy. I've set the external thermostat (a nice addition) to 190 degrees and it heats the water to that temperature without any spatter. I've verified the water temperature with a digital thermometer. On the previous units I would get spatter at 180 degrees. Since I've only had this unit for a month, I can't predict if it's going to be more reliable then the previous collection I had, but so far it has performed flawlessly. I would like to add that even with the problems that I have experienced with the ISE hot water dispensers, for me it is a very useful appliance, and one that I do not hesitate replacing when it gets to a point where repair is simply not an option.

review/text: Kids has gained notoriety since its 1995 release for its controversial view on the life of kids today. Some of the subjects that this movie covers are very real, indeed. Praise should also be given to the casting director for this movie, Alysa Wishingrad, who was able to choose actors who looked very real and actually appeared to fit the part that they were chosen for--the role of kids.However real they may have looked, there is just something about the performance of Leo Fitzpatrick as Telly that doesn't work. He seemed to fit into the role far too well, and at times it seems that he is overacting the part as a cocky sex fiend. For this reviewer, Telly just grated on the nerves after a few minutes.Praise should be given to the late Justin Pierce in his role as Casper, as he no doubt was created to be a very likeable character, and he succeeded with flying colors. In this movie, he appears to be the most realistic male kid on the cast, as many young teenagers could likely identify with the personality that Casper conveys.As far as the females go, it should first be noted that Kids was the first role for both Rosario Dawson and Chlo Sevigny, who played the roles of Ruby and Jennie, respectively. Sevigny's performance was stellar, as her emotions felt real, her plight was understandable. She was given all the sympathy in this film, and she earned it with excellent dramatic acting.Unfortunately, the performances of Pierce and Sevigny are outweighed by Telly, who overexaggerates his role and ultimately ruins the movie. By the end of the film, however, things will have picked up, and the climax thankfully delivers a disturbing, yet satisfying ending.The sad truth is that this movie is merely kids play (pardon the pun) compared to the things that kids are getting involved in today. Still, the events that these kids go through seem very real, and they are very real. All in all, Kids is a movie that should be seen only once or twice, to understand the controversy that this movie has rightfully garnered with its headon attack at kids' issues.

There's Felicia, a somewhat plain teenage girl from a depressed industrial town in the Irish Republic. She's the product of a convent school, but only on suffrance because her father tends the convent's gardens. She's inexperienced and naive and when Johnny Lysaght comes along and turns her head, her subsequent pregnancy is no surprise. And there's Mr. Hilditch, a fifty-something catering manager at a factory in the English Midlands, who lives by himself and fancies young girls, though he's very careful &quot;not to shop near home,&quot; as he thinks of it. Felicia runs away from home in search of the absent Johnny, but she finds it's not easy even to survive, much less to locate an errant Irishman, in England. She's a bit suspicious of Hilditch when he tries to help her out, but he arranges things to reduce her options, and Felicia is suddenly in very great danger indeed. Trevor does a terrific job getting inside the head of a pleasant, mild-mannered psychopath, allowing the reader to gradually understand what makes him tick. He won the Whitbread Prize (again) for this novel and he deserved it.

review/text: I enjoyed this book, spending the better part of a Sunday afternoon to finish it. It is the beginning of a series focused on bright and personable young Chuck O'Malley. The young man has the gift for detective work that is a common trait of Greeley's protagonists. While the setting and character types are familiar from other Greeley novels, the story is a pleasant exploration of familiar territory. This story provided a nice balance of action, suspense, and good characters. It's frustration is that it is the first installment in a series and just when you want more the book ends. Of course, the next installment is available as I write this belated review. Chuck O'Malley may just end up on my favorite character list along with Blackie Ryan and the Coynes (Dermot and Naula Ann).

review/text: If you've yet to read this masterpiece, hurry. When you get tired of reading or think that what Orwell writes is unrealistically drab, then flip on CNN and catch your daily dose of propaganda. The world of 1984 is modern America, bin Laden is Goldstein and the book is terrifying. John Ashcroft on 1.29.02 ordered a semi-nude statue of Justice in the Justice Department to be covered by a sheet (check the nydailynews.com archive - No Nudes Good News at Justice). 1984 depicts a world in which the populace suffers but suffers because a war is being waged, a war against faceless terrorists whose existence is only proved by the occasional bombing and "telescreen" broadcasts of the Brotherhood's evil leader Goldstein. Life in Airstrip One (UK) is a miserable existence with barely enough food, many people going without shoes, no art, no free speech and cheap, rotgut alcohol. Give the recession and the Bush administration a few more years in their 'war against terrorism' and see if you can even still find this book outside of illegal personal collections.After you're done with 1984 check out "Homage to Catalonia" Orwell's account of his time spent in the Spanish Civil War on the side of the Communists and Anarchists (which means believing in no central government by the way, the way the Native Americans, Druids and numerous other peoples lived, not all out savagery like the American thought police would have you believe) versus the Fascists. Homage to Catalonia will help you have a better understanding of what WWII was all about, how the advent of technology set the stage for the top nations in the world to battle of raw materials, slave laborers and market share. Do some research and see that nearly all of Europe was Socialist or full on Communists at the time of WWII and then realize that American Fascism and Soviet Communism (really Soviet Fascism) defeated Nazi Fascism and that the Cold War was necessary for American Corporations to grow and take over the world with every country that didn't want to be bent over by the US Corps. being invaded outright or overthrown by American backed troops for being Marxists. The collapse of Soviet Russia was disatrous for America because no bad guy meant we had to pay back debts and answer for the daily suffering of millions of Americans. Enter the evil camel jockeys and the questions of fairness for the common man are again put on the back burner.

review/text: Hi all,I just got my squeem in the mail today and I'm super excited! Im wearing it now! I'm 5'6 and overweight (not obese), gained a lot of weight from a medical condition so I thought this product would be perfect for me.I'm really impressed by how long it is. It goes from under your boobs (and thus, over your back-fat) right down to your crouch. It makes me feel taller because you have to maintain good posture while you wear it. I'm really excited about that. I've been wearing it for a few hours now, normally my back would be hurting by now - BUT IT ISN'T! The heat is amazing. I think it will also be great for menstrual cramps.I wear a 32 inche in jeans, but I ordered the large instead of the medium. With the large, I had a hard time putting it on. I had to have someone else hold it together so I could hook it in.I wore it while eating lunch today and it was great! It didn't make my appetite leave, but when I was full - that was it! No more eating!I haven't taken it off as yet and I'm excited to see how what my results will be. It's really comfortable, I feel like I'll have no problem wearing it to work and school and maybe even while sleeping. At first, it was hard to breathe for a few minutes, but it was much better after I adjusted. It has given my mid-section a beautiful hour-shape look to it.I'm so excited to see results!!!!The only downfall to this product so far is the price. I paid $68 with shipping and handling (Canada).If you can't afford it, ask people who care about you pitch in to help you pay for it, because its worth it. Not just for the aesthetic value (makes your tummy smaller) but the heat and posture aspect of it. I have lower back pain, from a car accident and normally I cannot sit for very long. But I have been with this thing on.If the money is too much - try to buy a used one. I saw a used one on this website for $29. I think I'll do that when it comes down to get a smaller size.Good luck ladies!!

review/text: "Motor City Moments" is Regina Carter's 4th CD and it is amazing to listen to. It opens with an uptempo, improvisational-like, number, "Don't Git Sassy" then settles into a contemplative, salsa tune "For Somoeone I Love," where Carter plucks her violin then make it laugh, weep and glide all in one song. I haven't heard the Milt Jackson version, but it would be interesting to hear the original to see how this interpretation is different. There also some interesting selections like "The Love Theme from Spartacus." Carter's lamenteous violin is softly accompanied by Marcus Belgrave's flugelhorn. In some instances, the two instruments merge into one sound. But the ultimate gem in this CD is Carter's version of Chattanooga Choo Choo. It should be a standard violin piece much like Mozart's Sonatas. It sounds like it was written for the violin and Carter is in absolute command here, with such fire and fluidity, I'm definetly impress! One should buy this CD just for this number alone.

Visually it is very beautiful and it looks like the same animators who did The Hobit. The story is okay and the acting is bearable, but the music is awful!!! This overextended depressing 80s music really ruins it. The best way to enjoy this film is on a poster.

review/text: This book was a big disappointment. I became a huge fan of Sedaris' work after reading "Naked" and "Me Talk Pretty One Day." Both those books were hilarious and, sometimes, even touching. After thoroughly enjoying his prior work, I anxiously awaited his next. Unfortunately, "Dress Your Family" does not even come close to the standard set by his earlier books.In this book, instead coming across as the witty, insightful goof that often says what most of us wish we could 1) actually think of to say; and 2) have the nerve to say, he now comes across as just negative, petty, and bitter. Unlike his prior books, I did not find myself agreeing with Sedaris' insights, but instead feeling more like I just wanted to shake him and tell him to stop being negative and such a jerk. In his earlier books Sedaris came across as a man who loves his family but is able to point out there various quirks. In this book, he is so negative about everything regarding his family, it really does not appear he likes them very much and that they do not like him.Moreover, whereas Sedaris previous gave us humorous insights into his family -- to such a degree the reader could actually feel as though he was a part of Sedaris' family or at least that he likes Sedaris' family -- in "Dress Your Family" Sedaris' focus on the negative becomes just depressing and provides none of the warm, fuzzy feelings about his family. When Sedaris writes about his mother's dying, his sister-in-law's inability to have additional children, his sister's inability to hold a job, the reader does not laugh along with his family, but instead just gets bummed out.A couple of the stories in the book are still quite funny -- "Six to Eight Black Men" for example -- but as a whole, the book was not funny. I did actually laugh out loud several times while reading "Naked" and "Me Talk Pretty." Such was not the case with "Dress Your Family." Perhaps Sedaris has already used up all his amusing life stories in his earlier works and all that are left are the downers.My advice, read his earlier work. THAT work you will enjoy. I doubt you will enjoy this book.

review/text: I'm still not to sure what possessed me to read this. Sure a bunch of people I knew said it was great. Now I'm seriously questioning their sanity. For some reason I kept reading, as I hoped it would get better. 600+ pages later, I've realized that I'm never going to get that time back. The author manages to reduce the Tudor Era into a cheesy soap opera. Seriously, one could have just replaced the names with modern day ones, and set the story in some inner city, and made it about drug dealers and prostitutes, and it would have more or less read the same.First off, the main character. Besides Bella in Twilight, I'd find it difficult to find a more bland and boring main character. Her sum goal in life seems to be, I want to marry for love! and have lots of bouncing babies! The author glorifies this, by contrasting her to her nymphomaniac of a sister, Anne, who's depicted as cruel and comes off as an insane harpy. Now, the author considers her self a feminist, yet she portrays the active woman as a monster, and the "good" woman, as passive and bland. Oh, and if its not subtle enough, Anne has dark hair, and dark features, while the good sister, has blond hair and pale features. Coincidence? I think not.Now, on to the history of this book. For some reason the author decided that all allegations made against Anne were true. This is the historical equivalent of saying that all the allegations made during the communist show trials of the 50's were true. The author takes this to the extreme, and in her book, Anne sleeps with her own brother in an attempt to get pregnant. At the end, the whole thing just comes off as offensive.The writing is pretty bad also. The heavy use of foreshadowing doesn't help the situation. I'm pretty sure people already know what happened to Anne, so they aren't going to be saying when they reach the end of the book "Darn...I should have seen that coming!"In short, save your money, save your time and read some good historical fiction. Like Susanne Alleyn's A Game of Patience, or The Caviler of the Apocalypse.

review/text: The book is brilliantly written as long as it concerns itself with Orual's passionate indictment of the gods. It loses its power, however, when Lewis falls prey to his tendency to preach. Part 2 undermines the rest of the book first by telling the reader what to think and then by couching the lessons in an implicitly Christian moral context. In this way, it is reminiscent of &quot;The Last Battle,&quot; a coda which mars the otherwise enjoyable &quot;Chronicles of Narnia.&quot;

review/text: This book was horrible.I had to read it but in my own opinion this book really had nothing to do with witches.They only mentioned a few things about withches.For example ,when the main character{Kit}jumped in the water to save the little girl's doll,they just mentioned she could get in trouble for swimming.Another example of this would be how Kit was put on trail.They just said she was but it would have made the story a lot more interesting by adding the twist that she was found guilty. The story was actually about how dating worked back in colonial times.The author mentioned that in order to go out with someone that the male had to ask the father's permission in order to call on the female.An example of this would be when an admirer of Kit{William Ashby} asked Kit's uncle if he could call her out.He did this by sucking up to him then asking him his permission.In conclusion, my once again is that this book has nothing to do with witches or witch craft.

The complete dominance of honor, and the constant heroism and adventure in these books is heart warming, as well as thrilling. In this part of the series, somewhat to my dissappointment, John Carter is no longer telling the story, but his son, Carthoris, is. Readers of the first three books don't be alarmed however! Carthoris is &quot;just as good a story teller as his father.&quot; And the story is just as exciting.

review/text: I wasn't quite sure what to make of this book at first. My exposure to nuns was quite limited as I was not raised Roman Catholic. I always saw them as these cold, austere, soulless beings in these odd outfits on the periphery of everything.Once I had completed reading, the role these women play in people's live became much more clear. Yes, there were some truly vile women who were charged with shaping Karen (Sr. Martha) but they were doing what they believed and had been taught was necessary to create strong, obedient &quot;brides of christ&quot; as was expected of them by the church.I agree with one other reviewer that there should have been more information included about what was happening in the church during those turbulent times which would have significantly aided in the readers understanding of what was happening to Ms. Armstrong.I'm very glad that Ms. Armstrong discovered that her call to understand God didn't require her to be part of that hellish order and her contributions to religeon have done more than anything those probably long forgotten superiors of hers have ever added to human understanding.There's also another book I'd recommend if you can find it &quot;Behold The Women&quot; which has many wonderful essays from women who were part of various religeous orders. It also has a large number of pictures of many orders some of which leave you wondering &quot;...who in their right mind would want to wear something like this for the rest of their lives?&quot;.

review/text: The disparity between the contents of this book and its title may be judged by comparing a comment on the back cover with a section of the main text:Back cover:&quot;Rakoff - who was intended by McGoohan to play a key role in the scripting of future episodes - now reveals how the series could have developed, then and now.&quot;Main text (p.176, col. 1)&quot;McGoohan's promise that I'd have four episodes in the next tranche of the series was perhaps not seriously meant. It was probably only a well-meaning apology for having abandoned me in order to be free to go to Hollywood.&quot;In order to get this book in perspective you need to take full note of the subtitle - &quot;radical television and film in the 1960s&quot;.An even more accurate subtitle would have been &quot;Ian Rakoff, an autobiographical account of how I came to England and worked on a few films, and served as assistant editor on a couple of episodes of 'The Prisoner', during the 1960s&quot;.As Rakoff himself admits, he came &quot;in at the tail end of things&quot; (p23) as far as the making and editing of The Prisoner was concerned, and apart from a few brief and highly uncommunicative meetings with McGoohan, whatever he (Rakoff) knew about the series was gossip and hearsay.His version of the nature of the original 'Rover', for example, is clearly not from personal experience, and conflicts with evidence that there really was a blue VW 'beetle' with flashing light.He also suggests, for no good reason, that production manager Bernard Williams came up with the idea of using weather balloons; which doesn't tally with the more widespread report that McGoohan fortuitously spotted a weather balloon in flight and gave Williams the task turning this into a practical replacement for the VW bug.Not surprisingly, then, even that section of the main text that deals with the TV series (pages 23-100) consists almost entirely of vague anecdotes that are more likely to be of interest to film and TV technicians than to fans of the TV series. Nor is this section of the book entirely given over to items related to the making of The Prisoner, but regularly wanders off into pure autobiography, as in Chapters 5 and 7, for example.Having said all that, it might seem that Rakoff is still a key witness as regards the concepts and philosophy behind the TV series. After all, he did work as a writer on the series, didn't he?Well yes, sort of. It turns out that Rakoff wrote the basic story for the episode 'Living in Harmony' - but had very little to do with the final script. Indeed, on viewing the initial screening he comments:&quot;For a moment I couldn't believe I'd written any of what I was seeing. It seemed familiar but from somewhere far away and long ago. Dialogues struck chords.&quot; (p.98)The fact is that Rakoff based his own story on material in Gene Autrey (cowboy) comics of the 1950s. It's relevance to the central themes of The Prisoner was, (given his very limited time on the project), almost entirely co-incidental. And the episode as it was filmed and screened, owed nearly everything to series producer David Tomblin - who is credited as producer, scriptwriter and director on this particular episode.In short, if you're keen to lay your hands on 'anything' that relates to The Prisoner then you'll pobaby want to own this book as well.If, however, you're looking for material that provides genuine insights into this most enigmatic of all TV series then there are far better ways of spending your money.

review/text: By far the best part of this book is its droll, ironic, facetious demolition of the cultural relativists turned deconstructionists. As Gellner observes, relativism is good for allowing people their choice of wallpaper, little more.I was disappointed that there was not more in this brief book on fundamentalist Islam, since it was advertised as having been written as half of a duplex along with an Islamic historian.My main critique of Postmodernism ... is that Gellner presents the reader with a kind of intellectual 3 card monte. Postmodernism on the left is 'bad,' fundamentalist religion on the right is 'bad,' ergo, the only card left standing, in the middle, his brand of Englightenment Fundamentalist Secularism (as he candidly calls it) must by the process of elimination be 'good.'But those 3 categories are numerically incomparable. There might be 50 thousand committed postmodernists in the world--insignificant. There might be 400 million EFS's in the world, western europe plus bicoastal university USA. There are probably 2-3 billion committed religious believers in the world. But folks in Gellner's and the postmodern microcosms snobbishly condescend to those poor beknighted refugees from the 13th century.Gellner's big mistake here is to equate all sincere religious belief with fundamentalism, a bad gaffe for a sociologist, who should at least be able to correctly report what a given community thinks, believes, etc., even if he doesn't agree. But most Christians I know, and I believe most Muslims, and Hindus, are post rationalist, not pre-rationalist. That is, we take the best of the enlightenment, dredge its many infirmities, and add the good to the already very good religious faith. Two superb examples of this would be Popes John Paul II and Benedict XVI, both of whom were highly degreed and intellectually acclaimed in the maw of the enlightenment, saw its positives, rejected its weaknesses, and blended the one with the other, to create a superior development (not change) to 21st century Catholicism.Gellner is to be praised for admitting that the 2 attempts at putting 100% pure enlightenment-ism into political action were train wrecks, the french and russian revolutions. He also admits that his enlightenment fundamentalist rationalist secularist religion probably could have only grown up on Judaeo-Christian soil. But the problem is, is that the EFRS religion has been living off the fumes of Christendom for centuries, cutting the limb on which it is sitting, and soon the cultural vacuum which is europe (and bicoastal USA) will be ripe for plucking by immigrants with a more muscular response than 'whatever.'

review/text: "The Mayor of Casterbridge" ought to be the model of what a classic is not. Books deemed as a "classic" are said to be everlasting and universal in its message. This book does not spread its wings into our era, and it does not apply to everyone in some way, unless you've experienced paternity uncertainty and emotional neglect. The characters are rigid, changing without reason, and lacking practical emotions. Michael Henchard is repulsive from the start, from when he sells his wife and child, to his emotional withdrawal towards the young woman who turned out to be his non-biological daughter, to hiding the truth of who her father actually was to Elizabeth-Jane, so one cannot pity his outcome. Elizabeth-Jane, the non-biological daughter of Henchard, was completely void of personality. "Blas&eacute;" has more personality than Elizabeth-Jane. After a tennis match type life, of being flung back and forth between fathers, to marrying Donald Farfrae who one day courted her, married another woman (who just happened to be the landlord of the house Elizabeth-Jane was living at, at the time), and then realized his affection for her, Elizabeth-Jane would've been a prime candidate for therapy (how could she give her heart to men who kept being introduced as her father?), but instead acted as if she was a spokesperson normalcy. Finally, Donald Farfrae, a Scotsman, who was the poster boy for blandness, never really showed growth. He was always monotone, and I could not tell if he found Elizabeth-Jane's biological father to scorn Henchard, or truly help Elizabeth-Jane find the truth. I felt naught for the characters but purposelessness, and the story itself was uncreative and improbable. I do no recommend.

review/text: I first read this novel in 1972, on recommendation from another veteran of the American military advisory effort in Vietnam. David Halberstam captured the essence of the military advisor's duty, and the ambivalent nature of the US Army's approach to it, perfectly. From my perspective, as one who performed the duty in less luxurious circumstances than those described in the novel, there were some substantive inaccuracies. However, the inaccuracies are irrelevant when compared to the story in its entirety. I can say that I knew men similar to each of the characters in the novel--both American and Vietnamese--and Halbertstam depicted them very, very well. For one who served in such circumstances, even 45 years ago, the novel can evoke emotional responses. For a reader who has experienced military advisory duty anywhere, there should be at least some instances of reminiscence. For other readers, especially for those who would like to grasp something of the Vietnam conflict diffrent from the current conventional wisdom, this is a worthwhile read...take it from someone who has been there.

review/text: Usually I read &quot;general fiction&quot;, but I also like to read &quot;crime novels&quot; from time to time. Of course that good &quot;crime novels&quot; also qualify as literature. Take Graham Greene, for instance, or James Ellroy, the Tinseltown Dostoyevsky. Of course that it's a very tricky business, that of writing crime novels. And unfortunately, Ms. Cornwell's &quot;From Potter's Field&quot; falls a little bellow the mark.Let's take the character development, for instance. Or rather, let us not take it, since there isn't any. Scarpetta continues to be a paranoid b***h who simply cannot stop moralising for a second (I like strong women characters; unfortunately, this one is just irritating). Lucy, whose very existence should be considered a crime, manages to be more annoying than Jar Jar Binks. Gault barely manages to be ONE-dimensional, let alone be terrifying (he's about as scary as Dr.Evil from &quot;Austin Powers&quot;. Minus the jokes.) Marino is his usual amusing cardboard self and everyone else is just walking backdrop.But let us forget character for a while. How about the plot? After all, a good plot can save a crime novel, can't it? Well, not always, but in this case there is no plot. None that Cornwell hasn't written before, that is. Think about it: someone is out on a killing spree, Scarpetta takes on the case, Scarpetta goes here and there and finally, some name is pulled out of the filofax and thrown into the page, only to have him/her shot dead (usually by Scarpetta) at the end. The only difference here is that this time we *know* who the killer is, so the plot becomes quite obvious after the first twenty pages! Not that there weren't enough intriguing possibilities around: say, what has the Army got to do with everything? Or who exactly is Gault's father? (It would be interesting if Cornwell did a &quot;Chinatown&quot; here - you know: the scene where Evelyn (Faye Dunaway) reveals who is the father of her daugther - and came up with some really nasty solution to the question of Gault's parentage. Instead, it appears that Peyton Gault's brother was shagging his wife - duh!) But unfortunately, none of this leads anywhere. The &quot;plot&quot; merely goes on undeterred in its path towards Trite-city, Predictable-land. The only thing that starts out by being vaguely arousing is the scene where Scarpetta meets the Gaults. We aren't usually treated to this kind of viewpoint in the over-simplistic Scarpetta novels, so my hopes were high. What a major disappointment, considering that that scene is handled with all the subtlety of a demolition ball wrecking a building. I know that scenes like that are very difficult to write, but surely Cornwell could have come up with something better? After some time I came to realise that the purpose of that scene was to remind us how much &quot;The Sweet Hereafter&quot; was brilliant in its handling of the reactions of parents towards their wayward - or their lost - children.Also, since we are talking about Scarpetta meets the Gaults, let us pose a question: why, pray tell, is there no explanation concerning Gault's fixation on Scarpetta? And consider the following situation: two twin siblings, very similar genetic traits, very similar upbringing... so why was Jayne Gault such an angel and Temple Gault such a demon? Should we start calling for father Merrin here? (OK, so he snorts about six lines of coke a day, but so did Drew Barrymore before her reinvention and never was she seen indulging in a killing spree.) Also, if it was so obvious from such an early age that Temple Gault had some serious problems, why didn't his parents commit him to an institution? Did they hope that he would grow out of it? In a word, Conrwell's tidbits concerning Gault are pure and simply bizarre. It's so ironic that I re-read the brilliant &quot;The Talented Mr. Ripley&quot; by Patricia Highsmith before I picked up &quot;From Potter's Field&quot; - what a glaring contrast. Gault the classical Anti-christ? Compared to the wonderfully textured Tom Ripley he is just a complete ninny.There were some other things that left some bitter aftertaste in my mouth, such as the ever-present pro-death penalty stance (alright, Patricia, we know what your opinion is... enough already, OK?) and characters being fans of Ayn Rand's books (eek!!!). But considering the former, doesn't Cornwell know that the US is the only industrialised Western country to still have the death penalty? (Here in Portugal we got rid of that *in the late 1800s*.) Doesn't she realise that her arguments either mean absolutely nothing to the other countries where this is being sold or simply irritate lots of people there (myself included)? Also, why does Cornwell insist in portraying Scarpetta &amp; mates as defenders of a featureless society against criminals that are portrayed as &quot;complete outsiders&quot;? Is she afraid to face the real texture of a corrupt society, such as in &quot;Seven&quot;, for instance, and deal with the underlying problems? Since crime has been a feature of almost all human societies from the dawn of time, how about devoting some pages to that issue, instead of brushing it under the carpet?But I see this is getting too long, and I believe that I have stated the reasons to why &quot;From Potter's Field&quot; was a complete waste of time and money. If you want to read an interesting crime novel - a *real* novel - from the female perspective, read &quot;Smilla's Sense of Snow&quot;. If you insist in reading &quot;From Potter's Field&quot; go ahead, but don't say you haven't been warned. As for me, this was not the first Cornwell novel I read, but it will certainly be the last.

review/text: The good author believes the gentle reader is fascinated by detailed descriptions of underwater flora, fauna, and geology when, in reality, gentle reader is wondering when something is going to happen. Many is the retired gent who has come to me with his list of a kabillion classics he is supposed to read before he dies and I suggest he also check out maybe a cowboy and a mystery, but he does not and he never checks out anything again. Well, a "classic" is merely a book that is still in print, possibly because the publisher does not have to pay royalties on public domain titles. Now, this book is still in print; so, by golly, it indeed qualifies as a classic. And, it is just the thing to give to a reluctant reader to prevent him from ever checking out anything again. It is definitely not a fast read by modern standards. Not that TLUTS is not a great read, but it is hard work for an average reader and should not be required of the inexperienced reader. Thus the book deserves, perhaps, a 5 star for the experienced classic reader but only a 1 star for the novice.

review/text: For years Mykel Board had wanted to go to Outer Mongolia. He realized that dream in 1995 when he went there to teach English at the National University in Ulaanbaatar. EVEN A DAUGHTER IS BETTER THAN NOTHING is the result of his stay. This volume is not like any other travel writing you will read. It is at once hilarious, I suspect at times hyperbolic as well as downright moving in places. He writes with obvious affection for the people he encountered on his year there; and even though he lands in a country far removed from anything he has even encountered--"this is Mongolia"-- he is never condescending.Public transportion doesn't run on time, the plumbing doesn't work, classes are scheduled in the wrong classrooms, and signs saying someone takes credit cards usually don't mean that at all as Mr. Board repeatedly hears the mantra "this is Mongolia." What the writer does find is a lovable people not afraid of hard work and accepting of strangers. They dress up to have a photo taken, are offended if you do not eat their food-- even though you prefer not to eat unadorned fat-- poor Mr. Board at times reminded me a little of Cool Hand Luke's stuffing himself with eggs in the movie by the same name-- and can drink you under the table. These folks drink vodka like Americans drink Cokes. (I'm surprised that Mr. Board had a liver when he returned to New York.) He also found "Pro Wrestling, rock'n'roll, Christianity, and probably someday soon, McDonalds." But apparently no designer coffee shops yet.Although Mr. Board describes himself as a good instructor-- and I believe him-- he on several occasions uses incorrect English, always making the same grammatical error: "He wimps out, leaving Sebastian and I stranded" (p. 270) is incorrect. The sentence should read "leaving Sebastian and ME stranded" But you'll find much weirder stuff here. How about half a page of information on Mongolians as "snot-blowers"? Finally you'll read a long time before another travel writer refers to Peter North. (Oops. I'm not supposed to know that he is a famous porn star.)For those of us who will never go to Mongolia, Mr. Board has made a part of the world come alive, reminding us once again that all of us are more alike than we are different.Oh, about the title-- the author says that he wanted something catchy to get the reader's attention-- he is most successful-- but explains that the expression is an old proverb that has little to do with modern Mongolia.

review/text: The odd thing about this book is why it took so long to come out. Chris Gall is an illustrator and the great-great-grandnephew of Katherine Lee Bates so I wonder why he had not created these pictures ages ago.The sixteen stunning pictures were engraved on clay-coated board which makes them very graphic rather than watercolor soft and I enjoyed the little design touches here and there, for instance a picture of some Shoshone Indians in a boat passing a very streamline looking waterfall or a small town snow scene with the buildings placed at different angles to each other.The choice of image is also refreshing, to illustrate 'A thoroughfare for freedom beat. Across the wilderness!' has a family with their Airstream parked in the open landscape or 'Thine alabaster cities gleam, Undimmed by human tears!' showing a window cleaner eating his lunch and sitting on one of those Art Deco eagles on the Chrysler Building. This kind of originality and warmth comes across from each picture.The book is well produced and it occurs to me that these illustrations are so good and all the same size that they are worth framing, depending on one's favorites.

review/text: A mediaeval costume dram with a notable difference - twentieth century speak transposed to the 18th century in this visually satisfying and atmospheric tale of two gentlemen highwaymen who robbed from the rich aristocracy for their kicks! But the dialogue and the loud thumping techno music gives it an appeal to the older teenage generation who might not appreciate it if it were done in the style of, say, THE MAN IN THE IRON MASK. The highway robbery scenes are superbly done, Robert Carlyle and Jonny(LOVE HONOUR AND OBEY) Lee Miller relish their roles, acting as frivolously and as over the top as they can! Liv Tyler wears some particularly busty costumes as well. Filmed in London, Czech republic and Spain for the mediaeval building settings of old London and Newgate prison, this action-packed drama is best enjoyed on DVD for its soundtrack and atmospheric effects. Not to be missed!

Who ever thought that Keanu Reeve would have been perfect as John Constantine should be fired for sheer in competence. Keanu takes a great role and basically craps on it with his lousy acting. Of all the actors involve, only Rachel Weisz and Peter Stormare are able to transcend the horrible script, which manages to contradict itself in the last forty-five minutes of the movie, and the climax is a horrible joke in itself. The special effects were decent but I have seen better on TV plus the plot is taken from an episode of Buffy the Vampire slayer. They should have just called it Keanu The vampire slayer instead.

review/text: I bought all paperbacks from the first trio through last book and sat down and read them from beginning to end. I have to conclude that this story was the most disappointing of all of them. Unfortunately for me Sheildbreaker's book was the reason why I force fed some of the other bad ones. This book in paticular is bizzare and inconsistent as far a as plot and environment with respect to the series. In summary, I didn't like the way the other swords played out and I thought the characters were neglected and unengaging. As far as I am concerned this series found a creative niche to add personality and intrigue to all the swords, quite uncommon for this genre surprisingly, however, the plots, stories, chararcters, ideas and action scenes fell well short of a great series let alone good stories. I am sorry, but I cannot recommend this book (or series) to anyone. For what it is worth, Book 2 of swords was the best of them all. In some way, I wish the author could have a do-over with the swords concept. Great ideas, not so good implementation.

review/text: Let me confess, the author's being an Ericsson member (me, too :) further helped me to add this book to my library.I found this book an average book that is nothing but a good collection of information which you can find through internet.I expected the author to tell me from how to define effective user interfaces to how to combine servers, which directions to take about future apllications (positioning services, notification, charging etc.)I expected good examples from the industry, since the author was a practician, but I didn't find any concrete example from the real world that can really change the way I develop a WAP application (if I develop one).I didn't find these...Another reason for me to buy it was the CD-ROM. I thought it would be a good idea to have a collection of tools compiled in one CD for me. Let me tell you before you get frustrated like me. The whole 650 MB capacity CD contain the Nokia WAP Toolkit (an old version), and a WAP Toolkit of Ericsson plus Ericsson R380 emulator and that's it! No editors, no GPRS simulators. I still can not understand why did they stick such a content-less CD at the back of the book.Good luck...

review/text: Having put down "How Few Remain" largely out of disinterest, my yearning for a good World War II alternate history novel (before I learned of "Fatherland" and others) inevitably lead me here.Lizard-like aliens (called "Lizards" by humanity) invade Earth in 1942, expecting to encounter resistance from Earth in the 1600s, so thus they become embroiled in a turbulent version of World War II in which the Axis and Allies must work together to overcome the Lizards.Another reviewer pointed out that little thought was put into the Lizard's technology, which appears to just be a manifestation of 90s-00s military technology. From a certain point of view, that does appear remarkably true, but if it weren't for that reviewer, I would never have thought of that or imagined it as so.The writing is definitely no Steven Pressfield or Jeff Shaara, but it serves its purpose in being easily readable for most reading levels and progressing the plot.There is an immense amount of characters to keep track of, which can be disorienting sometimes, but also add different layers to the book to keep you from becoming sick of one character's tired old plight or whatever. The Lizards in particular are very interesting, and their reactions to humanity's aptitude in adapting is intriguing to listen to.Another major flaw which greatly irritates me concerns the leadership. For the first hundred or so pages of the book, NONE of the world leaders are shown or written about. And if it weren't for the exposition progressing different events, you'd think the leaders all suddenly died in the invasion, and the military and civilian populace is handling diplomacy and war on its own. Indeed, by the end of it, Adolf Hitler appears only once, yelling at Ambassador Molotov over the Jews "betraying" humanity by siding with the Lizards, Churchill acts as representative for Britain in peace talks among the world leaders, Stalin, Roosevelt, Hirohito, Mussolini, and other high ranking leaders (aside from General Patton and General Marshall) don't appear at all. For a story mostly centered around certain characters, this is okay, but considering this is the ONLY alternate history book series dealing with this sort of event, we'd like to see how the world leaders would react!I would like to see Hitler confronting Stalin and being forced to negotiate a peace and try to secure uranium for both countries equally. I would like to see Winston Churchill and Adolf Hitler arguing over military strategy. Instead, they barely ever show the leaders.Not only are the leaders barely shown, but major events happen as soon as they're mentioned. For example, the Lizards debate amongst themselves to make the tough decision to drop a nuclear bomb on Berlin, and in the next section, a character is hearing on the radio how Berlin was bombed yesterday or whatever. This happens a LOT, and it is annoying.The flaws aren't enough to detract from this being a highly entertaining series, with some genuinely likeable characters amongst the massive bunch. Not only are there three more in the series to look forward to, but three more when the Lizard Colonization fleet arrives, twenty years after the invasion...

review/text: Don't get me wrong; this video is good! The music is great, the artwork is lovely, and parents can enjoy it even though it's been played 100 times. However, the artwork/music presentation is like a piece of choreography that was overworked to hit everything in the music and ended up being less-than-pleasing. And then the makers slacked on editing the scenes/sounds of children talking and doing art. Also, each peice of artwork shown includes print of the title and artist on the lower corner ON the artwork (not off to the side), interrupting the enjoyment of the art. The print is very small and hard to read -- really distracting. Since the artists and titles should be shown somewhere, why not put that information at the end? This video tries but isn't quite the standard of Baby VanGogh.

review/text: The Rabbi's Cat is a wonderful book. I heard the author speak on NPR and got the book. The book is in the form of a comic strip, each box lovingly illustrated by the author. The pictures are wonderful, particularly of the cat. They are a joy to behold.Even better are the stories, anecdotes taken from the lives of the Jews in North Africa in the thirties. The stories are both very sad and hysterically funny. The cat has a sardonic turn of phrase that had me in stitches. Through the difficult medium of comics, the author has managed to capture the atmosphere of the time and place. Much of the book is given to musings about life, philosophy, love, God and so on. If you like a good discussion, you'll enjoy this book.Although the books can be enjoyed by non-Jews, I think if you don't know the basics of Judaism, you'll be missing the most vital part of the book. Of course, the book is so appropriate for the cat lover. The author clearly understands cats perfectly.

review/text: These work. Very well. But I worry that I won't be able to commit to spending 5 minutes on this every day. It's a couple minutes to apply step one, then a couple minutes to wait, then a couple minutes to apply step two, then wait a bit. Then the next step cannot apply alcohol or rinsing. So this needs to happen when you have the time and no plans to apply an alcohol product immediately afterward. So for me it seems like the best time to apply is an hour before bedtime. Then just before bedtime I can apply eye and night cream.This product is good for someone who has some fine lines and perhaps occasional surface acne. It is not for someone with sensitive skin. Please note that you will need to use skincare that provides more moisture while you employ this regimen because the exfoliation will cause temporary dryness.

review/text: I was excited when I found this book, not only because I had watched Saturday night live for as long as I can remember, but I was eager to learn what went on behind the scenes. And I received more than I bargained for, in all good ways. The great thing about this book is it is told by the cast, writers, producers, and NBC executives. It is from their mouths. It isnt rumored tales or reporters speculating. Of course there are different opinions and feelings, but for the most part, all the cast members seem to have the same feelings. They feel a brotherhood to eachother. When you watch the show, and see the sketches, one believes these people are just having a grand old time, and you dont realize how much is involved until you read this. It starts back in 75 with the original cast members, those who are still alive, talking about what it was like. Drugs involved, pressures, etc. It goes over deaths of Gilda Radner, Jon Belushi, Phil Hartman and Chris Farrley. Almost all the cast memebers ever on the show speak in this book, with the exception of Eddie Murphy who, for some reason doesnt want to be any part of Saturday night live, even though thats what made him. For most of the cast members SNL was their platform to stardom. There also is alot of bitterness present, as with Janeane Garafalo. Most of all the cast members and the writers feel pretty much the same about Lorne Michaels, the exucutive producer. He is the creator and the father figure. They all greatly seek his approval, which is scarce. But most look back at him in kindness.It is a great read, soooooo much information you would never have known otherwise. I really thought this would be one of those books that would last me a while and I looked forward to that, but because you know so many of the cast and are so interested in the words from their own mouth, you really cant put it down. Dont pass this one by!!

review/text: This album has been quite hard to get a hold of for a while, but here it is, remastered and featuring Howlin' Wolf backed by his powerful early-70s combo, the Wolf Gang, which included guitarists Hubert Sumlin and L.V. Williams, bassist Dave Myers, drummer extraordinaire Fred Below, legendary piano player Sunnyland Slim, and saxist Eddie Shaw.Wolf himself was in his early sixties at the time this recording was made, and starting to suffer from ill health, but he could still rise to his former heights when it came to winning over an audience.This album was originally issued on LP in 1972, and featured eight songs. Two excellent bonus tracks were added when it was re-released on CD, extending the running time to just under 65 minutes, and Wolf and his band sound thoroughly inspired all the way through. Howlin' Wolf doesn't perform any of his classic hits, but once you slip this disc into your CD player and turn up the volume you will hardly notice. These powerful live versions of songs like the driving "I Didn't Know", Big Bill Broonzy's "I Had A Dream" (in a thumping high-octane rendition), and the gritty "Don't Laugh At Me" are every bit as great as any Willie Dixon-penned R&B; hit.Opening with the eight-minute "When I Laid Down I Was Troubled", Wolf and the band swagger through one blues powerhouse after another, mostly mid-tempo numbers with a few slow grinds thrown in for good measure, like the supremely funky "The Big House". Wolf's vocal performance on that one is one of his best ever; he stretches out comfortably for over seven minutes, singing certain verses he likes two or three times as the band locks in with deadly authority. And the other bonus cut, "Mr Airplane Man", is Wolf working his one-riff voodoo for all it's worth, a swinging, soulful sax riff and a groove deep enough to get lost in.You won't find a tougher, more enjoyable live blues record anywhere. Muddy's Newport album is great, and so is John Lee Hooker's "Live At The Caf&eacute; Au Go Go (And Soledad Prison)", but this pulsating steam engine is live blues at its very best and grooviest. The sound is not truly stellar, in spite of the remastering, but once you turn it up and start rocking back and forth in your seat with your eyes closed, you won't care one bit.

review/text: This is a story of Patty Bergen, a trouble making, homely thirteen-year-old growing up on the American World War Two homefront. Patty's parents are verbally abusive, and her father is known to beat her on occasion. When a German POW escapes from the local prison camp, she allows him sanctuary in hidden rooms in her home. This German soldier proves to be her first love and one of the only people who truly loves her back.I, personally, would not recommend this book for pleasure reading. The novel had well-developed characters, and that was mostly what the author concentrated on. It seemed Bette Greene wanted to just develop a character, and not a story. When something tragic happens to Patty, I'm so busy learning everything about her that I did not shed a tear. Summer of My German Soldier seems to be an analysis of the adolescent human mind, not a novel I could fall in love with.

review/text: I recently saw this on my bookshelf and decided to read it again after a hiatus of many years. Well, time has not diminished the power of this book to engage the reader. Humorous and thought provoking, it allows the reader a glimpse into the mind of Bettina Balser, an upper middle class woman, living in Manhattan somewhere in the late nineteen sixties, who feels that she is losing her mind. Consequently, she begins to keep a diary, because she finds it cathartic. Through her diary, the reader sees a dawning awareness of self, a self that she has long repressed.Bettina married her husband Jonathan, when he was an idealistic up and coming Assistant District Attorney. When his political aspirations did not bear fruit, he left public service and became an insufferable, materialistic, social climbing corporate attorney. He is also a total control freak, planning every aspect of their lives and disparaging his wife at every opportunity. The sad thing is that he is totally unaware of what he is doing to his wife, so self-absorbed is he. They have two equally insufferable little girls, who seem to emulate their father at every turn. It is no wonder that Bettina feels that she is sinking into an abyss. It is as if she were a displaced person with no place to go, no place to run, no place to hide. Where has her self gone?The author takes the reader into the inner workings of Bettina's mind. The reader sees how she copes with her struggle to find the woman within the shell she has become. In its time, this book was viewed as being feminist in nature. What else would one call it, when the book is clearly about a woman's struggle with the hand that fate has dealt her simply by virtue of her gender? Although some of the references seem a little dated, such as the cost of certain things or the fact that everyone seemed to smoke cigarettes, it is simply reflective of its time and quite fitting. Full of humor, wit, and discreet social commentary, this is a book that has become a modern day classic.

review/text: Once again, David Gemmell leads us into the harsh yet fantastic world of the Drenai. The book is "Winter Warriors," and it showcases Gemmell's steadfast refusal to try to fix something that just isn't broken. If you're familiar with previous Drenai novels, the themes should be familiar - three old soldiers (a master swordsman with a tragic past, a bowman whose eyes are failing him, and a hulking brute with more heart than brains) find themselves embroiled in a quest to save Queen Axiana and her unborn son from the hordes of demons who seek them out. If the unborn king is sacrificed... yep, you guessed it, the world enters an age of unending darkness, and all mankind will suffer.It's true, you could fault Gemmell's cast of characters for being too archetypical, and bearing more than a passing resemblance to previous characters in the Drenai series (compare Nogusta of "Winter Warriors" to Chareos in "Quest For Lost Heroes," or Bison to Beltzer in the aforementioned tome)... but be that as it may, each and every principle character in "Winter Warriors" is a living, breathing, flesh-and-blood human being, and few fantasy authors can achieve such a claim. Each man and woman behaves in a realistic, believable fashion, and comes out of the adventure dramatically changed by the experience. In an attempt to wow you with magical doo-dads, action set pieces, and enigmatic creatures, most fantasy authors forget to inject humanity into their work - but not David Gemmell. "Winter Warriors" is a deeply human story, no matter what demons or magical spells come into play. The action works because you genuinely care about the people fighting for their lives... and if you know David Gemmell, you know too that no hero is immortal.I can find few faults in "Winter Warriors," to be quite honest. Granted, the premise is not very original, and the plot sometimes gets a little bit convoluted. Yes, "Winter Warriors" mimics the same themes of previous Drenai books (see "Legend" and "Quest For Lost Heroes," to name but a few), but I'm not sure that qualifies as a fault. It's very moving, inspirational stuff packed with at least as much drama as action. I just don't get tired of desperate men, underdogs by all accounts, standing up for what they believe in against seemingly insurmountable odds in the David Gemmell vein. If more of us lived our lives like Nogusta, Chareos, or Druss the Legend, I think this world would be a better place. Can I truly pay Mr. Gemmell a higher compliment than that?

review/text: This is not only my all-time favorite Steinbeck, but probably my all-time favorite book. Second place probably goes to EAST OF EDEN or Jackson McCrae's BARK OF THE DOGWOOD. Still, OF MICE is so much fun, so easy to read, and such a pleasure. Highly recommended for anyone wanting a good read.

review/text: Before listening to this recording, I had been just about convinced that Haendel's keyboard music was, at best, harmless, and at worst, disposable. How mistaken I was, and how apt Ludger Remy was to convince me otherwise. These suites, the 8 'Great Suites,' Haendel's major testament to Baroque keyboard music, are played with verve, character, courage, and nuance. Ludger Remy's subtlety is little short of brilliant, although I must say that occasionally he sacrifices grace for excitement, but then again, that harpsichord is a unique animal and occasionally one cannot blame the performer, really.Best of all, Ludger Remy breaks many of the conventions of the Dutch-dominated school of harpsichord performance and delivers and album defined by character and a unique sense of articulation and rhythm. Each suite movement is intricately crafted and interpreted. The Suites in A-Major and F-Major are both heart-wrenching, while the Suite in g-minor is shown by Remy to finally be playable (I thought that it was near impossible).Kudos to this fine performer, of whom we hope to hear more in the future.

review/text: I bought this stuff with hesitation but the price was so good I figured it was worth a try. I did check reviews on Amazon before I used it and after reading mostly positive I decided to go for it. I was pleasantly surprised how well it worked. I made sure my face was clean of all lotions, etc and was conservative w/ the placement for the first try - and wow - it worked nicely. Just follow the directions and it should work for you. Needless to say the shapers they have may not match your eyebrow shape exactly so you might have to shape the strips yourself a bit w/ scissors or just be careful in your placement on the brow.

review/text: I did not find this book particularly useful. The college descriptions are more like advertorials written by the colleges themselves rathen than objective and independent analysis with pros and cons. Furthermore the book provides little help with putting together an application for each of these schools - something the author could have done given his claim to know these institutions so well.

review/text: I first saw this great film when I was a kid. It was nice to view it again. It doesn't have any special effect or car race, but it is still a good suspenful thriller. Thank to the family who donated the body of their son to serve the effort of the war and thank to the British Intelligence Officer who thought of the deceiving plot, many British lives were saved. It was well worth the money to see it again and to lend it to my children. You'll enjoy it, I promise you. To you "Man who Never was" thank you.

review/text: Once the freshest, latest thing in show business, Saturday Night Live is closing in on _30 seasons_ on the air. I was 7 when the Not-Ready-for-Prime-Time Players made their debut, and first became a regular viewer in the pre-Eddie Murphy lean years, but I've always loved the show.Until the rise of Comedy Central and hundreds of cable channels, it was the only place on TV for political satire, and one of the few places for live music."Live From New York: An Uncensored History of Saturday Night Live" is a chronicle of the show's history, told by (most of) the people involved. I expected the book to be narrative, but it isn't: authors Tom Shales (TV critic for the Washington Post) and James Andrew Miller structured almost the entire book as a series of interview snippets about particular people, episodes, or events.The section on John Belushi's death, for instance, includes comments from more than a dozen people, including Belushi's family, friends and writers and cast members from the show.The approach is interesting when it lets you see multiple sides of a conflict or different perspectives on a cast member, as with the extensive quotes from Norm Macdonald, Lorne Michaels, and Don Ohlmeyer, who forced Macdonald's firing midway through the 1999-2000 season.It can be quite entertaining, as well, as we hear Joe Piscopo explain that his Sinatra impression was really a tribute, then hear from the writers who couldn't believe all the things Piscopo resisted on the grounds that "Frank wouldn't do that," including "Frank wouldn't eat in the Carnegie Deli," "Frank wouldn't wait for Stevie Wonder, Stevie would have to wait for Frank," and "Frank wouldn't jump off a building." Finally, in frustration, the writers considered a sketch called "Frank wouldn't do that."On the other hand, there are a lot of voices left out: Eddie Murphy apparently refused to participate, and of course former cast members John Belushi, Gilda Radner, Chris Farley and Phil Hartman and writer Michael O'Donoghue are now dead.It's usually the job of the author to provide an objective and critical eye on their sources. Here, that's mostly missing. Depending on whose quote you believe, Lorne Michaels is either the devil, a raging egomaniac, an opportunist who took advantage of the tremendous talent on the show, a gifted comedy writer, a creative genius, or all of the above.Still, you'll learn a lot about what happens in the manic week leading up to 11:30 Saturday nights here. What the heck does the host really do? How many sketches do they prepare in a given week?And there's a lot of SNL trivia, as well. Who was the first to say the "f-word" on SNL (I was surprised to learn it wasn't Charles Rocket)? Who was the first (maybe still the only) musical guest to lip-synch on the show?"Live From New York" also provides some interesting perspective on the show's history: When did the show shift to being a platform for recurring characters? What led to the "star turn" season with already established performers like Billy Crystal, Martin Short, and Harry Shearer?Still, if you're looking for a history particularly of the show's first decade, I would instead recommend "Saturday Night: A Backstage History of 'Saturday Night Live' ", by Doug Hill and Jeff Weingrad. Published in 1986, it's now out of print, but it's a very entertaining read that tells the story as, well, a story.If, on the other hand, you're curious about how the performers, writers, guests and executives behind the show look at it, "Live From New York" is the place to start.I noticed that there's also a book out now by William G. Clotworthy called "Saturday Night Live: Equal Opportunity Offender". I recognized his name -- he was the NBC censor assigned to the show in its earlier years, and the book is his chronicle of the standards and practices battles with the show.

review/text: This review refers to the DVD edition of "Run Lola Run" (or "Lola Rennt")....I had been meaning to view this film for quite some time. I had heard many good things about it, but kept putting it off. From what I knew of the story,about a girl only having so much time to save her boyfriends life, I was expecting something more like the Johnny Depp film "The Nick Of Time". So when I finally got around to it...wow..was I surprised and delighted by this cinematic treat.(and I was mad at myself for not watching it before this!)It's one of those you want to watch again immediately.The film is heart pumping, creative, innovative and fresh. The story will have you thinking about it for quite sometime. Our heroine Lola, finds herself with only 20 minutes to save Manni's life. It seems he has accidentally lost a huge some of money and the men it belongs to are not exactly the forgiving kind. He frantically calls Lola, as she is the one with the ideas.Lola immediately goes into action to try to prevent the horrors of what will happen if Manni doesn't come up with the money. So right from the start we are intrigued to see if she will pull it off.The film doesn't stop here though, it's just beginning. In 20 minutes, many things can happen to alter the course of a life. 'What if's' are the question here. What if that car was just a little slower, or what if a conversation went just a little differently? These are little things that can make big differences when it counts. It's a roller coaster of a ride, as we watch, and cheer for Lola,as she attempts to change the fates.The photography of this film is exceptional. Imagine trying to keep up with a running person all the time, and still coming up with incredible shot after shot. The music is fabulous and very much a part of the story.Franka Potente(Barbara from "Blow")is wonderful in her performance of Lola. Directed by Tom Tykwer, this German film is a must see for anyone who loves foreign films or just fine filmmaking.The DVD is presented in German(DD5.1 or Stereo Surround), with English or French subtitles. It may also be viewed in English(also DD5.1 and 2.0) if you prefer. There's a music video and commentary by both the Director and Potente that may be viewed during the film. It may be viewed in either the original theatrical widescreen aspect ratio or a full screen version. I highly recommend the widescreen that takes in all the great photography.Don't miss this exhilarting ride...go for it...Lauriealso recommended:Winter KillsLuzhin Defence (Full Screen Version)Blind Horizon

review/text: As one of France's premier authors of the 20th century, Antoine de Saint-Exupery's "Wind, Sand, and Stars" is arguably his greatest work among the several outstanding pieces of literature that he managed to publish before losing his life during a reconnaissance mission in WWII.Having served as a mail pilot whose routes took him across the Mediterranean to the African continent & later across the Atlantic to South America, Saint-Exupery demonstrates how aviation ---a profession that often allows for long periods of solitude and contemplation--- led him to make his most formidable discoveries of the enigma that we call "life." Here, we see through the eyes of a pilot as he remembers not only his perilous travels, but his observations about duty, courage, love, war, sacrifice, death, and other fundamental issues that we encounter during our existence on this planet.

review/text: I am truly impressed with this CD overall and what RCA is pushing as the first single on it is nothing compared to the rest of the cd. It is great to workout to, dance to, and sing along with. The music is &quot;POP&quot; but it is not a lot of sexed up junk. I have found my favorite song on the cd is &quot;Perfect Day&quot; if that is not released as a single they will miss out on some real chart popping magic. Clay Aiken still shows his talents and does each song justice. I give kudo's to him, the music writer's and the entire RCA group that worked on the CD. I cannot wait to see this young man do all of this in concert. I am curious as to what songs they took off of the cd and if RCA will be smart enough to have Clay croon some classics like he did on A.I. I would like to hear a studio version of Solitare, To Love Somebody, Somewhere Out There, and many others. I know that he is not a one hit wonder and we will be hearing from him for a long time to come God willing. Excellent CD!!!!

review/text: I used to love No Limit. I bought every single CD they released, wack or not. This CD and WWIII were two of the top five No Limit CD's easily, because they were about Fiend and Mac and not No Limit and Beats By The Pound ( which made No Limit what it was, the beats first and the rappers second, until the two previously mentioned CD's.) In truth, the majority of the CD's they released are all worthy of buying again. I just spent about $250.00 buying a bunch of their old CD's that I used to have back in the day and can't find anymore, NO MASTER P CD's! His CD's were disappointments except Last Don and Ghetto Dope. And where can I find TRU with Smokin Green on it instead of the bonus songs??????

review/text: Galbraith's insight on society unfortunately gets lost in a maze of double negatives and confusing sentence structure. His ideas are sound, though he has a very off-putting pompous delivery. In fact, his verbosity and poor structure is so bad, that it turns what should be a slim read into a fairly mind-numbing experience. The book really needs to go back to an editor.

review/text: I am very shocked to see so many reviews with five stars for this novel.It was bad, I mean real bad.Some one gave this to me several years ago, and I tried to read it then but it seemed so silly. I picked it up again thinking maybe I would change my mind (I have done that before). It was just as silly as the first time but I bore with it for the most part though I will admit I did some scanning.Besides the main flat characters, the long juvenile plot, and the horrid dialogue (the women's speech and thoughts are also juvenile) there is very little historical content. And it is over four hundred pages! The time period of the book was supposedly around the 1200's but very little in the book referenced that time period, facts or customs.It read like four hundred pages of romance clich&eacute;, but I suppose some people enjoy that style, and I am not knocking them. I just prefer a bit of substance when I read, and this book does not have any.Truth be told, romances can be a bit like fantasy. However I prefer mine with a touch of reality.

review/text: What is most amazing about Harrington's book is how accurately it describes today's society. The impact of this book, first published in the early 60s, is testament to the power that a single book can have on a nation and its people. It directly affected the thoughts and actions of President Johnson's "war on poverty". Unfortunately, this "war on poverty" may never come to a conclusion, even in the richest country in the world.The book itself contains a good introduction by Howe, who puts the impact of Harrington's work in context. Filled with statistics, which are unfortunately not well referenced, the case is made that the scale of poverty in the US is a travesty and an outrage. Harrington himself lived amongst the poor and disenfranchised members of New York's society for a brief period of time and he writes about their general hopelessness and lack of purpose in life. The descriptions and analysis of this book allow you to view the world through the 'lens' of poverty, to know (on a superficial level) the crippling and depressing lives of our society's poorest members. Harrington was perhaps the leading American socialist of his time, so be warned that his views and crituqes have a liberal/leftist stance and that much of the book disparages the efforts of the US government (perhaps, rightly so).As an added bonus, this edition of the book includes some insightful afterwords by Harrington about poverty in the 70s and 80s. Overall, an important and powerful work that is a must-read for anyone concerned with the issue of poverty in the US (which should be everyone, shouldn't it?).

Overall, the heater feels cheaply made and soemtimes it doesn't work; I have to unplug and replug it to make it go again.The markings for the two knobs (left for power/fan level, right for thermostat) are *very* hard to see; they are almost non-existent. This is a very stupid design decision.I wouldn't buy this heater again despite its low price and good safety features.

review/text: This book was very interesting and real from the begining until his relationship with Tina. Ike was definitly an important part of the history/creation of Black Music/Rock 'N Roll. That's why I give his book two stars.However, when Ike starts to discuss Tina, it gets confussing. One needs to take notes in order to keep up. He's constantly contradicting himself and blaming Tina for his actions. That's an abuser. I've found that you have to take whatever Ike Turner says with a grain of salt. Over the years, either on tv, print media, Tina's book, then his own book, Ike's story is always changing. It's gone from he only slapped her, he only hit her once, to he never hit her at all. However, the story from Tina (and others) has always been the same. There are definitely two sides to every story and the movie &quot;What's Love&quot; totally had some facts mixed up, but Ike needs to get one story and stick with it.I was also disappointed with the contribution by Little Richard. I was confused because since I've been alive, this man (rock music's own Richard Simmons) has argued and insisted that he is the &quot;architech of rock 'n roll&quot;. Hey, no argument here. But suddenly, Ike Turner writes a book and Little Richard now says that Ike is the architech. And Ike did record what is considered the first rock record, &quot;Rockket 88&quot;. What really got me though was when Little Richard insulted Tina. Is it me, or is that unprofessional? Ike is always saying that he has nothing against Tina, but he allowed these insults to be printed in his autobiography-in which he claims that he has no career because of her. Will it ever end?I would recommend this book only if you have nothing else to read and you've borrowed it from the public library. However, there are several other books on the history of Rock music/Black music that are much better.

review/text: I've been using this product for 3 months after evaluating other products such as Pharos, Navman and Socket.The strong points are:1) quick TTFF(Time to First Fix). A cold fix usually can be obtained in under 2 minutes. Make sure it is mounted with a clear view of the southern sky. You can use a velcro sticky from a crafts store if the rubber surface is not adequate to prevent sliding. Most peoiple mount it on the dashboard. Be careful in hot sunny climates as the black surface can cause the unit to overheat.2) Long Battery life: you can expect up to 8 hours with the lithium ion rechargeable battery. This is pretty good for most bluetooth receivers.3) Works well with IPAQ devices. No pairing relationship is required. This is often not the case for other bluetooth receivers.4) The mapping software is no-frills and works vey well. You can store important locations as favorites and also use addresses from your contacts on your PDA.Cons:1) The Black Case can cause unit to overheat in sunny locations when placed on the dashboard.2) Glare from the PDA screen is noticeable in sunny daylight situations. This is a problem eveident in all PDA GPS solutions. It is safer and less distracting to rely on the spoken directions as the GPS will warn you well ahead of any turns. I would recommend using a quality vehicle mount with external speaker and charging built in. The ARKON unit is a good device.3) Low audible output. Again, an external vehicle mount is a good idea when using this in your car.

review/text: A mishmash of speculation, hearsay and interviews taken from uncredited sources, Sweet's book will probably still find a fascinated audience among most hardcore Danfans. Those who are well-read in the interviews of ex-band members and related studio guys will instantly recognize many of the quotes in this work, however Sweet does not credit any of the actual sources of these quotes and would lead the less investigative reader to believe he spoke with many of these musicians himself (instead of simply culling the quotes from Modern Drummer or Guitar Player). In that regard it is somewhat of a hack job. The writing style itself is somewhat poor, and there are some embarassing factual errors. All this said, I'll admit I gobbled it up, simply because I was it does provide a hearty dose of Dan information and folklore in one convenient package.

He was a warm &amp; caring man who loved his music and passed the feeling on to his audience. Another reviewer said she felt &quot;goosebumps&quot; when she heard his music again on the CD's, and I agree. The music world lost a great entertainer when Dick passed away, he sadly never achieved the star billing that he so greatly deserved.The way range of his voice was unreal The set of CD's was purchased as a surprise Christmas gift for my husband, but I couldn't wait that long to hear it. Beautiful music &amp; memories! We have nearly all of his original singles and albums but nothing can compare to this. Anyone hearing him for the first time will want to hear more.!!

review/text: the first and last chapters were philosophical reviews of life (comparing the exciting aspects of flying which makes life seem so vibrant) against the mundane life of bureaucrats and peasants who live and die without seeing the world (as he does from the air). A line in the closing chapter is poignant: the infant that he is sitting next to has the potential to be anything and everything; but due to its parents and its probable future life, it wont ever realize its potential (they killed Mozart).the second to last chapter is a number of stories of the war in Spain (Franco; remember this was written about the late 1920s to the 1930s), with people fighting; it's a social commentary on war from the perspective of life and death (and has NOTHING to do with flying). This is a very long chapter (50 pages out of a 229 page book) and I was disappointed because I was'nt into reading about this.all the other chapters were of flying (and crashing, such as surviving in the desert), were good, and I wished there were more of them.overall, its an uneven book because it covers more areas than just flying (or even flying from the perspective of life & death). As a recommendation, I could take it or leave it.
