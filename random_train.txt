review/text: I was very disappointed with the book because it touched on a lot of issues that we as black women deal with, but it never really addressed them. The title is very misleading and to me doesn't even really match with the storyline. I got the impression that maybe as she was finishing the book she got tired and kind didn't really put forth an effort to give the book a meaningful ending. I was very disappointed with the ending and thought it could have been much better. The rest of the storyline jumped around and the plot just didn't make a lot of sense at times - what one thing had to do with another wasn't clear. Like I said, the book touched on a lot of good issues, but provided no good resolution for the characters.

review/text: This is a much updated version of his already excellent first edition.In this edition he shows even less restrain in going against the ADA "Party Line". Maybe because since the first edition there are now several studies clearly showing the benefits of a low carbohydrate diet for everybody, especially diabetics. The good doctor names names, always telling why he is doing so.In this edition he doesn't praise the "glycemic index" anymore, the only not so good recommendation in his first book.My father was diagnosed diabetic six years ago. I gave him a copy of the previous edition of this book and a glucose meter. His life changed. He not only has excellent health with little medication, he also learned to so some "controlled extravagancies" and can eat and drink at parties and events. The he loaned the book to a friend of my brother that reversed his diabetes, sex life included. He even founded a self-help group in his hometown.If you are diabetic, has a loved one who is or if you have "metabolic syndrome", that is, is a diabetic in the making, STOP WHAT YOU ARE DOING, GET AND READ THIS BOOK RIGHT NOW.

review/text: Gentle readers, beware! Finnegan's Wake is the most difficult book I have ever tried to read. Joyce's play with language, plot, and myth make for one of the most difficult readings in the history of literature.On the other hand, I can say (honestly) that the last ten pages of this book are my favorite in all the world of books. After the twentieth reading, or so, they began to make enough sense to my feeble brain for me to fall in love with this truly spectucular work of language.

review/text: I read this book shortly before the first anniversary of 9/11. I was truly inspired by the stories of how ordinary people rose to the occassion at a time of great need for our country and our world and prayed that our current generation would have the courage and fortitude to do the same. However, the writing style of Brokaw left much to be desired. His passages too often read like the overly earnest writings of a young English Lit major. However whenever the book returns to the actual words and recollections of the veterans, my spirits soared. Definitely worth reading for the example this generation put forth for all of us to follow.

I have been a network consultant for 10 years and I fix all the computer hardware problems for my company. This printer feed problem is not something that can be fixed by reading the manual. For your information, I am using HP Color Inkjet paper. It printed a few pages fine in the beginning then started jamming on every single sheet. I have to manually help it along by pushing each page for it to catch the paper. Sometimes it just grabs a stack of 30 sheets. It has a poor paper pick up design and that is a fact.

review/text: True, DigiCube no longer manufactures this OST, and the best you'll find is some pirated version from Son May or Ever Anime, but either way, get your hands on this soundtrack. It's a brilliant piece of music elegantly composed by Ms. Shimomura, who is now known for her works on Kingdom Hearts.The first track, Primal Eyes, is crafted to fit the game to a Tee, but leave it alone and you have a beautiful techno song. The soundtrack progresses to invent new compositions that hadn't been offered around 1998, and still can't be offered as enthusiastically as Yoko Shimomura herself has. As I've said; pick it up. You won't be disappointed!

review/text: Well, I finally got the chance to see the movie which won Isabelle Huppert Best Actress at Cannes, the movie which David Lame and his not so merry band of God Botherers tried to stop from being screened in NZ (without them having seen it). Lo, they have turned this movie into a decent sized hit as a result. THE PIANO TEACHER is actually the best SPCS publicized movie I've seen to date. Brilliantly directed by Michael Heneke, who scripted from Elfiede Jelinek's novel.Huppert plays Professor Erika Kohut; a cold, brutal, seemingly prudent piano teacher at a prestious music academy. But behind her icy facade lies an obsession with pornography and sadomasochistic sex. When a gifted young piano student (Benoit Magimel) comes under Erika's tutelage, he doesn't play to her impossibly high standards and as a result bears the brunt of her wrath but he soon finds himself falling in love with the professor who just seems to enjoy playing mind games with him. Though unknown to him Erika is gradually losing control under the influence of her domineering mother.THE PIANO TEACHER is exceptionally well photographed with a complex structure and a brilliant perfomance from Huppert (In fact you easily forget she IS just an actress playing a part).There are some rather grim scenes including plenty of S&M;, a funny drive-in theatre peeing scene and Erika putting broken glass in a girls coat pocket. I'm not sure if this will get a DVD release in NZ, but it deserves to. THE PIANO TEACHER is a masterwork that commands a wide audience, and it was probably only because of its content that it was overlooked by the Academy. One of the best movies I've seen recently.

review/text: The Swrod in the Stone is the first in a mini-series, and by far the best. The others are really flat in comparison.I just love this book, it describes all the magic of being young and exploring the fields and rivers around your home, and talks of fights between rather nasty witches and pleasant wizards. The writing is so good I felt like I was actually lying in the grass on a summery day watching people joust! Young Wart gets up to some crazy adventures, and the book has a nice happy ending. The author certainly introduces some interesting characters, and overall, I found it a joy to read, and one of the few books I reread regularly.

review/text: This is one of those books that you come across in your life that people talk about and mention to you a few times and eventually you get around to reading it. Since it's only about 123 pages long, it is definitely a quick read. The storyline goes at a good pace and there's just enough happening to keep you interested in the plot.Most people I've talked to about this book didn't care for the lack of details. That didn't bother me so much. The only reason that I am not giving this book a better review is because of my frustration with the main character. If Mersault would just CARE about something, anything, the outcome of this story would be so much different. Sure, this is the point the author is trying to get across, but still. I found Mersault's stand-offish attitude to be very frustrating.This is definitely one of those books that you want to discuss with a friend when you are finished, so be sure that if you grab this book, grab another copy for a friend as well.

review/text: I went to Frye's Electronics 3 weeks ago to purchase the Creative Labs 40GB Zen Xtra, when I noticed the Polaroid Juke Mam. I was impressed by the FM tuner - complete with 10 presets (it even records FM programs to MP3 files), the voice recorder, and nice large LCD screen were nice too. It was also priced within $10.00 of the Zen Xtra, so I opted for this unknown (unresearched) option.The sound was great, and I really loved how easy and logical the modified joysick-style selector button works. A week later, and after loading over 19GB of data to its hard drive, the thing simply locked-up and would not reboot. Fry's promptly replaced it for another. The second player's screen began to fade beyond readability after 4 days. That window gave me time to remove most of my data, and return the second Juke Jam to the store.This time, I traded it for the 40GB Zen Xtra. I have had ABSOLUTELY NO PROBLEMS with the Creative Labs model. The product rep was there in the store. He told me they recently upgraded the firmware, allowing simple drag-and-drop tranfer of data. It not only performs better, but it also has an AWESOME EAX sound enhancement tool. Honestly, it made my very basic car stereo sound like I was listening to my BOSE home theater!!!He mentioned they should be releasing a player with an FM-tuner soon, but I wanted my portable music options now. The features of the two items may appear to be similiar; in fact, the Polaroid features look better at first glance. But, I have to put my money (nearly $300.00) where the quality is. Creative Labs created a portable music experience! I don't mean to sound like some kind of spokesman for CL, but this thing simply ROCKS!!!Did I mention it's nearly $200.00 cheaper than the IPOD (which by the way, does not play the smaller sized, better quality WMA files). I LOVE the size of the IPOD, but that feature doesn't come close to justifying it's $489.00 price tag. Macintosh has once again, priced themselves out of the market. Sure there are thousands of people that have IPODs, but they could have cornered the entire MP3 portable player market. Fortunately, Apple once again let the competition create feature-packed players for $100.00's of dollars less.If you want real quality in a player that plays MP3, WMA's, and features an unmatched sound processor, go with the Zen Xtra. If you've got the money, and don't really need as much space as I do, get the IPOD. Otherwise, wait for more of the research and design to shake-out in this industry. There are sure to be some very interesting innovations coming to this Christmas!!!Today - ZEN XTRA ROCKS HARD!!!

I would not recommend it for people that have backgrounds in other programming languages, unless they like a challenge. I recommended this book to a friend, who programs in VB, and he could not finish the book (although he mentioned to me that he enjoyed the section on OOP). I have a C background and enjoyed the book thoroughly, and still use it as a quick reference. If you are an advanced Java programmer, don't bother with this book, get something more advanced.

review/text: ...maybe not, but they sure came close! What strange songwriting by this most bizarre of bands. Ranging from psychedelic to hard rocking to progressive to just bizarre--I don't know if listening to this is a guilty pleasure, or if it really is as good as I think it is.I won't bother with Beatles comparisons, others have written about that. I will say that the music contained here lies somewhere between post-Sgt. Pepper era Beatles, early Alan Parsons Project, Meddle to Animals era Pink Floyd, and (yes) Radiohead. Then again, other songs remind me of other bands: "California Jam"(Beach Boys), "Anus Of Uranus" (Crack The Sky), Sir Bodsworth Rugglesby (The Boston Symphony meets The Muppets). It is just a strange mix of demented music.What is most amazing to me about this CD is the production of the music. The sound quality is just awesome, with all sorts of effects, guitars and keys swirling around inside your headphones. Now keep in mind that I say this about the double album CD version. I have heard that this is actually a very flawed mix compared to the individual remasters. I have not heard the other versions, but I can say that I think the double album version is great. (I may have to buy them seperately to hear what everyone's been talking about!)Anyway it is in the production of sounds that draws my comparison to Radiohead. To me, listening to this CD for the first time was much like listening to "OK Computer" or "Kid A" for the first time. There is a lot to listen to, and I mean that in a good way.At the price that Amazon has this available for, I would recommend the two-fer package. If you want to check the remasters individually, I would recommend the following:Klaatu: (a.k.a. 3:47 EST) Buy this one if you are more interested in the more rocking "Beatles-ish" sound.Hope: Buy this one if you are more interested in the "Pink Floyd-ish" sound.Hope this helps.

review/text: "Flyboys" is amazing. It manages to be a dull movie about a fascinating subject, the Lafayette Escadrille, a dull love story, and a dull movie about Great War dog fighting, which this reviewer did not believe possible.Although the film is trying and makes an effort at historical detail and dramatic content it falls flat. The viewer doesn't get chance to know any of the characters ably played by some new faces as well as the venerable Jean Reno. (Reno must have a bell that rings in his agent's office every time an American script calls for a French character.) But no amount of acting can pull this lack luster script from the trenches of tedium.The missing piece in "Flyboys," other than the absence of Von Richthofen, is the near complete lack of any actual aerial photography. "Top Gun" is a mediocre film at best but has phenomenal aerial photography which is exciting and engaging. In "Flyboys" we have only CGI which is sterile. The performers don't have close ups of their faces against sub-zero wind (for which they are woefully underdressed) which detracts from the danger and excitement of a film about Great War pilots. It is obvious they are against a green screen in Vancouver. If "Flyboys" had gone the extra mile and had at least one dog fight done for "real" it would have saved the film. Granted, there aren't may flying bi and tri planes in the world but if massive trebuchets can be built for "Kingdom of Heaven," and Fort William Henry can be rebuilt for "Last of the Mohicans," and fiberglass tanks can be built for "A Bridge Too Far," and a working Tiger can be found for "Saving Pvt. Ryan," then I'm sure the producers of this film could have found a way to bring some excitement to "Flyboys."However "Flyboys" will be a boon to sleep researchers who now have a new way to put test subjects to sleep without the side effects of narcotics or entertainment value

review/text: Forget about reading into any meaning that you think this film may offer. The director is known as just a person who likes to mess with your brains. Anyone who has seen his previous works will snap this one up in an instant. Those who enjoy this movie will likely try his other fine beverages for the head.Basically the protagonist, a sexually insane music teacher, is as mad as bag of hammers yet manages to stay somewhat somber in her profession because she fits in with the rest of the snobs, but deep inside she is totally and completely bananas with a surreal sized suppressed sexual appetite to boot. So she walks the music halls with his lemon sucking expression among all the other lemon suckers who are sucking their lemons for very different reasons to hers and for this reason nobody really knows who or what she is like.When a music student falls head over heels in love with her they set out on a voyage of absolute debauchery in every nock and cranny that they can do it in. However his love of her is totally blind to her madness. He perceives her sadomasochism as an extension of her frustration when in fact that it just another major part of her psychosis. As they delve around with each other (sometimes very violently) the viewer begins to understand that this is really just a very sick woman who needs treatment fast and yet the world she works in and her lover can not identify it. In fact many viewers will fail to grasp that the main character is crazy until the very last scene which drives the message home like a knife to the heart.This is great art-house cinema and as an insane movie ranks up there with the best of them. Some of the [] scenes are very close to X-rated material and certainly many viewers will be put off by that and the heavy amounts of violence that are sometimes on display. In short, this is a great movie about insanity, love and professionalism rolled into one. The characters in this movie are unique and the film is certainly deserving of the acclaim it received.Challenging.

review/text: The temptation to re-make movies is evidence of the fact that there is little creativity in Hollywood. This movie is evidence that there are people in Hollywood who should not be allowed to go to movies let alone make them.The original is not all that great, but it was in fact original and had some very interesting photography and stunts. This version is insipid to the point of stupidity; the photography stinks, and the stunts are mostly cut-and-paste special effects.The people who made this should be banned from any association to movie making for life! So why did I buy it? By mistake! I had a copy of the original and thought a comparison would be interesting. I was wrong. Learn from my error and avoid this like the very plague.

review/text: I buy a lot from Amazon, but I don't write a lot of reviews. This rice cooker, however, is amazing. I got it overnight, just unpacked it, and made delicious, chewy, creamy, nutty steel cut oats in about an hour. Use 1 rice cooker cup of McCann's oats, 3 rice cooker cups of water, select the porridge setting, and come back in about an hour. Stir in the juice that rises to the top and enjoy. Brown rice pudding is next. I have to get up really early some days, and I can't wait to pre-program in a hot breakfast. Think of it as a slow cooker for people with a sense of urgency!The ZCC10 is extremely well made and easy to clean. I also recommend the Ultimate Rice Cooker Cookbook by Hensperger and Kaufmann, which has lots of good ideas for rice and more.So far, the only thing I can see to look out for is to make sure that you measure consistently. Use the 180 ml rice cooker cups for the grain and the water, or use larger kitchen cups for the grain and the water to get the right ratio. Also, the unit comes with a nubby plastic spatula/scraper thingy that won't mar the nonstick finish of the bowl. Cleaning is a breeze with cold water and a microfiber cloth.It's a little pricey, but well worth it because it has just about every setting you'll need to make more than just plan rice.Here's the cookbook link:The Ultimate Rice Cooker Cookbook : 250 No-Fail Recipes for Pilafs, Risottos, Polenta, Chilis, Soups, Porridges, Puddings and More, from Start to Finish in Your Rice Cooker

review/text: The Autobiography of Benjamin Franklin was a comical adventure through a life that expresses the ways of an ideal American. Franklin was a husband, friend, printer, inventor, scientist, writer, educator, diplomat, and a politician. Franklin's style of writing was cheerfully humorous (how his friend sucked at writing poems was my personal favorite part) and was made even better by the fact that he was able to laugh at himself. I enjoyed his take on the public's opinion of his papers on his experiments with electricity. He did not get defensive because of his cool, confident personality. I loved the part about the other scientist, Abb&eacute; Nollet, who 'could not at first believe that such a work came from America, and said it must have been fabricated by his enemies at Paris, to decry his system.' Overall the book was entertaining and a classic story, but I do not think that I would call it a favorite.

review/text: Having not read the book, I really didn't know what to expect. Let me tell you it was a pleasant surprise. For starters, Diane Lane was the perfect choice for the lead character Frances Mayes. She brings a natural reality to the character, instead of the saccharin sweet typically found in a romantic comedy. Diane instantly makes you feel like you know this woman. She's your neighbor, or someone you work with. In the scene after she learns of her husband's infidelities, she looks horrible - exactly like you'd expect like a woman would look after traumatic news. Of course Diane Lane is a very beautiful woman and as the movie progresses that becomes more and more apparent. Luckily Diane is more than just a pretty face and her performance is stellar. The movie as a whole is understated, letting things play out instead of spelling everything out and Diane provides a wonderful tapestry for you to see what is happening to her. Her reactions tell you more than pithy dialog ever could and as a result you end up taking the journey with her.As much as I loved Diane Lane in this movie, she is surrounded by an incredible supporting cast. Sandra Oh, as the best friend, delivers an authentic performance. Instead of the typical "funny sidekick" so often played by those in the role of best friend, she's down to earth and real. Raoul Bova plays the Italian lover and should make most women weak in the knees, but I found Vincent Riotta, the real estate agent, to be a much richer character. And speaking of rich characters, Lindsay Duncan plays a wonderful eccentric as Katherine who almost serves as a fairy godmother.Although the acting is superb, what bring it all together are the talents of Audrey Wells who serves as the screenplay writer, director and producer. Most of Audrey's background has been in writing. Clearly Ms. Wells has a love of Italy and a love of the novel and all of that shows on the screen. She filmed in the cities that are represented and she hired actors that are the nationality in which they play and the age in which they should be. The entire film shines with authenticity and coupled with wonderful performances and directing, Audrey has redefined the romantic comedy. This movie is a tune-up for the soul. If anyone has been down on their luck or not so lucky in love this movie will pour some sweetness into that bitter place. Highly recommended.

This one was predictable, had Travis doing things that unpleasantly surprised me, and the ending was something cheap and quick. I never felt like I was "there" with him as I have in other books.As far as being a tired effort from the end of MacDonald's career, "The Lonely Silver Rain" was written in 1985 and was much better in my mind. I would just save "A Tan and Sandy Silence" for later or last. Go through the ones that are just gold first.

review/text: I Spit On Your Grave is perhaps one of the best revenge stories ever told on film. The story is very captivating and the gore satisfies. Only a few revenge movies have really had an impact, And this is one of them.The story revolves around a beautiful author who is taking a peaceful and relaxing vacation in a cabin. Of course this is all blown to hell when a local man and his pals notice the young woman at a gas station. He finds it practical to follow this woman and attempt to make a play at her. When she declines, He dosen't take no for an answer.He and his pack of goons brutally rape and beat her to the point of death . But when she recovers she isn't going to let it slide that easily. She suduces the leader of these men who just so happens to have a wife and children into believing that she liked what happened. And wants more. Of course this is not the case. She gets him into a position to where he is so comfortable that he lies back and lets her cut his penis off. In a hilarious scene that is guaranteed to make a male viewer squirm.The film is controversal, But we already know that. We already know that it was considered a woman hating piece of garbage. Never the less i'm not going to go into a big story about it.I hope that you decide to purchase this film. It will make any horror fans day!

review/text: If I could give five stars to the audience I sat with, I would. There were only two seats left in the entire theater (I think it seats about 300), and everybody sat quietly, watched the film, didn't talk on their cells and were polite. I don't think I'll ever run into a crowded audience like that again in life. FIVE STARS FOR THE NEW 400 THEATER!Cons: I said this about Fast Five and I'll say it again about this film: I miss strong female leads. Although Frances McDormand was a leader, her character was annoying. Rosie Huntington-Whiteley, on the other hand, was just in the way. Unlike Megan Fox, who was beautiful, sexy and a strong enough character that she could roll with the guys and fix cars too, Rosie's character was this irritating Damsel in Distress who constantly needed saving. Her character, Carly, was CONSTANTLY being saved by Shia LaBeouf's character Sam Witwicky. I just wanted her to hurry up and fall out of the Sears (if you insist, I'll call it "Willis") Tower so we could go on with the film. She didn't add much to the film besides owning a car, and I already knew the secret to the car as soon as I found out she had one. John Turturro's character Simmons was another one who wasn't really necessary. I liked him far more than Carly, but both of them could've been removed from the film and it wouldn't have made a bit of difference. The world still needed to be saved. I heard the guy next to me in the movie theater complain about there being too many subplots, and I agreed. But for a different reason. I wish the main plot would've been developed more and the romance developed less. It slowed the film down. There was more action than there was plot.Pros: The action scenes were outstanding. Of course being a Chicagoan, I was excited to see all of the Chicago scenes. There's a special place in my heart for Bumblebee and Optimus Prime. I LOVE those characters. I love all the Transformers, and it was fun going down memory lane and remembering all the times my older brother talked me into playing Transformers with him. I think Shia LaBeouf is great. I love to see him in action, and ANYTHING Tyrese does is going to catch my attention. He is gorgeous and a great actor, too. He had a stronger lead in this film, which was a definite perk. Speaking of perks, all the brothas in this film were cute (ex. Markiss McFadden as Lennox Team 'Baby Face'). Wow! Lester Speight's character Eddie added much wanted humor, and I laughed at the heart attack line. And I will ALWAYS love the actors who play Sam's parents, Julie White and Kevin Dunn, because I don't think two other actors could be funnier than they are in an action film like this.Overall, good film, but nothing beats the first one.

review/text: Josephine Tey's heroic Inspector Grant finds himself literally flat on his back in hospital: the result of his previous adventure. Unable to engage his mind on a case in the police blotter, he stumbles on mystery that is 500 years old. Who killed the princes in the Tower?Part historical tableau, &quot;Daughter of Time&quot; is a true detective story. Just because the witnesses are long dead, written accounts remain and Grant's (i.e. Tey's) exegesis separates fact from propaganda. Intermixed with the history are Tey's charming cast of characters more reminiscent of a Noel Coward comedy than a traditional British mystery. Characters appear cliche at first introduction, but become more supple as the novel and Grant's recovery progresses.Having the benefit of Derek Jacobi's narration, the players in the story are quite vivid. This is most appreciated early in the novel when the reader is introduced to the several characters of the cast at once. Later, Grant has moments of reflective solitude, and Jacobi ably translates this quiet time.It is no wonder that this book is very popular. There is a little something for everyone. Fans of historical fiction get their fill. Students of history can learn the importance of first hand accounts. It still is very much a detective novel, and the characters are all likeable. (The one true bad guy has been dead since the 16th century.) It even carries the banner of a moral crusade: the pursuit of truth and the defeat of tonypandy.But Jacobi's narration enlightens one of the drawbacks of this work. Just when the incidental characters -- the ones that will not appear in the next Grant adventure -- develop, the story ends. Unlike Grant and his regular cronies who have been sketched and shaped in previous stories, these new people grow with the reader. We like them and miss them when the novel ends. And &quot;Daughter of Time&quot; does end abruptly. The case is closed, and the colorful world of the last Plantagenets and first Tudors is closed with it.

It sat on my shelf for about two years. But I eventually picked it up with the desire to become more &quot;relationship oriented.&quot;The chapters are nice and short -- they can be ingested in about twenty minutes. That's very convenient for me.

review/text: When we bemoan the awful disco of the 1970s, we forget the creatuve force of writers like Jimmy Webb. His &quot;Reunion&quot; album with Glen Campbell (in fine voice--light years from his insufferable &quot;Rhinestone Cowboy&quot; days)--features excellent imagery-laden lyrics with heart-tugging melodies and gorgeous string arrangements that never seem smarmy. &quot;Wishing Now,&quot; &quot;It Must Be a Sin,&quot; and &quot;I Keep It Hid&quot; are worth the whole price of admission. Even though some of the added material features non-Webb arrangements that pale in comparison (though Campbell meets the challenge of &quot;Highwayman&quot;), the whole thing reminds you of a time when genuine emotion still pervaded popular music. Some lovely stuff here.

review/text: &quot;Magic&quot; is a great thriller with big stars, and based on a novel by a popular author. For some reason, critics jeered it when it was first released, and it apparently dropped off the face of the earth. As a last resort, I bought this tape, but found the viewing conditions were very bad. It's better than nothing, I guess, but the sex scene was edited and the language dubbed out, just like on television! This particularly hurts the final line of the film, which includes a certain four-letter word. Nonetheless, it's a disturbing and very funny thriller with great performances. Buy this video anyway, it may be your last chance to see this movie, ever.

review/text: &quot;Run, Lola, Run,&quot; starring Franka Potente as the flaming redhead Lola, is guaranteed classic cult film status for years to come. Lola lights up the screen in this German film which features creative cinematography and near-perfect editing, combining cinema verit&eacute; and animation. Tom Tykwer shows brilliance as the film's director; his use of close-ups of these not-perfect faces is exceptional. &quot;Lola&quot; is a film that one can enjoy watching over and over again, so it is a worthwhile addition to a DVD collection. As someone who primarily enjoys classical music and opera, I was thrilled by the techno-trance music of the film's soundtrack. I recommend that viewers watch this film in the German version, with the English subtitles, because it is very easy to understand the film this way and adds to its authenticity. And it only gets better. The movie is told in three segments, each with different aspects and outcomes. Overall, this is definitely one of those films that gets better each time you watch it, a totally original, undiscovered treasure.

review/text: As a member of a public school board of education, one thing I look for is parental involvement. I like to see large crowds at school board meetings. This book is a valuable guide for parents of children up to 8th grade. Bennett stresses parental involvement. Parents should get to know their childrens' teachers and inquire about the content of the curriculum. Much of the book sets forth what children should learn in each subject area in each grade level. I found the chapter on social studies particularly interesting because that is the subject area where &quot;multiculturalism&quot; and revisionism can most water down the curriculum. Clearly, we should not white wash warts in our past, but we should teach history in a positive manner, while recognizing that no culture, including ours, has a perfect past. We should teach our commonality as citizens without over empahsizing our differences. Parents should know what is being taught in schools and, where children are not being taught what children should know, the parents should be active in correcting the matter.Bennett points out that the home, as well as the school, should be a center of learning. He gives examples of activities that parents can do with children to increase their learning. He also discusses dealing with difficulties that may arise in schools, such as disciplinary problems, etc. This book also discusses innovative and controversial issues such as charter schools, home schooling, how religion should be addressed in our schools, etc. I highly recommend this book and hope that it will spur parents on to close involvemet with their children's education.

review/text: From having him grow up a Manhattan gangster to including false photos the author shows an astonishing lack of historical research, especially for a man who has supposedly "spent more than thirty-five years studying the life and times of Billy the Kid." Included is just about every myth ever made up about the Kid with a few new ones thrown in. His sources? Most of these stories don't list any which is funny considering how many professionals have written biographies on him without reporting these. The sources he does list seem pretty disreputable too. He blatantly dismisses the accounts of the people who knew him. There is one page where he lists five accounts of Billy as a boy told by people who knew him and dismisses them all as biased. Not one subject agrees with him except, apparently, the ones who were never interviewed and can't refute him.His evidence that Billy stayed in New York City until he was fourteen and even committed a crime there is based entirely on the ill-kept census records of the time. There were thousands of McCarty's throughout the country and proving one of them to be the Kid is by now impossible. (Astonishingly enough he uses that same argument to prove that it couldn't possibly be the right McCarty family listed in Indianapolis as is the accepted history) He even has to change his and his mother's name to make it better fit his theory having her die before the record has her show up in Silver City.Based upon this flimsy evidence he makes up a complete back-story. He even has him travel all the way back to New York from New Mexico simply so that he can tie him in with a murder there before rushing back to New Mexico again. Again it requires major stretching of the dates and a name change to attribute this to the Kid. If Billy had ever gone by the name of Michael, been 3-4 years older, worked as a tinsmith at any point, and never left New York City then this might seem a more plausible theory. All the newspaper article says is that Michael McCarty aged 20 killed a friend with a knife. No further proof that it is the same person as Billy is listed nor even exists. As he himself states, McCarty is not exactly an uncommon name.This whole book, while fascinating, seems more a work of fiction than of fact. I'd recommend it as that if it weren't so boring and confusingly written. No doubt to hide the lack of any real substance. A real shame.

review/text: Far from being a novel yet a bible in the context of human history, this book tells much to all man kind. Once you finish the book, you would realize you're always alone even if you're living in a metropolis.The book is a story of a family who has lived in Macondo for about hundred years. The family started with mischief, which prevailed the fate of the family. But the family and Macondo vanished from the Earth when a baby was born with a pig tail.Bible tells about God's love towards human being; the book tells about the life of people who were deserted from God. Bible says about the Judgement of man kind; the book says about the suffering of deserted people. Bible is the promise of the uncertain salavation and Second Advent of Christ; the book is the story about the fate of deserted people who should suffer solitude even after dying.If you couldn't help but feel lonely, this book tells you why.

review/text: I went into "Tess of the D'urbervilles" with full knowledge of the harsh fate waiting for Tess, but that knowledge still could not prepare me for how harrowing and painful that journey was for her, and the reader. The character of Tess is so moral, innocent, kind, and unselfish against the society that is anything but, that Hardy's message of fate and social hypocrisy reveals itself full force in the novel. Tess has a love for life and an optimism that takes the harshest and cruelest society to beat down, and that is heartbreaking to behold.I thought this was going to be a stuffy English novel, despite the fact I quite enjoy (most) Victorian novels I read. However, I discovered that Hardy's prose flows well and is even beautifully poetic. Some of the best lines come from Tess's mouth, showing that she is not only morally upright, but also smart and incredibly perceptive.Hardy has a great way with words; romantic scenes are intensely passionate, emotional letters drip with feeling, and narrations delve into the feelings and thoughts of the characters so that the reader can understand, pity, empathize and sympathize with them. Most surprising perhaps is Hardy's understanding of the female mind; I think he has developed Tess into a believable and realistic heroine, and he has many interesting things to say about the differences of the genders, especially during that time period."Tess of the D'urbervilles" is a gorgeous yet heart-breaking novel. Not only does it entertain with its poetic prose and social themes, the novel also opens one's mind to the hypocrisy of the times; hypocrisies that even now may still appear in the thoughts and actions of people in this "modern" society.

review/text: By far the best part of this book is its droll, ironic, facetious demolition of the cultural relativists turned deconstructionists. As Gellner observes, relativism is good for allowing people their choice of wallpaper, little more.I was disappointed that there was not more in this brief book on fundamentalist Islam, since it was advertised as having been written as half of a duplex along with an Islamic historian.My main critique of Postmodernism ... is that Gellner presents the reader with a kind of intellectual 3 card monte. Postmodernism on the left is 'bad,' fundamentalist religion on the right is 'bad,' ergo, the only card left standing, in the middle, his brand of Englightenment Fundamentalist Secularism (as he candidly calls it) must by the process of elimination be 'good.'But those 3 categories are numerically incomparable. There might be 50 thousand committed postmodernists in the world--insignificant. There might be 400 million EFS's in the world, western europe plus bicoastal university USA. There are probably 2-3 billion committed religious believers in the world. But folks in Gellner's and the postmodern microcosms snobbishly condescend to those poor beknighted refugees from the 13th century.Gellner's big mistake here is to equate all sincere religious belief with fundamentalism, a bad gaffe for a sociologist, who should at least be able to correctly report what a given community thinks, believes, etc., even if he doesn't agree. But most Christians I know, and I believe most Muslims, and Hindus, are post rationalist, not pre-rationalist. That is, we take the best of the enlightenment, dredge its many infirmities, and add the good to the already very good religious faith. Two superb examples of this would be Popes John Paul II and Benedict XVI, both of whom were highly degreed and intellectually acclaimed in the maw of the enlightenment, saw its positives, rejected its weaknesses, and blended the one with the other, to create a superior development (not change) to 21st century Catholicism.Gellner is to be praised for admitting that the 2 attempts at putting 100% pure enlightenment-ism into political action were train wrecks, the french and russian revolutions. He also admits that his enlightenment fundamentalist rationalist secularist religion probably could have only grown up on Judaeo-Christian soil. But the problem is, is that the EFRS religion has been living off the fumes of Christendom for centuries, cutting the limb on which it is sitting, and soon the cultural vacuum which is europe (and bicoastal USA) will be ripe for plucking by immigrants with a more muscular response than 'whatever.'

review/text: This album has been quite hard to get a hold of for a while, but here it is, remastered and featuring Howlin' Wolf backed by his powerful early-70s combo, the Wolf Gang, which included guitarists Hubert Sumlin and L.V. Williams, bassist Dave Myers, drummer extraordinaire Fred Below, legendary piano player Sunnyland Slim, and saxist Eddie Shaw.Wolf himself was in his early sixties at the time this recording was made, and starting to suffer from ill health, but he could still rise to his former heights when it came to winning over an audience.This album was originally issued on LP in 1972, and featured eight songs. Two excellent bonus tracks were added when it was re-released on CD, extending the running time to just under 65 minutes, and Wolf and his band sound thoroughly inspired all the way through. Howlin' Wolf doesn't perform any of his classic hits, but once you slip this disc into your CD player and turn up the volume you will hardly notice. These powerful live versions of songs like the driving "I Didn't Know", Big Bill Broonzy's "I Had A Dream" (in a thumping high-octane rendition), and the gritty "Don't Laugh At Me" are every bit as great as any Willie Dixon-penned R&B; hit.Opening with the eight-minute "When I Laid Down I Was Troubled", Wolf and the band swagger through one blues powerhouse after another, mostly mid-tempo numbers with a few slow grinds thrown in for good measure, like the supremely funky "The Big House". Wolf's vocal performance on that one is one of his best ever; he stretches out comfortably for over seven minutes, singing certain verses he likes two or three times as the band locks in with deadly authority. And the other bonus cut, "Mr Airplane Man", is Wolf working his one-riff voodoo for all it's worth, a swinging, soulful sax riff and a groove deep enough to get lost in.You won't find a tougher, more enjoyable live blues record anywhere. Muddy's Newport album is great, and so is John Lee Hooker's "Live At The Caf&eacute; Au Go Go (And Soledad Prison)", but this pulsating steam engine is live blues at its very best and grooviest. The sound is not truly stellar, in spite of the remastering, but once you turn it up and start rocking back and forth in your seat with your eyes closed, you won't care one bit.

review/text: This German film directed by Hermine Huntgeburth is like a comic spin on The Grifters but with an added sexual component. When one of the 3 petty criminals who wallet snatch using the blind man ploy is injured in a chase, a replacement is chosen from someone who had tried to steal from them and had failed. His punishment was to be stripped by the two gay male members of the team, which prefigures the sexual triangle that eventuates when both the father and his daughter are attracted to the new member. We know that when we are told the group's rule is no exchange of body fluids that it is said to be broken. Huntgeburth gets comic mileage out of who is the the aggressor in each relationship and the stolen moments of intimacy they have in fear of being discovered by the third party. The most refreshing touch is how the father (Gotz George) is established as being mean to his gay partner, yet he becomes foolish when faced with the attentions of a younger man, as if he cannot believe it possible, and the Shakespearian appearance of George emphasises him as a classically defined pathetic figure. George actually resembles a brunette and heavy-set Ralph Fiennes. The daughter probably has the least interesting role, but Felix Eitner as the boy demonstrates the bisexual trend of modern sexuality, the free sexual preference of European men, and the question of sex as duplicitious behaviour. When Eitner's pet snake is disposed of cruelly, Huntgeburth sets up an expectation for his own fate, with the snake as metaphor. The accordian music of Niki Reiser sets the tone with it's melancholy and suggestion of exotic mischief, and thankfully Huntgeburth's treatment lacks the concluding cruelty of the Stephen Frears title.

Now, concerts in blu-ray are the only live performance DVD's I buy. And when I learned that Porky Tree's "Anesthetize" was available on blu-ray, I couldn't wait to get my own copy. Eager with excitement, I popped the DVD in my player and was ready for greatness.THUD!!!I've got to say that I'm a bit disappointed in the quality. Especially after owning and watching Pat Metheny's "The Way Up" and Steve Vai's latest blu-ray offering. The bar has been raised and I expect more from a band like Porcupine Tree. Porcupine tree is one of the best bands around, if not the best prog band around today. The music on this DVD is outstanding. But I was hoping for more. The quality is merely okay and one must exit the performance to view the menu - a big negative, since it's common with the format.In spite of that, I'm looking forward to buying future PT releases on blu-ray and attending their live shows. Now, all you prog snobs, you can send me your hate mail beginning now :-) !

The characters all had a fresh start in season 4 after most of Agrestic burned down. There are some really funny subplots and big surprises along the way. Many times I found myself wondering what the hell Nancy was doing and how could this possibly turn out okay for her in the end? But that only added to the suspense and my enjoyment. My only true criticism was that Conrad and his family were not accounted for. I hope they make a comeback sometime in the future to stir things up!

review/text: The Rabbi's Cat is a wonderful book. I heard the author speak on NPR and got the book. The book is in the form of a comic strip, each box lovingly illustrated by the author. The pictures are wonderful, particularly of the cat. They are a joy to behold.Even better are the stories, anecdotes taken from the lives of the Jews in North Africa in the thirties. The stories are both very sad and hysterically funny. The cat has a sardonic turn of phrase that had me in stitches. Through the difficult medium of comics, the author has managed to capture the atmosphere of the time and place. Much of the book is given to musings about life, philosophy, love, God and so on. If you like a good discussion, you'll enjoy this book.Although the books can be enjoyed by non-Jews, I think if you don't know the basics of Judaism, you'll be missing the most vital part of the book. Of course, the book is so appropriate for the cat lover. The author clearly understands cats perfectly.

review/text: I love techno and have listened to it since it's onset in 1989 or 1990. This CD, however, has not aged well. In 1992 when this was released I tolerated it because there weren't many techno artists or CDs out there. Now I see that this CD is simply tiresome, crass garbage. Samples of Annie Lennox and Kate Bush are overused and abused and the only reason this drivel was played on the radio or in any club. I think this CD has been stuck under the backseat of my Volvo 244 since 1993. And it probably has gunk on it.

review/text: This better be the last Batman movie they ever make. Their have already been four Batman movies and now a fifth on when will Hollywood make something orginal. To me Batman is going out of style and nobody watches the cartoon show on the WB. Morgan Freeman is in this movie I think he is good actor. I saw previews advertised on TV it looks good but enough. A horses breathes fire in theis movie.

review/text: This one is really great, songs ranging from 5 seconds to 7 minutes (some I would more likely call sound effects). I would strongly suggest this to any Zelda fan, or Zelda music fan, or even any music fan at all! Here are some brief descriptions for you to see what some of the songs are like:Title Theme: The song at the beginning of the game, slow but very peacefull.Boss Battle: Wow, this one has you feeling the power of the boss you are facing, or has you feel like you are facing one! :)Zelda's Theme: I like this one quite a bit, also slow and peacefull.Goron City: This one is pretty good until a yelping noise joins in the song...Lost Woods: Fast and entergettic (sorry if I spelled that wrong), I never grow tired of this one.Temple of Time: I can't hear any insterments in this one, only eccoy voices. Has you feel like you are in an oversized cathedral.Windmill Hut: I call this song the Song of Storms, but you can find it in the Windmill hut. Pretty much feels like a rain storm!Nocturne of Shadow: Ok, I like this one alot, I mean a whole LOT!Gives you a creepy feeling, gotta love that! :)Last Battle: This one really fits perfectly as, the title says, the Last Battle. Feels powerful.End Credits: This is by far the longest track on the cd, running a little past 7 minutes. Great for credits, hey its great for anything! But it does seem like they stringed together some of the other song to make it... No big deal, still great.I hope this has helped you in your journey in buying this cd! I also give great thanks to Koji Kondo for making all this great music for the Zelda games. Bravo.

The short summaries of each United State Territory and State leaves you hungering to learn more about it. Little known facts, capitols, and more. The only thing I wished it had was color pictures.

review/text: This was not a very good movie. I had to sheepishly explain to my wife why we had just wasted two hours of our valuable time. I had read some reviews that indicated that this movie was actually worth watching.Nothing could be farther from the truth! This movie was dry and boring the entire way through. And the suprise twist? An alien encounter would have made more sense.And the ending... If a story has to finish with a paragraph explaining or expounding the ending, then there is definitely something wrong. Unless a story is a true story or added for humor, beware of movies that end with a paragraph on the screen. It means that even the writer didn't like the screenplay.The only redeeming factor in this movie is that you get to see Elizabeth Hurley's chest, albeit from the side only.Anybody want to buy a slightly used copy?

There's too much sex in the book for my taste (nearly every 20 pages!), and the author presents an overly pessimistic view of humanity, as most of the characters are driven by sex, food, and egocentrism. It was an interesting read, but I wouldn't read it again.

If we (people of the world) or let's just start with the U.S., weren't so thick-headed, I believe we could achieve this. A great read for those who don't want to continue on the same catastrophic path of we've been walking for the past hundreds of years. It can start with the present generation. Remember, whether you believe in a higher power than humans or not, we do have brains and have implemented far more complex notions.

He also offers a valid critique of how the US govt was misguided in their approach to the Indian problem. Moreover, he pleads for the govt. to do something about those still in captivity. Fewer people might have gone West had they known what was really going on and the dangers ahead. This first-hand account is highly recommended.

review/text: This book is more of an insight into Mr. Golding's view of humanity than it is an insight into humanity itself. Needless to say, Mr. Golding has a very negative view of people. Perhaps his view is colored by the fact that he lived through the development and dropping of the atomic bombs on Japan (atomic bombs are brought up in the book as having hit the airport from where the boy's plane departed) and the rise of Nazism in Germany. Mr. Golding uses a group of plane wreaked boys to tell his tale of what he thinks is the natural denigration of society. Still, I can't find his view at all consistent with the world around us. If savagery was natural for people we would not have developed into a civilized society. In fact, with few exceptions, all peoples form structured societies that impart rules for the welfare of the group; not the other way around as Mr. Golding would have us believe. Except for few notable exceptions (like Nazi Germany) savagery is not natural for people. Even there, civilized peoples prevailed. Additionally, I believe this book has racist overtones in that Mr. Golding chooses to use the jungle motif to display his version of savagery. Why couldn't he use another back drop?Technically good writing gets the book three stars.

review/text: Someone's watching. The government has you entrenched in a conspiracy so deep, where a national tragedy gave leadership the opportunity to seize all of your rights in the name of your personal protection. No, this isn't the Patriot Act- it's "1984," a dystopian Science Fiction novel by George Orwell, the author of "Animal Farm." Written in 1949, "1984" hardly seems as dated as its title might imply. Really, nothing could be farther from the truth. The world set up by Orwell, over seen by Big Brother and his invisible band of Thought Police, has people political prisoners within their own country. Winston, a worker in the Record Department of one of the three ministries (The Ministry of Truth, or Minitrue), finds his mind resisting the world he's given, not completely accepting the "news" he's given, as well as doubting his contentment. He enters into a relationship, finds himself contacted by an underground resistance, and comes to discover some of the more dangerous traits of the Party. Orwell's "1984" is an extremely well written political masterpiece, which traces societal trends in an innovative and pessimistic sort of way.From the beginning, Orwell introduces new touches of technology made from innovations in his time. Things such as telescreens (basically televisions with the capability to communicate with and spy on members of the outer party) and speakwrites (a microphone that transcribes dictations) give a modern sense to the novel, while keeping it somewhat futuristic, even in modern times. No extravagant inventions like space ships or teleporters are touched on, so there isn't a feeling of inaccuracy or over-optimism that seems to be common in more ambitious science fiction media. Honestly, I found myself wishing that something such as a speakwrite existed for homework assignments, or even writing this very review; however, I didn't get that overwhelming sense of "Yeah right, nothing like THAT existed in 1984" from the position of being here in 2007.Orwell brings out the political message of the novel most obviously by using the supposed revolutionary Goldstein's book. The chapters from Goldstein's book are inserted into 1984 as Winston reads them. Although these excerpts read something like stereo instructions or college dissertations, it really affirms the politics behind Orwell's writing. The three political bodies, or countries, in this novel consist of Oceania, Eurasia and East Asia. Oceania includes the United Kingdom, Eurasia includes the Soviet Union and Eastern Europe, and East Asia includes China and Japan. The fact that Orwell had the foresight to predict a lot of specific traits of world politics (such as the takeover of one party regimes in China) and the escalation of current world politics (such as the arms race and the containment policy against the Soviet Union) absolutely floored me. There were times when I was reading through sections of Goldstein's history where I simply had to put it down, because some of the events supposedly taking place in the fifties and sixties I had just learned about in my history class as taking place around then. That in and of itself is not only brilliant, but very powerful; just knowing that the book predicted some of the things that happened gives more credibility to the more radical things Orwell predicted. That's what's so strong about "1984;" there's this sense of "It could happen."SPOILER WARNINGS!Another strength of the novel was the relationship between Winston and Julia. Although I personally didn't like Julia - (she struck me as a very odd sort of a rebel who didn't even seem to know what she wanted) - her character was perfect for the novel. Her quirky unpredictability and her complete disregard for authority showed how even the most seemingly active Party members harbored deep reservations about the life they were living. Also, her somewhat shallow and lukewarm interest in politics was a good portrayal of the way people would begin to act after living under an oppressively totalitarian regime. It was admittedly strange to me how Winston was impressed by how many men Julia had managed to sleep with, but their relationship was still believable. Both of them had the fundamental desire to rebel against the system, and they channeled that towards sex. Fortunately, I couldn't personally relate to that, but it did represent a form of rebellion on Orwell's part against people who want to turn sex into a utility and take all of the pleasure out of it.The ending, however, was the most potent part of the novel. When Julia and Winston are caught and tortured, and Orwell describes the nightmarish ordeal Winston is put through, the reader really comes to understand how Winston develops. Throughout the entire novel, Winston's progression from a nervous rebel, to a carefree rebel, to a penitent traitor was perfectly delineated by Orwell. After Winston suffers through his torture and decries everything- his distaste for Big Brother, his suspicion of changing information, his mental rejection of double speak- he becomes just another guy. Another drone under Big Brother, a man who loves and follows Big Brother and works for Big Brother. At first, I admit I was disappointed. I kind of hoped for some sort of upset, a little sense of rebellion or even a feeling that something might have changed because of what Winston did. That lack of closure in that sense, however, was actually really good for the book though. It just shows how hopeless, how drone-like, how terrible an existence under a complete ruler can be, and how there really isn't any hope of the dystopian society changing after it has come in full swing. It really drove home that people should actively keep their most basic rights, and never let them slip away."1984" was one of the most contemporary feeling books I have ever read that was written before the 80's. It's well written, engaging, exciting and interesting, and provides intellectual fodder as well as personal enjoyment. There is suspense, love, and introspective thought, and the entire novel is building up towards the big twists on the end. Personally, I think "1984" is one of the best of its kind, and was a better political metaphor than Alduous Huxley's "Brave New World" or even Orwell's own "Animal Farm." However, you'll never be able to look at your government the same again- Big Brother is watching you.

review/text: Janet Jackson is a very talented women. I will give her that much...but she tries way to hard to be Madonna. Madonna did the whole tie me up thing before you, Janet, and it was obvious that you copied her. But it's all good. The show was great, and unlike Madonna (who sings NO old songs) Janet sang almost all of her greatest hits from the 80s which was awesome. She could have put some more color into the show...and gosh take off those black slacks. The dancer with the short bleached blonde hair was annoying to no extent but the other dancers were cool. The only problem with this concert, is that the transition from one song to the other is really awkward. She should have really thought out the order of each song much better than what she actually did. She should have opened with a hit song too, and done much more with Got 'til It's Gone. Buy this video, it's fun to watch....but lacks a lot of thought.

review/text: This is a review of The original Romeo and Juliet, not this specific edition.Romeo and Juliet by William Shakespeare. A book so rooted in popular culture that in all likelihood you knew the plot, the characters and the ending years before you picked it up, or if you were like me, were required to read it for educational reasons.I wonder if I really know what I'm getting into by criticizing this book. In all likelihood I'm going to get a wave of negative comments because of what I'm about to say. To badmouth The Bard is almost to badmouth literature itself, and I don't want to do that.Thomas Jefferson once said "I cannot live without books", If anything is true about me, it's that.But thats the thing, technically, RAJ isn't a book, it's a PLAY. This means that it relies on those playing the parts of it's characters to provide any and all emotional depth, without whom it feels completely deadpan and flat. Maybe I'm wrong, as I've yet to see a live performance, and would be interested in seeing on. Without seeing one, Its hard to find what the characters were trying to get across to one-another when each one is trying to be poetic and overly dramatic. you really have to dig to find for example, the phrase "I love you" in a five minute monologue.But this is just my opinion. Maybe I would have liked it if I hadn't been forced to read it in High school, if you do read of your own free will, judge it after you've finished it, not because of what the back cover says.

review/text: The original heartbreaking Hollywood romantic drama, "A Star is Born" makes its debut on Blu-ray.While many people are familiar with George Cukor's 1954 classic film adaptation starring Judy Garland and James Mason, the very first film was back in 1937 and was produced by David O. Selznick (the producer known for "Gone with the Wind" and bringing Alfred Hitchock to the United States to direct "Rebecca" and "Spellbound") and a film directed by William A. Wellman ("Wings", "Nothing Sacred"). The film was written by Wellman, Robert Carson, Dorothy Parker and Alan Campbell.The film would star Janet Gaynor ("Seventh Heaven", "Sunrise: A Song of Two Humans", "Street Angel", "Lucky Star"), Fredric March ("The Best Year of Our Lives", "Nothing Sacred", "Design for Living") and Adolphe Menjou ("Paths of Glory", "A Farewell to Arms")."A Star is Born" was nominated for seven Academy Awards, winning "Best Story" (and also earning a special Academy Award for "Technicolor Cinematography" for W. Howard Greene) and would become the first color film to be nominated for "Best Picture".While there are earlier Hollywood films that would be based on one trying to make it in Hollywood or the perils of fame, "A Star is Born" would surprise audiences with its tragic ending and for a film of it's time, it was a a romantic drama that was an instant tearjerker.VIDEO:"A Star is Born" is presented in 1080p High Definition (1:33:1). It's one of the earlier Technicolor films and while this film has been released on DVD before, many who have seen this film, saw it via terrible quality public domain videos. May they have been downloaded or purchased on DVD.I have seen the original public domain version and because it was Technicolor and in bad quality, for me, those public domain versions were unwatchable. Fast forward to 2012 and Kino Lorber has presented us an authorized edition from the estate of David O. Selznick from the collection of George Eastman House.With that being said, for those who are not familiar with Kino Lorber, they are not like a major studio or the Criterion Collection. They do not do frame-by-frame restorations which is very expensive and laborious but they present the best quality of a film to present on Blu-ray. So, these are films that will have dust, white specks and damage. Kino Lorber is also selective on what releases will receive a Blu-ray release and with "A Star is Born", I'm pretty happy that they did choose this classic film and give it an HD release.As expected from early Technicolor films, the colors are a bit softer than what one are used to seeing from a Technicolor film from the '50s or '60s, but still, there is clarity. And compared to the public domain releases out there, this Blu-ray release of "A Star is Born" is a huge step via picture quality as colors are not faded. Sure, there is some film damage and white specks but the clarity, the colors and even the black levels look great for this 75-year-old film and its worth upgrading from the PD copies and even the previous DVD's to this Blu-ray release.AUDIO & SUBTITLES:"A Star is Born" is presented in Linear PCM 2.0 monaural and once again, Kino Lorber doesn't clean up their releases. They present the best quality of a film on Blu-ray.So, there are moments of mild hissing and occasional pops but by no means will this affect your viewing. Dialogue is clear, Max Steiner's music is also clear and definitely much more pleasant to the ears compared to the PD release.There are no subtitles.SPECIAL FEATURES:"A Star is Born" comes with the following special features:Gallery - Featuring 16 stills, posters and lobby cards.Wardrobe Test - (1:15) A Technicolor wardrobe test.Kino Classics TrailersJUDGMENT CALL:Before there was "Sunset Boulevard" and before the George Cukor classic starring Judy Garland, there was the 1937 William Wellman original.And while the 1954 film was quite memorable and also was a musical with a different storyline, "A Star Is Born" is rather interesting because it took on a storyline of what was happening in Hollywood at that time.Bare in mind, the transition from the silent era to the talkies, was the most difficult transition for many Hollywood talents. While many were well-known in silent films, many who transitioned to talking films, saw their careers decline. There was no gradual decline, one year you were hot, the next year your career was over.And it has been well-documented of the many Hollywood talents that were unable to transition their careers from the 1920's to the 1930's and became alcoholics.And while the classic film "Sunset Boulevard" featured that type of storyline focusing on a popular actress and her decline, in the 1930's, there were films that took on tabloid news about celebrity suicides and George Cukor (who directed the Judy Garland "A Star is Born"), directed a 1932 film titled "What Price is Hollywood?" that dealt with one's waning career (an interesting side note: David O. Selznick admitted that Cukor's 1932 film was used as source material for "A Star is Born").But with William Wellman's "A Star is Born" is your classic Hollywood story about a celebrity couple. Unlike the 1954 version which Judy Garland used as a vehicle to once again showcase her vocals, this is no musical. This is about two people who found love, but yet as one becomes a star, the other becomes a falling star and is unable to cope with his fall from stardom.And with the 1954 version, you expect Judy Garland to sing. With Janet Gaynor, what many have known her from is F.W. Murnau's "Sunrise: A Song of Two Humans", "7th Heaven" and "Lucky Star". Often she played the heartbroken woman, but for this film, she had a chance to show off various sides of her acting, may it be the tearful farmgirl who wants to go to Hollywood, the comedic actress trying to show off her acting impersonations to Hollywood higher-ups and most importantly, playing the strong-willed wife who has achieved success thanks to her husband.So, Gaynor was an intriguing actress to play the role of Vicki, because we see a different side to her acting.Fredric March on the other hand, he has always played the suave character. May it be his role in "Design for Living" to "Nothing Sacred", he is a charismatic actor and while his Norman Maine portrays him as strong-willed (this is a man who stays a man and never shows his sensitive side) man who is an alcoholic (strong-willed, but inside, he is frustrated and depressed).The original also was helped by its surrounding characters. May Robson does a fine job of playing the sensible grandmother (who actually has a wonderful supporting actress role in the film, a character missing in the 1954 version), Adolphe Menjou as the producer Oliver Niles and bumbling Andy Devine as Vicki's good friend, Danny.This is a film that focuses on the perils of fame and while I enjoyed this 1937 film for keeping within the confines of a Hollywood story without the "happily ever after", it's George Cukor's film that was full of emotion. Not to say that Janet Gaynor and Fredric March lacked emotion at all, it's acting that was common for 1930's, Judy Garland and James Mason took the role to another level in the 1954 film adaptation. There is no doubt that the musical version was emotionally charged and was much more of an emotional film.While both films are similar, yet they were very different and needless to say, George Cukor knew how to make the remake even more powerful and emotional than the original film.Still, for any cinema fan, a chance to see Janet Gaynor in her Academy Award "Best Actress" nominated performance and to see her in a much different light than she was previously seen in the Murnau films (and also to see her in early Technicolor) was quite enjoyable. Also, if musicals are not your thing and has pushed you away from watching the 1954 version, fortunately in 2012, we have the best version of the original "A Star is Born" on video ala Blu-ray. You can trash those public domain versions or give them away to a friend, but if you want the definitive version of this 1937 film, this Blu-ray release is the way to go!Granted, the picture and audio quality may not be pristine but still, this Blu-ray release is so much better than the old public domain copies and the film has never looked so good until now!Overall, "A Star is Born" is another wonderful release from Kino Lorber and a fine addition to their Kino Classics lineup on Blu-ray. I look forward to more of these classic Hollywood films from Kino! Definitely recommended!

review/text: The book is written about an empire in the future. I'm not really sure why Asimov thought that the future galaxy would be ruled by an emporer, which is a dying system of government, instead of a democratic republic. I know this is nit-picking, but I didn't like this book.Apparently, the future can be predicted with a high degree of accuracy using math and statistics. Anyone who works as a mathematician or statistician, as I do, knows that it's difficult to predict what's going to happen in anyone's life tomorrow, much less the entire world 500 to 1000 years into the future using statistics.This book is intellectual worship, which is something I can't stand. Intellectual worship is when people think they are intellecually superior to everyone else, so feel they should rule over everyone else, if only you would listen to them. This idea drips off the page as event after event is predicted by some really smart dude. This smart dude predicted a collapse of civilization and treated it as inevitable. Another idea that's patently absurd- that any event that occurs is inevitable.If this guy was so smart as to predict, with a high degree of accuracy, the downfall of civilization, and the rising of a new one, along with the traumatic events this new civilization would go through, why wasn't he smart enough to avert the downfall of the original civilization. Surely, with his predictive ability people would listen to him, but he decides to let it crumble for whatever reason.And Asimov is a mediocre writer. The story is only moderately interesting because no character really gets developed. I read this book because as a sci-fi fan, I felt obligated.

review/text: Forgettable horror thriller that has Keanu Reeves remaking his matrix role for an even less talented director and an even worse screenplay. Keanu's performance is a worthy effort but is not very good and he's more distracting than compelling in his role. His costar Rachel Weisz does much, much more than he does in the acting department and almost redeems the entire movie with her stellar performance but she's literally the only actor who tries to be better than the horrible script that they had to work with. A script that lacks not only common sense but a sense of purpose as well. The direction is shoddy with really bad camera work in all directions and the special effects don't hold much significance.Other than a worthy and game effort on Rachel Weisz's part. The movie is not worthy of her talent or your time.

The piano sounds fine, however. I suspect that there was a lot of spotlighting with the microphone placement, and that the violins were recorded too closely. Other recordings I have of various Mozart piano concertos are with Brendel/Marriner, Brendel/Mackerras, O'Conor/Mackerras, Uchida/Tate, Schiff/Vegh. I consider them all the be very fine performances. As far as sound goes, the Goode/Orpheus and Uchida/Tate are my least favorite recordings. The playing by the Orpheus CO is top notch.

review/text: I must agree with the other reviewer that this book offers no additional eye-opening facts in respect to owning a Burmese cat... The history section is specific to the breed (but as a new or existing Burmese owner, you'd probably already know this prior to getting one!) & there is one blurb regarding the Burmese characteristic to yowl when they require attention. Beyond that this book could really be for any other cat out there (feed your cat, give it water, groom it,...). It didn't even specify normal size/weight ranges for the breed and what quantities of food to give them as a guideline. So, in my opinion, useless to a new Burmese owner. Also, I was a bit disappointed that all of the photos are only of Sable & Chocolate Burmese (they are all gorgeous, but a few photos of Blues or Lilacs would be appreciated). All in all this book was disappointing.

review/text: I waited for this movie to come out and was disappointed with it. It is a fair story with many Hollywood history mistakes. Not all German planes were red, not all German planes were Fokker Triplanes (only around 300 made) they had a short run because of manufacturing problems, wings would come apart in a dive. The real airplanes of that time could not do half of the aerobatics that they show in the movie, they also would self destruct from G forces. They were mainly wood and fabric. They had 2 lions (whiskey & soda) not just one. There was a black pilot, but he came in late in the war and only had 1 and possibly 2 confirmed kills. I am now waiting for the new movie "The Red Baron" that was made in Germany and will be released on May 10th in Europe. It at least looks very accurate compared to the garbage that they put into The Flyboys. The movie is fair, but I would not go out of my way to purchase it if I new of all the historical mistakes in it. The producers even state they changed a lot of facts so that the average person would find it entertaining and not get confused at who was the bad guys. (Germans in red airplanes, "Red Baron")

review/text: I have just finished reading this story, which was the very first Philo Vance mystery for me to encounter. The book was full of dull and rather pointless (at least to the plot of the story) information about Chinese ceramics and dog breeding. Vance's ramblings made it very difficult for me to get into the book, and I found myself sympathizing with Marcum and others when they were fuming over his endless and dull speeches. But I persevered and kept on reading, sure that all this would pay off to a wonderfully clever ending. And I do admit, that trick with the door lock was wonderful! But other than that, the ending was unsatisfactory and disappointing. I do not wish to spoil the story, but what happened to the dead body after it had been initially attacked? Oh, come on! I know that it could actually happen, but please, to bring that unusual an element into the conlusion of a mystery is just plain anticlimactic, though I understand the author's intention of surprising his readers.Overall, the events of the story are not very well arranged, and although the events do come together at the end, it was not in a very satisfactory manner.

review/text: If you're tired of the "who can conduct Parsifal most slowly" contest, this is a wonderful recording. Makes the opera sound like a dramatic fifth opera of the Ring rather than a infinitely lugubrious funeral. Orchestral balance wonderfully modulated, very, very good cast. Highly recommended.

review/text: This is a totally enjoyable and recommended book. My only problem is that the author as a National Park System ranger does so many dangerous things that cannot be condoned. Please do not follow his example. It is very dangerous to do the following, as he did.1. Hike through the desert without a supply of water. 2. Climb a 13,000 foot peak alone with no one to go for help if needed. 3. Sliding down a 2,000 foot snow slide without proper equipment. 4. Rafting down the Colorado River without a life vest. 5. Descending alone down a canyon for a short cut and getting stuck in a deadly position, with no way to get help. 6. Hiking many places off of established trails all alone. 7. Hiking so far that it requires a more dangerous return in the dark of night. 8. Starting wild fires due to carelessness with pipe smoking. 9. Trying to capture a wild horse all alone and getting run over. This was done while all alone with no possibility of getting help if injured. 10. Drinking water from any available creek, pond or seep. Western water is now dangerous to drink in all western national parks. Treatment is necessary. 11. Eating five eggs and half a pound of bacon for breakfast. Is this the reason he died so young?Many tourists may read this book and follow his bad examples. I wish that he had given more words of caution. Follow the advice of more knowledgeable park rangers. Enjoy this wonderful book but be careful.

review/text: This CD is great for those who don't wish to pay over twice as much for the full OSV. Not only does it include most of the best tracks from Chrono Trigger, but it also features most of the arranged tracks from the PlayStation remake of the game. The only possible downside is that it has rather sparse liner notes (a mere few paragraphs of interviews), but the great selection more than makes up for this.

review/text: Any sports enthusiasts who owned a Dreamcast will remember Sega's NHL 2K series which began with the lackluster NHL 2K, and ended with NHL 2K2 (the last Dreamcast game) which re-defined the way video game hockey should be. Developer Visual Cocnepts went for the most realistic feel of the NHL they could go for, and came up with the most realistic playing hockey video game to date. Now, enter NHL 2K3: the series debut on all home systems. The feel of the game is as real as ever: the goalies are stingy and so is the defense (you will fight to get a shot off), the user options are incredibly deep (you'll never see a line manager option like this again), and the game is instantly replayable. You can set up on the fly strategy and play changes while your playing, and your team mates act and respond well and help set up the plays. Let me say now that this is no "let's go score ten goals in the first period and win every game in the season" type NHL game, the only thing more real is lacing up the skates and getting on the ice. Graphics wise the players move near realistically, and the animation is mostly smooth but some glitches can become apparent now and then. The crowd is just as it was in NHL 2K2; so-so. Controls eventually become second nature once you play the game for a while and discover all it has to offer. All in all, despite the ESPN gimmick, NHL 2K3 is the best hockey video game available right now, and it blows EA's NHL 2003 out of the water.

review/text: For all of those who didn't like this soundtrack or who didn't give it a full five stars for its quality, I'm writing this review. Let me just say that a true lover of &quot;classical&quot; or movie music should truly enjoy this soundtrack all by itself; and for those who are not only among that order but who've had these tunes running in their head for years ever since they first played the game itself, this is a must-have item. Upon first hearing the orchestral versions of these songs via Napster MP3, I was blown away: Those beautiful layers of mellow strings and dazzling piano and every other orchestral instrument make it all worthwhile. It's simply a more refined and mature interpretation of the music that's just fantastic to hear. One might say it's almost like turning your favorite pop into a beautifully blended wine. My one favorite song had originally been the Aria, but sadly, the reworked &quot;Kefka&quot; was just plain gorgeous; the two are now in close competition. I only wish the lot of you could preview the music on the website through RealAudio to judge for yourself more precisely. Apparently, it's not popular enough for that! Needless to say, get this soundtrack if you don't have it already: it's worth it.

review/text: This movie, The Odyssey, was a wonderful movie. The main character was Odysseus. He was played by Armand Assante. His wife was Penelope, played as Greta Scacchi. It started out in 1300 B.C. The movie started out with his son, Telemachus, played as Alan Stenson. Then, Odysseus was sent out to fight in the Trojan War. The Greeks won. Before he left he told Penelope that she would have to promise him that if his son had grown a beard before he returned, then she must marry someone else. After ten years at the Trojan War, Odysseus and his men were headed back home to Ithica. Many different things happened to them on the way home. First of all, the God of the Wind, Aeolis, gives Odysseus bags of wind. A curious guy on the boat named Anticlus, played as William Houston, let out all the bad winds. The boat switched and headed another way. Hermes, the messenger god, told Odysseus and his men that the witch needed them. Hermes gave Odysseus leaves to eat to keep the curse away. Odysseus climbed the mountains to the castle of Circe. She turned Odysseus men to animals. She(Circe) fell in love with Odysseus. She made him sleep with her, and it ends up he stays there for five years. After that, they got into their boat, and rode it into the Underworld. He sees his mother in the Underworld. In the Underworld, he went to see the blind phrophet. The phrophet tells Odysseus that he will fo fight two bad creatures, the Silla and the Curiptus. They meet up with Silla(mythological creature). It had several heads. It looked like a giant worm with heads and teeth. The Curiptus had a big mouth. The Curiptus shut its mouth and spewed water on everyone. Odysseus fell into the water. Back home, Penelope, was making a death shawl just in case Odysseus didn't come back. Her idea was to thread all day, and take it back out at night time. Then, it would be longer before he would have to choose another man to marry. Then, Odysseus ended up at some sort of place in the middle of the ocean. The lady, Calypso, played as Vanessa Williams. She kept him there for two more years, but then she was sad, because she had to let him go. He headed back home to Ithica. On the way, Odysseus met up with Poseidon, God of Sea. He(Poseidon) had been trying to teach Odysseus a lesson. Poseidon told him that if it wasn't for gods or goddesses, then humans wouldn't be here. Back home, Penelope and Odysseus mother were sqeezing olives to make olive oil. Finally,Odysseus makes it back home to Ithica. A lady there turns him to look like an older guy. Only his son, Tiresias, could recognize him. The men waiting for Penelope's hand in marriage were getting ready to find out who her next husband was. Odysseus sat back watching. The men had to shoot an arrow through twelve hoops. No one could do it except Odsseus. Then, all of a sudden Odysseus stepped u and shot the arrow through all twelve of the hoops. He turned back into his old self again. He killed all of those men. Odysseus and his family lived happily ever after. In this movie, my favorite character was Calypso played as Vanessa Williams. She played it really good. I felt sorry for her, because she had to let Odysseus go back home to Ithica.

review/text: I traded it away this morning and there is this great sense of calm in my soul. You see, Revenge was maybe my favorite 360 game. Maybe my favorite racer ever. It was near perfect. Not realistic, but who wants that? Each race was beautiful chaos. That's the problem here. Risk no longer equals reward. Burnout Paradise is the Alien 3 of this series.The most frustrating aspect of this game is you're better off playing it safe to really pushing the envelope. Because, unless you memorize every inch of the CITY (not track like the previous game, here there is no track), you're doomed to catch some pointless extention to a guard rail here, a side mirror on a parked car there, etc. trying to avoid a non-combative car in your way that you no longer can rear end and use as a pinball physics weapon on the other drivers. Nope, here everything is death. Now I'm pro death and like hard games, but the best offense in this game isn't mayhem, it's Sunday driving. Casually drive around without turbo unless you're trying to force a car off the road. It terrible.Marked Man makes no sense because you can't actually LOSE the cars chasing you, they just pop up. So why go fast? Just drive carefully, it's not like time is a factor. Rampage? Again, the enemy cars don't get you 90% of the time, some random bystander does. So why go fast?Maybe that this game's greatest flaw. It's ironically repetitious. The events all feel the same. The cars all feel the same. You just change cars as another time killer (drive to the junkyard) so that you have one that doesn't die on two hits or will spin around in a Stunt event. This formally was accomplished by selecting the car before the race as a menu. MUCH FUNNER! Thanks guys. Given, chasing down cars and crashing them to "earn" them between event is fun... but that's all you do. So again, boring fast and better when it was called Rampage with eight other cars.I like the Technical merits of this game and understand why they felt this was the "next step", which keeps me from giving it a 1. But this game should be a warning like Tony Hawk Underground and Shemue that walking/driving/skating from event to event is not in itself a good game. GTA was good because the mini-games were varied and the stealing/killing/rooming "menu" had it's own charms. Burnout does not for the most part.

review/text: A forward to this book written by Asimov himself makes reference to his publisher's wish that he write additional foundation novels, and implies that their incessant demands eventually overcame his own reluctance to do so. Almost as if he's saying to the reader, "Hey, don't blame me for this steaming pile. They made me do it."If I had Asimov's resume, I'd be reluctant to put my name on this book as well.As the title implies, Foundation and Earth is about the protagonists' continued search for the world of origin. Unfortunately, unlike Foundation's Edge, the journey itself is not long enough to fill the requisite 500 pages, so we're subjected to endless interludes of casual conversation between protagonists which are completely irrelevant to character or story progression. A simple question will launch a character into a tedious three-page monologue that reads more like an essay than dialogue.As other reviewers have said, the primary purpose of these later books was to tie each of Asimov's sci-fi series together into one universe. This works alright for the robots, but does more harm than good to the legacy of The Foundation.If you've read the original Foundation novels, It's likely that no negative review will dissuade you from reading this one. Therefore, I commiserate with you in advance.

review/text: Words fail. Inspiration overflows.There is a reason that so many musicians - and non-musicians - hold this album in awe to this day.In my own humble opinion, there simply are no recordings that approach this by anyone I have ever heard. The sheer power of this music overwhelms all who can hear something of what it says. It is from the soul, but not sloppily, not "free", not randomly. It is music by absolute masters at the absolute peak of their powers. They have been assembled by their musical and spiritual leader to give thanks directly to God - whatever form that may take - with nothing between them and that "audience." What they create, what they unleash, are 4 movements of overwhelming candor, of unrivaled expressiveness. The minor blues forms are deceptively simple, hypnotic at times, but these four are masters of the blues, and the Tower of Babel they assemble on that unshakable foundation succeeds in reaching the heavens.It almost trivializes the accomplishment of this recording to praise the stunning technical mastery on display by Coltrane, Tyner, Garrison, and Jones. Rhythms fly on and off the mainline, but remain unfailingly - and at times astonishingly - true to the time. Listen to Elvin's rim shots in the first movement, amid the blurring polyrythmic overlays.This is primal scream, prayer, and devotion by geniuses. It is Picasso's Guernica, Michelangelo's David. It is my first and only nominee for greatest American contribution to world culture.For those who can't hear it, don't blame the album. Try to listen and learn the language. If it continues to make you uncomfortable, then consider the possibility that things that reach your soul hit too close to home.

review/text: Christmas is coming, but Charlie Brown can't get into the Christmas spirit. Seems all the hustle and bustle leaves him feeling sad. Lucy suggests that he direct the Christmas play, but it doesn't seem to be helping. Can Charlie Brown find the real meaning of Christmas?This is an absolute holiday classic. I can remember watching this every year when it was on, and today it never fails to put me in the Christmas mood. It's really amazing how well this stands up, even though the animation is far from perfect and some of the references are out of date. (Aluminum trees anyone?) Still, for me, that's part of the charm. All the characters are true to their comic strip personalities, making for some very funny lines and moments.Also included on the DVD release is It's Christmas Time Again, Charlie Brown. This second special is an animated collection of some of the Christmas themed strips from the late 80's. There's no single story and it's not as charming as the first, but I enjoy it and its great moments. (&quot;Hockey Stick!&quot;)The DVD offers no extras beyond these two Christmas features, but the picture quality and sound are excellent.This DVD is a must for all Peanuts fans, but belongs in the library of anyone who enjoys Christmas specials so it can be enjoyed year after year.

review/text: The problem I see with people debating the merits of this game generally revolve around motivation. If your sole motive is to use this game just to play chess, you will only get a fraction of the value out of it and might even be disappointed with it. The multiplayer function, offline, requires two people to pass the controller back and forth. While this is not a problem with me, some tend to consider it a hindrance. There are not many people that play online, so the "live" feature lacks attractiveness. This leaves you basically with just a chess game that you are able to play on the xbox, but not much else. If you play the game in this fashion, you are really only getting a superficial taste of what this game really has to offer.If you, on the other hand, are a player that would like to develop his/her game significantly, then you will marvel at the extensive, nay, nearly overwhelming, tutorial features Chessmaster has to offer. This tutorial section, I believe, is the heart of the Chessmaster game. There is an "academy" taught by Josh Waitzkin himself. It is broken into sections covering the basics of movement, strategy, tactics, psychology, and endgame strategy. To show examples of each section, he annotates an incredible amount of games he played that reinforce the principles he is teaching. I have had this game for a week going through the academy and have not gotten through half of it. This academy is only a fraction of the tutorial section though. There are also the tutorials from previous Chessmaster installments, drills, and an infinite number(literally) of one move puzzles.There is so much depth to this Chessmaster game that I feel I have not really done it justice in the review. The Josh Waitzkin academy is worth the $20 dollars alone. If you are striving to become a better chess player and looking for some direction, I couldn't give this game a higher recommendation.

review/text: During my lifetime, I have always enjoyed playing video games and watching tv. I was a true couch potatoe, and barely left to go play with my friends. And the thing I hated most was reading. Any book, no matter how interesting, could't keep my attention, and didn't keep me reading. Language Arts was my least favorite class, becuase reading was so boaring at the time. When I moved to California ,I made a new friend named Tina. We both shared the intrest in video games, but she loved to read. Eventually, she told me about this book. I told her I loved cats, and read the prelouge. At first, I nodded it off, telling her that I'm not really into reading. But the next time I went over thier, I looked at the book again. It was like pulling me into it. It was the only book that caught my intrest. I kept reading, and pretty soon, it was the best book ever. It could make someone like Tina that hated cats before, love them. She even got 2 of them becuase of the books! When I was finished that book, my life changed. I started reading the rest of the series, and read the ones I've already read. When you read them, its like you're in another world. I, the one who hated books and never picked on up in my life, actually cried, laughed, and yelled positive and negative things about the characters in the book, like I was actually their. My language arts grade went up when I became one of the quickest and most observant readers in the class, and I even looked at my greenbelt, aware of the freedom it brings. This brought me outside, playing sports, and running around with friends. Every person that I suggest these books to read the first chapter, and can't stop! I assure you you will be satisfied, and even more! I read all kinds of books now, but nothing compares to the excitment, the saddness, and the love in Warriors: Into the Wild.BTW, I'm 13, so for all parents out their, my mother loves the books too. They're great for children, and their fall in love with the cats. But it's also great for teens and adults. Before hand, my mother would tell me something like, "Get off the couch, pick up a book, and read!" But now, my mom alwas says something like, "Get off the couch, put down the book, and go to bed!"

review/text: I had decided not to review my favorite studio recording of Parsifal because so many others had already said most of what I had to say. But after listening to the 2nd Act on my lunch hour today, I find I need to blow off some happy steam and share a few thoughts.Much for the same reason as Kubelik's "Meistersinger" was supressed to clear the market for Karajan's inferior recording, this Parsifal languished in the vault for more than twenty years. It is a great pity and shame that one conductor can wield that much power, to the detrement of his collegues, and the loss of the opera-loving public.Rafael Kubelik's flawlessly proportioned, profoundly felt reading of this most ephemeral of Wagner's operas equals the best of Knapperstbusch's live Bayreuth performances with all the advantages of a studio recording: the orchestra and choruses are exceptionally detailed and transparent without any loss of weight in the sound, so all inner voices can be clearly heard. This is especially effective in the Flower Maiden scene, where you get a more visceral sense of the numbers of bodies surrounding Parsifal, rather than a generic choral mass. Kubelik's sense of detail in dynamics and color is a real highlight of this set, and The Bavarian Radio Symphony, particularly their winds and brass, plays magnificently. In this recording, more than any other I've heard, they are the equal of the NY, Vienna and Berlin. He also understands that the voices in Wagner are part of the orchestra, or rather that the orchestra is often 'on top.' You will not have an unnatural prominence of the voice at the biggest climaxes, as is so often the case. The voices may very nearly be subsumed at times, but not entirely lost.Kubelik also has a clear vision of the overall architecture of each act. His sense of pace is generally faster that what we usually hear these days; Knapperstbusch could be very brisk when the spirit was on him; Fritz Busch, on Marston's issue of the 1936 Buenos Aires broadcast is even more manic at times. But when he opts for a slower than usual tempo, the effect is enthralling. Listen to Parsifals first description of his past to Gurnemanz ("Ich hab' eine Mutter"): the stately tempo reflects the majesty of the forest and the dramatic tension begins to increase. The same occurs in the 2nd act at "Ich sah' das Kind." Kundry's gentle, deliberate pace builds the tension released in Parsifal's grief. He also makes a point of combining changes of dynamics with shifts of timbre. This is remakably effective throughout the score and requires playing of the highest calibre. The emotional result is obvious at first hearing and never wears thin.Kurt Moll's superb Gurnemanz was recorded within months of his equally fine reading for Karajan. His vocal health is virtually the same, but there are many differences of interpretation and nuance. This is the mark of a great lieder singer, and great Wagner singers are usually great lieder singers, too. Here he makes wider use of pianissimo singing, especially in Act 3 scene 1; he barely whispers some lines, something he could never do in the theater, and the effect is tremendous.I am unapologetically a huge fan of James King's, and this is some of his best recorded work. He is an anomaly among Wagner tenors; a combination of italiante spinto squillo and a touch of gallic restraint. (He studied extensively with Martial Singher, perhaps the finest baritone France produced in the 20th century, and the eloquent Amfortas on that Buenos Aires broadcast, with his father-in-law holding the baton.) He is hardly unemotional, though he can tend toward a strictness with note values. But if you listen closely (with headphones), even his inhalations are in character, a rare and difficult thing. Only Jon Vickers compares in emotional inolvement, seemingly more so for his greater freedom and less brilliant tone. As is often the case, a phrase by phrase comparison of these two singers shows that they make pretty much the same emotional points, but the sheer opulence of King's sound tends to overwhelm the expressive gesture.Yvonne Minton again sings an impassioned and seductive Kundry, as she did on Armin Jordan's soundtrack to the Syberberg film. The edge in her upper range is a little more pronounced here than it was a few years earlier, but it helps put over Kundry's frantic desperation at the end of act two. She copes well with the role's notorious pitfalls and understands the character completely.Amfortas is sung here by Bernd Weikl, in peak voice. He is a very fine Amfortas, vocally luxurious in fact. He holds out the high G in act one for nearly the full measure, although Wagner only wrote an 1/8-note. He doesn't express the same depth of sorrow as Jose van Dam, or the searing torment of Thomas Stewart, but he surely belongs in that upper echelon.Franz Mazura's Klingsor is one of the best on records, too. He has the natural sound perfect for Wagner's villains, but doesn't rely on it alone. In addition to the native snarl he uses the words, particularly the consonants, to express his hatred and disdain of the Grail Knights.Titurel is sung magnificently by Matti Salminen, and this is a bit of a problem. Why did the engineers choose to place him up front and equal to Amfortas and the Knights when Wagner demands that the voice issue from the crypt? The effect of this scene is spoiled. But, as Jascha Heifetz said, "Only God is perfect."All of the small knight and squire parts are filled nicely. Lucia Popp again lends her ravishing soprano to the 1st Flower Maiden, and the rest of that ensemble is as good as you will hear. The Toelzer Knabenchor and Bavarian State Opera Chorus are magnificent in the Grail Temple scenes, which glow with spiritual intensity. The bells of Monsalvat, however, seem rather thin: more like cymbal and gong tacked together.The original early digital recording has been remastered to the latest 24bit/96kHz technology, and the sound isbrilliant and balanced throughout. My only misgiving (beside the perspective on Titurel) is a hint of room echo, but this is rarely noticable except with headphones.It isn't a problem at all in the interior scenes of the temple, where the Herkulessaal of the Munich Residenz has just enough echo to suggest the domed space of the Grail temple. But forest, garden and meadow sound a bit boxed in.Overall, this is the most satisfying studio performance of Parsifal I have heard.

review/text: I am a very visual person so I can sit through lots of meaningless despair as long as it photographed in beautiful settings with lots of lush costumes and fantastic architecture. This film has all of that. It helps that the cast is strong and rather attractive, too. It makes for a "good show."As for the content, well...I found the story interesting, told as it is, from the view point of the man who was deceived. First we see the splendid surface--the two wealthy couples, one American, one English, in a German spa, pre-World War I. They spend several years together, performing, as the narrator says, a "minuet." A lovely picture. Then the narrator lets us in to the story behind the story, almost as he has discovered it. From reading some of the reviews of the book, it seems that the narrator is much more befuddled than he is portrayed in the film. That may be a flaw in the translation of book to film...I don't know. As the layers of the characters peel away and we learn of the rotten-ness at the core of the apple (his words), the story intensifies, or as they used to say, "the plot thickens."My attention was held throughout, mostly by the strength of the actors and the visual splendors. The plot, itself, doesn't have much to offer modern audiences. We know about adultery, betrayal, revenge, hypocrasy. There is nothing here that illumines any of the characters, raises them up to a higher plane. No one changes, learns anything, grows, transcends his dire situation. Most of the players chose cowardly outs---three out of five chose suicide, and one descends into madness. So I wasn't left with a particularly satisfied feeling at the end.The main character, who is supposed to be the befuddled weakling, was played by the charming Robin Ellis, who I fell in love with in the tv series, "Poldark." That's probably what kept my interest--not a great reason. But he remains as befuddled at the end as he was in the beginning. So one could ask "What's the point of all this?" Perhaps Ford Maddox Ford was using this as a means to discover answers to his the riddles of his own life. Here he offers us questions but no answers.I suppose there is more value to the story if one were to read the novel, but having seen this, I don't think I'll bother. I give it four stars just for the splendid production. (It was really funny to see John Ratzenberger, Cliff Claven, the mail man in "Cheers," in a totally different setting.)

review/text: Very few directors come along that match the genius of Roman Polanski. I haven't much to say regarding this film, the plot is simple and does more than justice to Ira Levin's novella. John Cassavates and Mia Farrow are superb in this soul wrenching film that, unlike many horror movies, doens't scare you from it's bloody murder, but rather, it's psychogical trickery. Pay attention and listen carefully when watching this film for subtle hints and clues to the truth, they are easy to miss. A wholesome, psychological, subtle, mind boggling, horrificly frightening movie that was decades ahead of its time. FLAWLESS acting, stylistic subtle camera usage and score. Rosemary's Baby is BY FAR,unrivaled as the Horror Movie of ALL Horror Movies. Enjoy this one.

review/text: I first read Orwell's masterpiece for seventh grade summer reading in 1983 (got in right under the gun!). It remains one of the key books of my intellectual development. 1984 was the first book to get me to think about the importance of the freedom of the individual, the dangers of mob psychology and the evils of totalitarianism.Winston Smith is a member of the Party, as is everyone else who isn't a &quot;prole,&quot; and like everyone else, he lives &quot;from birth to death under the eye of the Thought Police.&quot; Orwell builds up a gray and chilling world where &quot;no emotion was pure, because everything was mixed up with fear and hatred.&quot;This is what Orwell imagined in 1949 would be the logical extension of communism. And look where we are, fully sixteen years after the year 1984, with the video camera technology that can do effectively the same thing as the Party's telescreens. Imagine life with a TV that could watch you while you watched it--a TV that could bellow at you to do your calisthenics in the morning or face arrest! That's what Big Brother is all about, the absolute lack of privacy to enforce the absolute conformity of action and thought--something to contemplate before tuning in one of those cheesy &quot;real-life&quot; TV-ratings-grabbers. In Orwell's 1984, there was nothing to laugh about.Orwell's writing style is intentionally as stark as the world he creates. The narrator does a lot of telling as well as showing, but this does not slow the pace. I heartily recommend 1984 for anyone over eleven who appreciates his or her freedom and individuality. You may appreciate it far more once you have finished this book.

review/text: I originally purchased this book when I became a competition team member for the trial advocacy program at my law school. When I thought about an objection that I could make, or that would be made against my case I turned to this book. I would turn to the objection or issue and there would be the relevant federal rule of evidence easily laid out and explained. Most beneficial is the explanation on not only how to MAKE the objection to the court but then how to properly RESPOND to the objection. This book is helpful as I would know how to properly make the argument to the judge/court. It was also helpful to read over/review the book and look at the objections to get an idea of if you could use something else in your case. At the end of the book it also has the complete federal rules of evidence. I can't say more amazing things about this book, BUY IT BUY IT BUY IT!

review/text: CASUALTIES OF WAR(USA - 1989)Aspect ratio: 2.39:1 (Panavision)Theatrical soundtrack: 6-track Dolby StereoDuring a routine field trip at the height of the Vietnam War, a young soldier (Michael J. Fox) rebels against his commanding officer (Sean Penn) and other members of his patrol when they kidnap a defenceless Vietnamese girl (Thuy Thu Le) and subject her to a terrifying physical ordeal.Unfairly overshadowed by the simultaneous theatrical release of Oliver Stone's pompous (but still impressive) BORN ON THE FOURTH OF JULY (1989), Brian DePalma's CASUALTIES OF WAR recreates a harrowing incident from the Vietnam conflict - first reported in 'New Yorker' magazine in 1969 - in which a group of otherwise decent men succumbed to their own worst impulses and committed a terrible crime. Filmed with typical cinematic bravado by master craftsman DePalma, the movie uses every inch of the scope frame to convey both the duality of the landscape (vast swathes of breathtaking countryside, where sudden death lurks around every corner) and the moral vacuum which stretches the two central characters (Fox and Penn) to breaking point.Crafted with blistering simplicity by screenwriter David Rabe (himself a Vietnam veteran and author of the acclaimed stageplay 'Streamers'), the soldiers are depicted as brave individuals whose principles have been shattered by their traumatic combat experiences, leaving Fox to essay the role of peacemaker in a world where all the rules have been turned upside down. Thu Le - a model with no prior acting experience - is truly heartbreaking as the soldiers' terrified prisoner, and her ultimate fate is so horrific (arguably the most disturbing set-piece of this director's entire career), many viewers will be too appalled to see the film through to its inevitable conclusion. All in all, this uncompromising gaze into the abyss of human depravity packs a tremendous emotional wallop, and emerges as one of DePalma's strongest films to date.

review/text: I viewed this book mainly as a pleasant romantic novel. But I found that the main character Winston was very arrogant and shallow though Orwell made sure that the character was very believable. Generally a very well thought out book, though some areas, such as when he is taken by the thought police are very simple and obvious and lacking in imagination. Anybody could have written that section, it lacked originality.However, I thought that the system of government was very well organised and well thought out and seems like an efficient and effective method of ruling. Although, very harsh and unfair and not something you would like to see in practise. Cold and harsh but effective.In conclusion a very romantic story that was upsetting in places. I cried when Julia was captured.

All humanness is removed through war, poverty, suffering, and torture to make the population zombie like and easy to manipulate. The language is changed and all records, books, etc are abolished.

review/text: Upon reading this incredible book again, I realized that this book is timeless. It has a style that does not require a reader to know anything about comics prior to reading this book. If you are looking to get a young person into comics this is an excellent way to start. Jim Starlin is in rare form and paints an excellent picture of angst and despair, and finally joy and astonishment. The book shows you the majestic quality of the Marvel heroes, and their epic struggle to safe guard their world against even the most impossible odds. This book displays the greatest show of courage and strength ever seen in comics. As the reader, you are given a chance to cheer, cry, and stand in total awe of all the visual magnificence dilivered in rare form by both George Perez (The Teen Titans, Avengers) and Ron Lim (X-Men 2099, Mutant X). If you want to see Marvel at its best, The Infinity Gaunlet is the best possible example.

review/text: The book is brilliantly written as long as it concerns itself with Orual's passionate indictment of the gods. It loses its power, however, when Lewis falls prey to his tendency to preach. Part 2 undermines the rest of the book first by telling the reader what to think and then by couching the lessons in an implicitly Christian moral context. In this way, it is reminiscent of &quot;The Last Battle,&quot; a coda which mars the otherwise enjoyable &quot;Chronicles of Narnia.&quot;

review/text: Recordings has this interesting habit of containing works of composers of different periods of their careers. Is that a good thing? Indeed, since it's fascinating of how much the composer's music change in terms of idiom, communication, maturity, &amp; so forth as the years passed by.Boris Nikoleyevich Lyatoshynsky (1895-1968) had written his first symphony by 1919 whereas the symphonic ballad, Grazhyna, was completed by 1955. The symphony, in three movements, is a work having traceable influences of both Gliere &amp; Scriabin, with a hint of Wagner &amp; Rachmaninoff. It's a youthful yet a daring work, with the outer movements having virtually no restraints as far as expressionism is concerned. Whereas the 1st &amp; 3rd movements are dramatic, powerful, &amp; heroic, the 2nd movement is mournful, beautiful, yet mystic. It is where one notices Gliere's &amp; Scriabin's influence more readily. Nevertheless, the symphony is refreshing, &amp; served as a very important step for Lyatoshynsky in finding his voice, &amp; the voice of the Ukraine. In fact, Lyatoshynsky's first symphony is generally regarded as the first Ukrainian symphony as a matter of importance in the development of Ukrainian music.Grazhyna was composed in commemoration of the centenary of the death of Adam Mickiewicz, a great Polish poet. Lyatoshynsky was very fond of Polish culture &amp; heritage, &amp; has attended many of it's cultural events. The symphonic ballad begins &amp; ends in a similar fashion to Rachmaninoff's Symphonic Poem &quot;Prince Rostislav&quot;: mystic, mournful, very quiet, muted strings, with theme played by the woodwind (the cor anglais in Grazhnya). The work picks up the pace, with drama &amp; heroics dominating the work until a funeral march sets in. Unlike the first symphony, Grazhyna is somewhat more restraint &amp; mature, but no less appealing. It's a work of substance &amp; heartfelt homage to the Poet instrumental in shaping the culture of Poland.The performances of Theodore Kuchar &amp; the Ukrainian State Symphony Orchestra (now the Ukrainian National Orchestra) were blistering, highly passionate &amp; sonorous (more so than the one with Gnadesh conducting the same emsemble, with the recording re-issued by Russian Disc). The recording is perfect.Recommendable to the upmost!!!

review/text: This is a grotesque despoliation of a classic film. Essential elements of the background storyline are not properly established. There are scenes whose purpose within the overall structure simply defies understanding. The nighttime 'escape attempt' sequence is shot in a bizarre green blur and was extremely unpleasant to watch. Hideous music plays frequently but the nail in the coffin of this film is the poverty of the in-game action sequences. These are generally nothing more than a confusing melange of images. The transitions from one camera shot to another seem very poorly done and it is really impossible to follow the internal dynamics of each game.

review/text: Once again, David Gemmell leads us into the harsh yet fantastic world of the Drenai. The book is "Winter Warriors," and it showcases Gemmell's steadfast refusal to try to fix something that just isn't broken. If you're familiar with previous Drenai novels, the themes should be familiar - three old soldiers (a master swordsman with a tragic past, a bowman whose eyes are failing him, and a hulking brute with more heart than brains) find themselves embroiled in a quest to save Queen Axiana and her unborn son from the hordes of demons who seek them out. If the unborn king is sacrificed... yep, you guessed it, the world enters an age of unending darkness, and all mankind will suffer.It's true, you could fault Gemmell's cast of characters for being too archetypical, and bearing more than a passing resemblance to previous characters in the Drenai series (compare Nogusta of "Winter Warriors" to Chareos in "Quest For Lost Heroes," or Bison to Beltzer in the aforementioned tome)... but be that as it may, each and every principle character in "Winter Warriors" is a living, breathing, flesh-and-blood human being, and few fantasy authors can achieve such a claim. Each man and woman behaves in a realistic, believable fashion, and comes out of the adventure dramatically changed by the experience. In an attempt to wow you with magical doo-dads, action set pieces, and enigmatic creatures, most fantasy authors forget to inject humanity into their work - but not David Gemmell. "Winter Warriors" is a deeply human story, no matter what demons or magical spells come into play. The action works because you genuinely care about the people fighting for their lives... and if you know David Gemmell, you know too that no hero is immortal.I can find few faults in "Winter Warriors," to be quite honest. Granted, the premise is not very original, and the plot sometimes gets a little bit convoluted. Yes, "Winter Warriors" mimics the same themes of previous Drenai books (see "Legend" and "Quest For Lost Heroes," to name but a few), but I'm not sure that qualifies as a fault. It's very moving, inspirational stuff packed with at least as much drama as action. I just don't get tired of desperate men, underdogs by all accounts, standing up for what they believe in against seemingly insurmountable odds in the David Gemmell vein. If more of us lived our lives like Nogusta, Chareos, or Druss the Legend, I think this world would be a better place. Can I truly pay Mr. Gemmell a higher compliment than that?

review/text: First, I wish nobody to need the information about IBD. But, for one who needs it, the current book is not a best place to look for.Obviously, the author's attempts to explain little bit of everything worked, and almost every reader would find in the book something related to his or her case. The problem is that it is so little of information in each topic, that almost nobody would find it really helpful.The author did a pretty good job by collecting people's letters, which could help ones who need to know that they are not alone. Still, news groups, which could be easily found in the web would work much better.And the last, most important: the author is a typical example of conventional medicine approach. If you trust in convention medicine and your doctor, you don't need any book at all - your case is going to make to your doctor so much money, that he or she would be happy to provide you the details (unless of course you'll ask for the cure of the disease). And, if you want to try alternative ways, you would not find any help here, just a couple of standard words, which every conventional doctor would say to you in case you would ask.

review/text: Really, I don't think Cat Among Pigeons is considered one of Agatha Christie's best works. How can it be? The story starts very slowly, with no real narrative hooks in the plot at all. There are superficial facts about characters in the book that really don't affect the story at all. It just fill up pages. Then, the murder of the gamesmistress is discovered near the middle of the book, which I think is another mistake. How can you expect the reader to keep on reading when they figure out that the actual murder is a long time coming? Then, the famous Hercule Poirot (who is the only reason that I read this book) is introduced very lately into the book.I think another reason that I really didn't like this book was because there are so little suspects in the book. I mean, you can right off the bat count off numerous people. Plus, there are many who were incapable of actually commiting the main murder, and this also eliminates many but a few.All in all, I was disappointed by Cat Among the Pigeons. If you are looking for a real Hercule Poirot thriller, look for Murder on the Orient Express or The Murder of Roger Ackroyd.

review/text: With the new hard drive based MP3 players, I wanted to rip all my CDs (about 200) and put it on a player. This meant one with at least 20GB. I decided to rip at 224Kbps for higher quality. I ended up using 16GB for 2229 Tracks from 225 Albums. To give myself more head room I decided that 40Gb should be my choice.Some of the features out there...*Hard Drive - Definitely needed this to rip all my CDs to MP3.*FM tuner - This was a nice to have...so, I wasn't disappointed that this doesn't have it*Voice Recorder - This is also a nice to have....so, I wasn't disappointed that this doesn't have it*Line in to record - This is also a nice to have....so, I wasn't disappointed that this doesn't have it*Use as a hard drive - I really wanted to have this, but as you'll see below, I kind of didn't get it.So, everyone's question is why didn't I get the iPOD? It's definitely the coolest. I played with one a little at a Bose store and really liked it. Also, heard it could be a hard drive and has some other stuff like address book. But, in the end, it was too much money for me to spend. I got a 40GB Nomad for the less than a 15GB iPOD.I'm pretty happy with the Nomad Zen Jukebox Xtra (besides the week it took me to rip my CDs, which isn't the Nomad's fault). I didn't use the app that came with the Nomad to rip the MP3s. I started a few days before getting it, so I used a shareware tool called dBPowerAMP Music Converter from download.com. It worked fine.I use it......in the car and now I don't need the CD changer anymore. I have playlists of my kids CDs for them, or when it's my turn, I can play my lists. In my car, there's an auxiliary jack; in my wife's car, we use one of the tape player accessories....in my office while I work...hooked up to my PC speakers' secondary source (Megaworks 250D)...in my family room when guests are over for background music. In the past, we only had a single CD player and kept having to change it. Now, I can set a playlist and let it go the whole night....in the gym while I work out. On the treadmill, I put it in a small fanny pack and hang it which limits the shock to it. I wear the pack when I do weights.Pros-Navigation - Although there is some complexity to it, I got used to it very quickly. I really like the flexibility. I found that it's possible to do what you want whether it's removing a song from the selected music list, removing the whole list, starting a new list, finding an artist/album/song..I haven't found any instance where I thought, &quot;Gee, I wish I could do that....&quot;-Playlists can be made on the fly from the current &quot;Selected Music&quot; list...I hear iPODs can't.-Has a Replaceable battery. Honestly, I'll probably get a new one before this one dies, but it's always nice to have a choice.-The case that comes with it fits well and seems to protect it.-You can use the Nomad Explorer to change artist, genre, and album. This is useful when the CDDB isn't exactly right and I missed the misspelling or something.-You can shut it down and it will pick up right where you left off.-Battery life has been pretty good, but not spectacular. I've done alot of downloading (which kills the battery) and creating playlists and changing music, so it's hard to tell what I'm really getting.-The headphones are pretty good and fit well. They seem a little more cushier than most earbud headphones.-The sound is great.Cons-The scroll wheel is a little weird and takes a little getting used to.-It's a little big. Can't fit in your pocket well.-Doesn't have the accesories that an iPOD has.-It has no &quot;stop&quot; button. This is kind of weird, but you get used to it. There is a &quot;pause&quot; to stop the music anytime you want. The only difference between &quot;stop&quot; and &quot;pause&quot; is that (I guess) &quot;stop&quot; will go back to the beginning. But, this concept does need some getting used to.-Using the Nomad as a hard drive needs to use the Nomad Explorer, so you have to have that installed to load files. It's not very useful since most folks don't have that loaded on their PCs.-USB only, but USBv2.0 was pretty fast. I used 2 computers to rip MP3s. The older one uses USB v1.1. I didn't know how slow v1.1 really was. It took overnight and then some to download about 5GB of music. The Nomad was getting a little so hot that I turned a fan on it to cool it. That seemed to work pretty well.Conclusion: If it's a big MP3 player only that you're looking for, this is a pretty good one. The navigation is pretty flexible, but takes a little time to get used to (because it lets you do so much). I'm pretty happy with my choice. And, pretty happy with the big drive MP3 type that allows me to pretty much use it anywhere and listen to any song in my collection. That flexibility is nice...

review/text: Buyer Beware: When purchasing a cheap DVD, don't bother looking for the access to special features on the DVD menu. You won't have any luck finding them anywhere. I was about to give this DVD a one star rating, but due to the fact that Super Mario Bros. has to be my all-time video game-based movie, I didn't have the heart to give it one star. But, at least the movie is in Widescreen format that's one good thing about it. There are many viewers that might have disagree with me, but that is only because they might believe that the movie plot was not what they would expect. But I can understand why at the beginning this movie didn't work for Mario fans due to the fact that it wasn't true to the video games. But as time passed, people grew to understand the movie a little better. Basically, the movie is about a parallel universe where dinosaurs have seemed to evolve into a more primal species, like us, mostly. And then we meet Mario and Luigi, Brooklyn's all time famous plumbers who are on a quest to save a princess from a reptile lizard king, known as King Koopa. The soundtrack to Super Mario Bros. is great, the special effect it great, and the movie has left us wondering where do they go from here? But you wanna know why there hasn't been a sequal since '93? Because the filmmakers are afraid since the movie bombed in the past, that viewers won't come to appreciate the sequal enough. So they figured it would be best to stick with the first one. But you never know, it could come back anytime soon. Look at the Terminator movies: they had waited about ten years later to do third sequal, so cross your fingers, and hope for the best that someone might have the guts to write the sequal that could sweep the nationwide with moviegoers everywhere.

review/text: This is another track that I first heard on "Open House Party" with John G. that caught my attention. This song sounds like a slightly uptempo version of Fragma's "Toca's Miracle"(because of the subtle background guitar-plucking efx) or DJ Jurgen's "Higher & Higher". It seems more poppy than it does dance. The beat makes you want to bob your head along with it. I really dig Kylie's voice which sounds like a combo of Maria Rubia and DaMae from Fragma. The lyrics may be a little repetitive for some(this is why I gave it 4 of 5 stars). Although this makes them easy to learn, and stick with you. It's a catchy track, that's for sure! This single is better than the other because they included the album version and 2 remixes, instead of the album version and 2 other trax. I wish they would have put a couple of extra remixes on here, though... I do recommend giving this single a listen. You might not be able to get this song out of your head!...

review/text: For many years, the Scarletti family history has been shrouded in curses and dark mysteries. Whispers of evil, murder and insanity have been going around the villagers about the family that rules their lands. They say that no bride has ever survived in the palazzo, and considering the number of women who have met their untimely death in what everyone has come to refer to as the Palazzo Della Morte (Palace of Death), it seemed that the curse is true.Unbeknown to the villagers, the current don has set his eyes on their healer, Nicoletta, the woman whose identity they have protected for fear that she will be branded a witch by those who might misinterpret her gift of healing. So how did Don Giovanni Scarletti find out about their beloved Nicoletta when no one has spoken of her to outsiders? Could the rumor be true then that he has powers because he is in league with the devil?THE SCARLETTI CURSE is a dark and mysterious novel filled with suspense and sensuality. Nicoletta is a very likable heroine, with her wit and exuberance. I loved the way she seemed to embrace life with such open arms. Her compassionate nature and youthful innocence is quite endearing. Giovanni's character is such a mystery. The way he treats Nicoletta with such tenderness is such a contrast from how people perceived him to be.I must say though that even though the author has done well in describing the atmosphere within the palazzo, including the design and architecture lending to the eeriness of the story, there were some parts that dragged a bit. I also didn't care much about the political intrigue, and thought that it wasn't blended in well with the story. I might have understood it more had the author bothered to actually tell us which date the story was meant to have happened (I'm only guessing 15th or 16th century). I know this seems trivial, but when I'm reading a historical novel, I do like to know what period it's supposed to be.Overall, this wasn't a bad book. I did enjoy the banter between the don and his barefoot bride. You can read about Giovanni and Nicoletta's descendant, Antonietta Scarletti, in Dark Symphony (which I'm reading at the moment).

So I took it upon myself to objectively read the book to see for myself what all the controversy was all about.When I read Boettner's book (Yes I did read the entire book, all 466 pages of it) I found so many flaws, made up dates, councils that did NOT take place, and unsubstantiated claims just in the first few chapters, that I HAD to completely finish the book just to see for myself how much of a bigoted author this Loraine Boettner is, and WHY he would write such a book.In the end Boettner never tells the reader WHY he wrote this book, but if I were a Psychologist of a Psychiatrist I would come to the conclusion that here is a man (Boettner) who is extremely jealous of the Roman Catholic Church, and has such a visceral hatred of the Catholic Church that his religiously demented personality demanded that he put down in writing what was in his mind.When Boettner wrote this book it was published in 1962. Why he couldn't wait until the end of the 2nd Vatican Council (1962-1965) probably tells me that he had to put down in writing his pent up hatred before the Catholic Church, through the results of the conclave, changed any of his antagonisms. From what I have read about Vatican II it has changed the Catholic Church a lot, while still maintaining the core beliefs of the Catholic Church that go directly back to the time of Christ.Loraine Boettner did not die until January 1990, but he never wrote a direct rebuttal to this book. Which will lead you to ask WHY? The answer is simple: After the book was released it was clear that Boettner made a fool of himself, and to admit that he was wrong in his dates and other fantastic claims he would have been made to look like more of a fool.It was noted straight away that Boettner's book `Roman Catholicism' is full of false information and unsubstantiated claims. At the time of it's publication Boettner was already an author who had four previous books published. And for him to admit in a follow up book that he was wrong, would have had him put on a `Black List' of writers never to be published again, despite his Publisher being; The Presbyterian and Reformed Publishing Company. This publisher of Theological works is known for their theological bigotry, against any Church or organization that doesn't believe what they do, but especially against the Catholic Church. But it still does not answer the question why this book has been reprinted again, and who is responsible for the book being reprinted.In the introduction alone Boettner lists dates that are not accurate, not just by years or decades, but by CENTURIES! And he goes on to invent councils and conclaves that never happened. True, some of councils he lists did take place, but in referring to these councils and what was the major theological item that that council will be remembered for are totally inaccurate. To a theologically un-educated individual it seems that he is an impressive writer that took the time to investigate all he wrote is true and accurate, so naturally the reader assumes everything being written is true and correct.The one thing that got me to read Boettner's book in it's entirety is that in his introduction Boettner lists 44 items that he calls; "Some Roman Catholic Heresies and Inventions" and goes on to list the dates of their Adoptions over a period of 1650 years. To the un-educated individual this seems impressive, to start his book with such bravado. But with me Boettner was dealing with an individual who took the time to really investigate these `Heresies and Inventions.' No matter what were Boettner's thoughts as he wrote these `Heresies and Inventions' there were too many to hit the reader with at the very beginning of the book, and second they sounded too fantastic. In investigating these claims I found that every one of these 44 claims were not only un-substantiated, downright fraudulent and full of half-truths.There is an old saying that says that a man who tells lies, like politician tend to do, simply hides the truth. A man who tells the truth, like a military officer when questioned by his superior, is an honorable individual. But a man who tells half-truths, like Boettner, has simply forgotten where and what the truth is.It didn't take me long in reading Loraine Boettner book to realize that he epitomizes the old axiom that was used so successfully by Adolph Hitler. Boettner's claims are so fantastic that like Hitler, Boettner is one that thinks, by his writing; "If you tell a big enough lie, People will believe it."Boettner tries to give the reader that he is an academic, when all he is, is a frustrated bigoted writer who is so jealous, and so scared of the Catholic Church that he MUST tell lies that are big enough that people will believe him.Just to give an example of the wild claims that Boettner writes to try to make the reader believe he is an academic, are his claims that the Roman Catholic Church did nothing to help defeat the spread of communism throughout the world and that only the Protestant nations of the world were the only catalysts in fighting Communism. Boettner even goes on to name countries like the United States, Canada, The Netherlands and Spain having spearheaded the fight against the spread of Communism.This again sounds to the reader that Boettner did a good investigative job in naming what he claims are predominant Protestant countries that were leading the fight against Communism.However I'm one who believes that statistics don't lie and one only has to look at statistics to show that in Canada 42.6% of the population is Catholic, as opposed to Protestants representing only 23.3% of the population. In the Netherlands Roman Catholicism is the largest Christian denomination, larger than all the other Christian denominations put together. *In the United States Roman Catholicism has a membership of 74,455,877 million persons, far outdistancing the closest Protestant denomination of Baptists whose membership in July 2010 was recorded at 32,591,991 million individuals divided into 19 different Baptist sects, with the Southern Baptist Convention being the largest with a membership total of 16,228,438. *Then we have Spain, who was been a very strong and supportive member of NATO, where 94% of the population of over 40,500,000 million people profess Catholicism as their Religion. *Finally in the fight against Communism, lets look at Poland where 89.8% of the population of over 38,500,000 million people are Roman Catholic.*During the cold war the government of this Poland may have been communist, but it was the courageous fight of the people of Poland that started the domino effect that eventually toppled every country in Europe that were members of the Warsaw Pact and at one time had a Communist government loyal to Moscow.*Bottner's total ignorance of how the communist system of government works shows out here. In the Marxist-Leninist Communist system of government only 10% of the total adult population were allowed to become `card-carrying' members of the party. Levin believed that the smaller the number of dedicated Communists that held the reigns of power would suffice to keep the country under the yoke of Communism.This is why we have countries like Poland, Hungry, East Germany, Bulgaria, Romania and Czechoslovakia, for example, where extremely small number of loyal Communists controlled the government while large segments of the population never belonged or supported the Communist system of government they had between 1945 and 1989.Hence you have seen uprisings starting in Czechoslovakia in 1948 against Communism, which ended when the President of Czechoslovakia was `pushed' out the window of the upper floor of the Hradcany Castle by Communist agitators to take over the government of that formally `free' country after World War II. Other uprisings against Communist rule were in Poznan, Poland in June of 1956, in Budapest, Hungary in late summer and early fall of 1956, and again in Czechoslovakia in 1968 only 2 months before the Olympic Games.Who can forget the look on the Czech athletes at the Olympic Games in Mexico City in the fall of 1968 when any Czech athlete was on the same stand to receive their medal with an athlete from the Soviet Union. Not only would they not shake the hand of the Soviet athlete, but actually walked off the stand if the Soviet athlete received the gold medal and the Soviet national anthem was played.All of these uprisings prior to 1989 resulted in the small minority of the people that formed the government of those countries having to call on the Soviet Union to send in tanks and the military from the Soviet Union to squash these uprisings.And this dynamic 'domino effect' was directly caused by the fall of the communist government in Poland, again a country whose population was made up of almost 90% Roman Catholics.The fall of the communist government of Poland was followed shortly afterward by the fall of the communist governments of Hungry, Czechoslovakia, and even the former communist state of the DDR, the Deutsche (German) Democratic Republic of East Germany, and eventually Russia herself in 1991.Do you remember that November of 1989 when the Berlin Wall came down?Even "Republics" in the old USSR split away from Moscow, leaving only the "Republic" of Russia on its own. Among the modern day countries that were created after the fall of communism in the former Soviet Union are: The Ukraine and Belarus, not to mention the formation of the three Baltic Countries that were all former "Republics" in the Soviet Union of: Estonia, Latvia, and finally Lithuania, who population is 79% Roman Catholic.**All these figures can be substantiated by referring to the "CIA World Factbook, 2011" which is available thru Amazon, or any reputable book retailer.I could spend page after page in listing all the unsubstantiated claims Boettner makes in his book, many of which are just downright lies written to make the reader believe what they are reading are the true facts.In the end I could say is that this book could be considered a "Hate" book written by someone who really does hate the Roman Catholic Church. I find it very interesting that the Roman Catholic Church itself ignores Boettner's book, and many of the other Anti-Catholic literature, and leaves it up to laity of the church to defend it from hate mongering writers like Loraine Boettner, and other virulent Anti-Catholic writers like Bob Jones and Jimmy Swaggart, because the church itself has better things to do than to answer all the Anti-Catholic Hate literature, and leaves these `rebuttals' up to the laity of the Church through organizations like "Catholic Answers" based in El Cajon, California.Just consider that if this book had been written against the Jewish faith, the Anti-Defamation League would have had Boettner in court long ago, but the Roman Catholic Church would rather spread the word of Christ and let these hate writers burn themselves out as will be their eventual fate.One last observation in regards to Boettner's book is that I spent many, many years in Europe, and it is only in America that these books are published to any large degree. Which brings me to ask myself the question of; Why is it that only in America do hate filled Anti-Catholic fundamentalists write this trash.If I could give the book NO Stars at all I would, but Amazon requires I give a book a rating from 1 to 5 stars. Well here is a hate filled book that is full of lies and unsubstantiated claims that make the writer look about 2" tall.No matter how many times this book continues to be reprinted, it only shows that there are still more hate filled Anti-Catholic mongers out there trying to spread Loraine Boettner's bigoted views. This book should be pulled from the shelves of all reputable bookstores, and thrown into the trash.And don't forget that the author of this review comes from a family that is Lutheran!

review/text: I bought the album as soon as it was released in New Zealand after seeing Nanci on the Bob Dylan anniversary concert video singing &quot;Spanish Boots of Spanish Leather&quot;. Apart from this video and the guest appearance with the Chieftans it was hard to obtain videos of Nanci in this country. I have most of her albums. This video is superb. The quality of the concert production is excellent. The background dialog gives you an appreciation of her background. The songs performed are not exactly as per the album which is a bonus as you get to appreciate other ways of producing the songs. The feeling that comes over is the commitment and honesty of Nanci. She communicates with her audience on an awesome level and this is translated into the viewer's experience. This video is a must for all Nanci fans and lovers of mainstream country.David Askew,Auckland, New Zealand

review/text: I can't say how pleased I am to discover this back in print (I have a rather expensive used copy). I am a huge fan of Charles Williams, and this book is one of my favorites of his, along with the Taliessin poems and All Hallows' Eve-- with the added benefit that it isn't as impenetrable as the Taliessin poems often are. Thomas Cranmer of Canterbury alone is worth (to me) getting the book for, with its sympathetic yet unsparing (even harsh at times-- Cranmer's last scene, ooh) picture of Cranmer mixed with haunting cascading language. Seed of Adam is kind of cool with its rather unorthodox portrayal of Joseph and Adam; The House by the Stable and its sequel are just fun. Terror of Light is perhaps my favorite after Cranmer; the portrayal is just so... right, for example Thomas's rejoicing in rationality and Saul's misplaced (but understood and forgiven) judgmentalism, and Judas's (possibly heretical?) authority even in damnation. The only play I don't love is Judgement at Chelmsford, which is a bit too formal for my taste, with not enough plot, although I'm sure that actually seeing it probably works better than reading it.If you like plays, and you like Williams' other work, then I recommend this. Of course, there are lots of people out there who don't like his erudite and casually-theological/supernatural style, which I do quite understand, and those probably wouldn't like this either. I would also have to say don't read all the plays at once, as he has some language tricks he *really likes*, and reading them three times in a row is a bit tiresome.

review/text: I am very shocked to see so many reviews with five stars for this novel.It was bad, I mean real bad.Some one gave this to me several years ago, and I tried to read it then but it seemed so silly. I picked it up again thinking maybe I would change my mind (I have done that before). It was just as silly as the first time but I bore with it for the most part though I will admit I did some scanning.Besides the main flat characters, the long juvenile plot, and the horrid dialogue (the women's speech and thoughts are also juvenile) there is very little historical content. And it is over four hundred pages! The time period of the book was supposedly around the 1200's but very little in the book referenced that time period, facts or customs.It read like four hundred pages of romance clich&eacute;, but I suppose some people enjoy that style, and I am not knocking them. I just prefer a bit of substance when I read, and this book does not have any.Truth be told, romances can be a bit like fantasy. However I prefer mine with a touch of reality.

review/text: I realise this is a childrens film... but it's dire. Like scream out loud dire. And long enough to make you wonder 'why did I just waste a significant part of my life to this?' The first half is pretty decent but then come the battle scenes. Moronic tosh. Oh so many pregnant pauses - mid battle - while people stop and gaze in to the distance... so many blatant copies of Lord Of The Rings scenes but without the style or competence... so many opportunities to kill the bad guy which are not taken... I walked away from the TV multiple times because it was, well, so crap. Frustrating crap at that. Avoid at all costs and watch LOTR instead.

review/text: This is a condensed and abridged book covering most of Europe. It gives you the highlights of the countries of Western Europe. It is a good book if you planning a trip where you will spend a day or two in many places. Otherwise you should consider DK more comprehensive guides to a particular country, region or city. On the positive side the book covers several countries that DK does not have a guide for yet. On the down side, the only Eastern European countries covered are Poland, the Czech Republic, and Hungary. Also the book is heavy. Is the book worth the money? Only if you are taking a &quot;buffet&quot; tour of Europe (a little France, a little Italy, etc...).

review/text: I'm a huge fan of incredible guitar-oriented/instrumental rock and fusion. Think Dream Theater, Greg Howe, Michael Lee Firkins, Jason Becker...and absolutely Blues Saraceno. I've got all of this guy's recordings and they are all excellent. Most of all, Blues is a fantastic composer and arranger. He writes some of the the most grooving rhythms around and accents them them with amazingly inspired melodies. He's mastered tone and extracts fat, juicy and fiesty sounds from his guitar. The reviewer who said not to drive to this music is just about right--it is really captivating, fascinating stuff that has never gotten old or boring, even on the 200th play. If you already appreciate instrumental rock, jazz fusion or harder blues, you will LOVE this album. Truly a &quot;can't go wrong&quot; disc.

review/text: Foundation is the story of one man's attempt to positively influence human history beyond the grave for centuries to come. Set far in the future, Hari Seldon's goal is to shorten an impending period of Dark Ages from tens of thousands of years to one thousand years. To do so, he creates an organizational entity, the Foundation, and maneuvers to create circumstances so that the Foundation will recreate the Galactic Empire amid a blossoming of science and technology.This book is the first in a series that will keep you happily reading for days. In Foundation, the stage is set for the problem, and you will begin to understand the plan that Seldon has employed by examining the first 150 years after the Foundation is established.The book is built around four crises (Seldon Crises) that shape the potential of the First Foundation to fulfill its goal. In the first crisis, the Foundation is viewed as being a traitorous activity by the political authorities. Seldon explains that his purpose is to create an encyclopedia to encompass all current knowledge before it is lost. The crisis is survived when he agrees to take the project into exile on a planet with few natural resources at the far edge of the galaxy.Fifty years later, that fledgling is threatened by its powerful neighbors who have greater resources and military power. The Emperor can no longer protect the Foundation. Thirty years after that, another attempt to militarily capture the Foundation occurs. Another seventy years later, a fourth crisis occurs when remnants of the Empire start funneling advanced weapons to planets at the edge of galaxy that oppose the Foundation.Each crisis is overcome with a different approach, by a different leader. And the Foundation continues to develop towards its eventual form.These crises are much like a good mystery story. You know there's been a crime that needs to be solved, but you haven't quite figured out how yet. Because there are four crises, you get to enjoy that problem-solving experience four times in one book! Pretty neat!The Foundation's advantage in all of these crises is that it has advanced knowledge and has applied it, while the rest of the Empire is losing knowledge. Pretty soon, things are falling apart technically for those outside the Foundation. The key technology is built around atomic power (as it appeared it would developed in the 1950s).Reviewing Foundation is a challenging task. This book has become a science fiction classic, yet many will see little value in it because the science fiction perspectives and forecasts about science are dated. The book has to be read in the context of the books that follow to be fully understood and appreciated, but how does that help the person who has just finished Foundation? Isaac Asimov used a most unusual style in the book, as though you are a historian uncovering bits of primary and secondary sources concerning a long ago period in time (that occurs in our future). That either makes the book more authentic (if you like that) or annoying (if you don't).At bottom, these contrasts require the reviewer to attempt to capture for the potential reader what makes this book an enduring classic.First, Foundation squarely asks a fundamental question: How should knowledge be built, maintained, and used for the benefit of all? A subset of that question is: What are the appropriate uses of knowledge? These are questions that we do not wrestle with nearly enough today. Many people enjoy thinking about these questions, and welcome their introduction by this book.Second, Foundation suggests that progress is faster with the benefit of planning that takes into account human nature. Seldon's discipline is the reliable behavior of large groups of people (psycho-history). Those who like to plan and those that do not will equally enjoy Asimov's scenario for making his point that we should build from our understanding of human behavior. You can debate the point and have lots of fun forever, based on what is here.Third, many social thinkers have been inspired by the Foundation concept to structure their own changes. Nonviolent political movements match the Foundation concept in many ways, for example. This book gives you a lens to consider many of the global agencies that have been created by international organizations.Fourth, what should be the relationship between knowledge and power? Usually, they are united. But the Foundation posits a world in which they can be divided, and that division could have some benefits. A current example would be the unharnessed knowledge of the Internet. No government will probably succeed in trying to hold dominion over it.Science fiction has long played a useful role in helping society to examine its most important scientific questions in advance. Then the concepts that seem useful become the early paradigms of scientific and social progress. In the case of Foundation, that paradigm here is applied to social progress primarily . . . not scientific progress. So think of this as a book about the science fiction of governing.Foundation suggests a world where knowledge has more power than today, and is also more effective at curbing harmful exercises of power than currently. That shining ideal, I believe, is at bottom the key to understanding Foundation's lasting and broad appeal.Whether you like, love, are indifferent to, or hate Foundation, I suggest you read the initial trilogy before making up your mind about this book. Much of the genius of Foundation (the first book) isn't apparent to most readers until the trilogy is read and grasped.One word of caution: Asimov wrote lots of one-draft wonder books, and was certainly not a great craftsman in his writing. Look past that writing quality to the conceptual brilliance of the picture he is painting.After you have finished the trilogy, ask yourself the question of how you can make knowledge more effective in promoting human moral and economic progress. I think you will find that to be an intriguing question well worth the attention you give to it. And you can think of Foundation to remind you of the question.

review/text: I looked through this book and found it to be very educational as far as various life lessons a child may need to learn. Really I do just want to point out that Larry Potter was copyrighted far before Harry Potter and that by saying it is a copycat is highly inaccurate and unfair. They are entirely different types of stories and styles and are aimed at entirely different audiences. So, if you are planning to buy this book for someone over the age of 5, they probably will not find it very entertaining. Otherwise, it's a great book for early readers.

review/text: This is actually a retitled and edited version of John Bunyan's, &quot;The Life and Death of Mr. Badman,&quot; which is otherwise rather hard to locate these days. Its lesser popularity is most likely due to the subject matter, which focuses upon sin, and the fact that it doesn't have the &quot;happy ending&quot; most people seem to require. However, it is a terrific work, definitely the equal of Pilgrim's Progress or Grace Abounding. Bunyan, as usual, finds new meaning in many verses of scripture that one might otherwise overlook. If you like John Bunyan's work and don't have this, get it. It's a keeper.

review/text: I did like this initially, and thought this type of lid would be more secure and splatter-proof. But it can be a pain to clean, and still splatters even if I pre-treat the rice. After having this a year, the plastic never seems to look or smell right no matter how hard I clean it. I stopped making soups and steaming and decided to just stick to rice because of the "smell" factor to the plastic. My teflon pan is discolored too - although I'm very careful to only use plastic with it and gentle cleansers. I hesitate between a 2 or 3 star review because...the Sanyo is cute , it has cooked rice predictably, and for the first couple months I really liked it. It just doesn't seem to hold up to long-term use. Ironically,I picked up an old Hitachi chime-a-matic for $3 at a thrift store, and like it a lot more than my Sanyo (which will be going to goodwill). I like the removable lid better on the Hitachi, and the aluminum pan (in Teflon vs. aluminum, I actually feel better about aluminum).

review/text: As one of France's premier authors of the 20th century, Antoine de Saint-Exupery's "Wind, Sand, and Stars" is arguably his greatest work among the several outstanding pieces of literature that he managed to publish before losing his life during a reconnaissance mission in WWII.Having served as a mail pilot whose routes took him across the Mediterranean to the African continent & later across the Atlantic to South America, Saint-Exupery demonstrates how aviation ---a profession that often allows for long periods of solitude and contemplation--- led him to make his most formidable discoveries of the enigma that we call "life." Here, we see through the eyes of a pilot as he remembers not only his perilous travels, but his observations about duty, courage, love, war, sacrifice, death, and other fundamental issues that we encounter during our existence on this planet.

review/text: I bought this camera for the ultra wide lens and have been amazed at the coverage it provides and the good quality pictures. The distortation expected by a lens of this width is very low and seems to be well compensated for by the on camera firmware. The display is nice and clear and bright, although in bright sun can be somewhat difficult to see. The inbuilt panaroma feature is amazing and provides great results. I also like the ease of which the exposure can be corrected up or down in 1/3 stop increments and the results seen right on the screen. An unexpected feature is the closeness to an object in macro mode especially using the 24mm lense. I have not seen better macro features on any camera I have previously owned. Things that slightly irritate are the ease in which your finger(s) gets in the way of the small flash unit thus reducing the light output. Also the lack of an optical viewfinder instead of the widescreen display is sometimes irritating as holding the camera in a viewable position increases instability although the antiblur feature generally is spot on. I thorougly enjoy this little gem.

review/text: This book is thorough, in-depth data on the companies of the midcap sector. Having an independent evaluator (not the brokerage inbred stock analysts) discuss and provide not only buy/sell/hold rankings but also give fair values is priceless! The scope of companies covered is vast, and the reviews are extensive and well written. The only down side is fair values, current rankings are a few months out of date, because publishing is not instantaneous. However, this is a good background book, and I like to have a hard copy to thumb thru on those snowed in days. I recommend this book highly along with the s+p 500 large cap and the s+p 600 small cap books. They are all excellent starting places for the independent investor. I subscribe to the standard and poors &quot;personal wealth&quot; on the internet for 9 dollars a month for current reviews/ recommendations.

review/text: I played this CD once for my friend eric and he hated it saying that it sounds like really bad 80s music, well obviously he didn't &quot;get it&quot;. That's the whole point to this CD, it's a retro 80s sound that harkens back to a more innocent time of electronic music when it was wasn't called 'electronica' but rather 'techno'.I got into this CD after seeing the video to '(hey you)what's that sound'. picture a parachute pant, Michael Jackson leather jacket wearing Jacques be-boping his way through the streets of NYC carrying one of those keyboard guitar things followed by a group of 80s fashion disaster clad people (we're talking leg warmers, sweatsuits, terry cloth headbands and that god awful color combination of heather grey and pink)culminating with a breakdance contest and you pretty much get the feeling of this CD.It's cheese but it's good cheese and much fun to listen to. If nothing else buy this CD for the excellent song 'sometimes'. It's a dead ringer for soft cell and if you didn't know that it was les rhythmes you definitely would think that it was soft cell even down to the male vocalist who sounds remarkably like mark almond (although i don't think it's him).Definitely my favorite track that has been set on 'repeat' on my stereo.Buy this only if you can look back on 80s music fondly.

review/text: I purchased this with my Kodak DX3215 camera (which I love) because the tech support staff at Amazon assured me that it would work with multi-media card too. It does not.So the good people at Amazon Customer Support (I love them) promptly sent me a return ticket for it. Pity, though. I had called tech support just so that Amazon could be spared the expense of just such an event.And guess what? It turns out that I don't even need a media reader at all, because that's what the DX3215's docking station does beautifully for me anyway.However, I do agree that you should buy this if your digital camera lacks its own docking base, because its a great time saver.

The word &quot;ugh&quot; summarizes my experience.This book was written in the 19th century, and that's where it belongs. It wouldn't be nearly as bad if someone were to modernize the language used in the book, but reading through &quot;dost thou&quot; after &quot;dost thou&quot; isn't any fun.However, I highly recommend reading Richard Armour's take on SL in his book &quot;The Classics Reclassified&quot;.

review/text: I hate to disagree with so many people who love this CD, but I find very little to like about it. I found the ballads weepy, the upbeat songs cliched, and the singing/musicianship professional but uninspiring. To give you an idea of my tastes, my favorites are Nashville Bluegrass Band &quot;American Beauty&quot;, Steve Earl/Del McCrory Band &quot;The Mountain&quot;, Ricky Skaggs/Kentucky Thunder &quot;Bluegrass Rules&quot;. In my opinion, &quot;The Grass is Blue&quot; does not approach the artistic standards of these and many other current CD's. Once again, no offense is intended to the many people who are so fond of this CD. The bottom line: I plan on making the day of somebody who wants to own this CD by selling my copy to a used CD store.

review/text: ... for Oxford University Press. There are quite a few annoying typos. I can see how the new Forsyte by the name Scames or the unlisted French word &quot;ficbe&quot; came about as a result of faulty character recognition, but how Soames, born in 1855, got to be thirty-eight in in 1885, is beyond me. Don't they have proof-readers anymore?By all means read the book--you may find out how a lot of later works of literature derive from it--but not in this edition.

review/text: Released by DECCA as a celebratory bow for the 60th anniversary of Radu Lupu, this Schubert CD box set comprises recordings made for this label by the great Romanian pianist over more than twenty years, since his emerging on international concert platform in early 1970s. Coming with three first prizes won in prestigious international piano competitions (Van Cliburn - 1966, Enescu - 1967, Leeds - 1969) Lupu rapidly established himself as one of the top performing artists with a pronounced affinity for the classical-romantic repertoire. His refined craftsmanship seems especially suited to those lovely singing melodies and delicate moods embodied in Schubert's sonatas, impromptus, scherzos and moments musicaux. Yet Lupu hates self promotion and publicity, being widely regarded as a genuine anti-star, his arrival as one of the most acclaimed and sought-after musicians of our time has covered him by flattering engagements with most impressive concert stages and orchestras around the world.Radu Lupu's pianism has frequently been characterized as full of delicacy, exhibiting a pure romantic insight and a compelling sense of narration, kindling uneven poetic colours and masterful contrasts out of his keyboard. All that artistry - copiously flowing throughout sonatas and other pieces gathered here - is possible by simply relying on two features of Lupu's way of playing: 1) flawless technical skills engrafted onto a full-range sensitivity (mainly that crystal-clear conception and finger-work leading to his immediately recognizable touch, praised by Daniel Barenboim as "unmatched aural imagination and ability to create orchestral sonorities and textures"), and 2) an unfailing curiosity for the depths of the scores (where he finds solid arguments in order to build-up the adequate atmosphere of a certain piece, with a special care for details).Deliberately, I won't make here any nominations or comments on a particular work on these records. They were recorded at various moments in Lupu's career, on different instruments, in different halls, with - evidently - different soul dispositions, but each of them seems to convey something very deep and unique. As a whole, all these renditions (along with that wonderful CD devoted exclusively to Impromptus and not included in this compilation) offer a faithful image of the evolution of this special pianist's approach to Schubert repertoire.I honestly do consider this CD box set as a must for all who love Schubert piano music and are interested in fine accounts of it. Radu Lupu's are among the very few authentic and valuable ones on the market now. In my own collection it secured for itself a first rank place, a kind of crown pearl among other sparkling jewels. And that is not only for Lupu has - temporarily, I hope - retired from recording studios, but also for the intense and natural musicianship these records breathe. Don't miss this marvel at an affordable price.

While heavily orchestrated under Callier, Arnaert's vox is like angel dust, solo or duo. And you don't have to speak much English to enjoy it. The album never loses its power from Battersea to Milk.

review/text: I, like most people, learned much of what I knew of Ike Turner from his eighth ex-wife Tina's autobiography, I, Tina. From that time to approximately 1997 I had an ongoing fascination with finding out more about often reclusive Turner. Takin' Back My Name fills in many of the gaps left by Tina's book and by interviews that have focused more on his relationship with his wife than with his life and career. Contrary to other reviews of this book which appear on this site, Turner is not illiterate or unfamiliar with the English language -- nor is the book full of mis-spellings. It was co-authored by Nigel Cawthorne, a British journalist and printed in the United Kingdom where the spellings are &quot;proper English&quot;. When sent here to the United States, the publisher did not deem it necessary to change over spellings of words like &quot;tyre&quot; or &quot;recognise&quot;. For those looking for an in your face, honest examination of Ike &amp; Tina, look no further. Pay close attention to the fight that takes place in Texas the prefaced Tina's departure. It takes checking out both books to get a clearer understanding of what made Ike and Tina Turner both spectacular AND volatile.

review/text: This album is just so great that it's a crime that so few people know about it. Sometimes just gorgeous and sometimes really crunching cathartic stuff, all combined with the kind of odd murky and haunting sonic atmosphere that you expect from 3MP. This was album was clearly a slapped-together job, comprising of new material plus B sides and outtakes etc over a period of years. And yet the material outdistances anything else they've done. The bass work in particular is phenomenal -- he plays it like a lead guitar. Also, if you're a fan of Pinback then you really should own this. One caveat: I almost never listen to CD2 -- except for the song &quot;The Trail&quot;, which is great -- and the very first song on CD 1 is really the worst on the album. So don't let that put you off, because the rest of that first CD... wow. Wow! If my desert island disc was limited to one choice, it might be this one. (Well, okay, a Beatles disc might win instead, but only just.) Really, it's that good.

That is to say, the first part, the Customs House prelude, is so floridly antiquated and negligible, that all but the sternest high-schoolers who've never had a bar or bat mitzvah will give up and read the Wikipedia plot summary for Monday's quiz. However, once past that interminable overture, the story actually picks up a bit, though it never really takes flight, and the ending is...pat. Hawthorne's idea of the scarlet letter is much more ingenious than his execution: the seed never sprouts as high as it should.

You learn a handful of phrases you might need but that is about it.

However if you want to learn to actually somewhat converse in Italian, skip this CD.

Along with rarities and 1 cd of Hank's live Health and Happiness radio shows you get a complete picture of the mans work.

review/text: Eversince my dad bought this movie four years ago, I have been hooked. Hookline and sinker. It is a wonderful, emotional movie that leaves you dreading the moment that it will come to an end.Captain Ahab(Patrick Stewart)is a man that is waging a constant war with his inner demons eversince the day that his leg was bit off by his arch Nemesis Moby Dick. Believing Moby Dick to be satan in disguise, and he, Ahab, Gods own avenger against such a creature. Ahab charters a ship, whose crew must unknowinly follow Ahab on his journey through the hellish darkness of his madness.There is one man who dares to defy the utter madness of Ahab, and that is Starbuck(Ted Levine) who pleads with Ahab to forgo his passion for revenge. The Quaker in him being struck senseless by such a blasphemous outrage against God and nature.It is a mariners tale of men against nature, and forces that he cannot, and should not try and control. It is a story of how deep one man's madness can influence others. It is a tale of one's man desire to become a god, to hold the life and death of a scant few people in the palm of his hand.But his madness does not lead him to glory, or even the menial triumph of his victory. Instead, it leads him and his crew to a watery grave, Ahabs lust for revenge nothing more than a death sentance for those that needed not die. A wonderful, but sad movie nevertheless. The music also gives it depths that could probally be not achieved otherwise. Definitaly a must see.

review/text: The key to enjoying the original Foundation trilogy is to understand that the three novels which make up the "trilogy" are not really novels. They are a series of interconnected stories written over time. Foundation is actually 5 short stories. Because of this the stories vary in quality.The second book, Foundation and Empire is actually two stories. The first is called The General, and tells the story of the empire's last ditch effort to conquer the foundation. The weakness of the first story is that all the action takes place off page. We never see any of the actual combat, we just read the characters talking about it. Also, the resolution comes way too quickly. It feels like Asimov had reached his page limit and decided to end the story as quickly as he could.The second story, called The Mule, is the real draw here. All the previous stories presented a challege for the foundation to overcome. However, it was always expected that the foundation would triumph based on the long term scientific predictions of its founder. The Mule throws in a variable that was not predicted. The appearance of a mutant who swiftly moves to conquer the various planets left in the wake of the old empire's collapse. Ultimately, he sets his sights on the foundation. The best part of the story is a visit to the ruins of the planet Trantor. Former capital of the galactic empire.Having finished this second book, I have come to realize that the Foundation trilogy, while entertaining is certainly not Asimov's best work. Time is not always kind to science fiction and all of these early stories were written before 1950, when Asimov was still a young writer. I plan to continue on to the next book, but I no longer expect to be overwhelmed by the classic status these stories have achieved.

review/text: from a surprising source! Joe Esterhaz, not a particular favorite of mine, shines in the telling of his autobiographical &quot;coming of age&quot; story as a teenage immigrant in the early 60's. Much has been made of the immigrant experience in the earlier part of the century, but this film gives us insight into what it was like for Europeans to be transported to America's &quot;golden age&quot;.Maximillian Schell is back on the screen, and welcome as the father of Esterhaz' alter-ego, Karchy Jonas. He is a bit puzzling until you learn that he was a highly educated man in his native Hungary, forced into menial labor in his new country of choice. He has instilled his belief in the power of being an American citizen in his son, Karchy, played by Brad Renfro. Renfro is believable and gives a delicious naivete to the role of Karchy, both in his words and deeds. His relationship to an older woman, Diney (Calista Flockhart looking real, not just cute) makes sense when you see how much she yearns for his honesty and his sense of wonder. Despite a high ethical standard set by his father, Karchy is a noted fabricator of fibs. Everyone who hears his stock line &quot;Lots of times&quot;, knows he is lying.Enter Kevin Bacon, the perfect Svengali for a boy looking to become a man in the &quot;coolest&quot; way possible. Bacon is a hot disc jockey, whose personal code of honor is questionable. There is no question that this is one of his strongest performances ever. From body language to his Texas twang, his regret at how his life turned out (from a brief glimpse he shares late in the movie) makes him a standout playing an early 60's &quot;lounge lizard&quot;. Bacon has a fine portfolio of work, but this is his ultimate role.Music and set are perfect for this nostalgic look back to the 60's. A great film, underappreciated by many.

Hmmm, kind of like Pope John Paul II was not a good ally of President Reagan ? John Paul II and his support of Solidarirty was not at all helpful ? It begins with intellectual incongruity and regresses on each page. Good laugh for those who read anti-Catholic propaganda.

review/text: I have had this wonderful box set for less than a month, and I'm already beginning to wear out the 4 wonderful cd's. For the amount of money it costs, this is the greatest box set ever assembled, and I'm sure of it. These 4 magnificent cd's, cool cardboard case, and excellent booklet cost less than 25 dollars! Although the first cd starts off a bit weak, and the forth cd has some songs that aren't Hank's best, 90% of the songs in this collection are absolutely impeccable! Before I purchased this collection, I knew that Hank Williams was excellent, but I had no idea that he was a God. How on earth did such a simple and uneducated man write these lyrics?! Some of the poetry in these songs, especially on the depressing and melancholy tunes, is comparable to the work of all of Europe's greatest classical writers and poets. If you have the "40 Greatest Hits" cd's, you should still buy this! This is because the demo's at the end of disc three contain some of Hank's best lyrics, and these songs are not included on "40 Greatest Hits". There is more to Hank Williams than just his hits! He doesn't just have great party songs, he also has extremely dark and cryptic songs about death and misery, and glorious and heavenly spiritual tunes. In conclusion, Hank Williams belongs up there with Robert Johnson, Louis Armstrong, Blind Willie Johnson, Blind Lemon Jefferson, Son House, Django Reinhardt, Bessie Smith, Louis Jordan etc. In other words, Hank too, was the blues; and he was a God!

review/text: Whether you are a newbie in science, or do research, Milloy's work is exceptionally relevant, and at the same time intensely interesting.Sadly, there seem to be very few people doing exactly what is needed in this growing area of scientific vandalism, and I applaud Milloy's courage in writing this work and others on the same or similar topic. He shows great creativity in the style and format used to write this work. It is exceptionally interesting to read, and captivates. My copy was on my office desk for exactly three days, and then without a routing list made it way through some of the science staff.I wish I had kept the statistics on this, and could plot the exact point that this work seeded an intense discussion. Perhaps a critical mass of people had been reached, and the fallout was exceptional. I suppose it will simply take more time as more and more people read, and understand the difficulties Milloy cites. It would be a shame to re-live the problems of yesteryear, and with Milloy showing the problems before they become epidemic, a double shame.Awareness if so very difficult to acquire, but Milloy does help open eyes. I would heartily recommend this book.

When I thought about an objection that I could make, or that would be made against my case I turned to this book. I would turn to the objection or issue and there would be the relevant federal rule of evidence easily laid out and explained. Most beneficial is the explanation on not only how to MAKE the objection to the court but then how to properly RESPOND to the objection. This book is helpful as I would know how to properly make the argument to the judge/court. It was also helpful to read over/review the book and look at the objections to get an idea of if you could use something else in your case. At the end of the book it also has the complete federal rules of evidence. I can't say more amazing things about this book, BUY IT BUY IT BUY IT!

review/text: If you love this repertoire (early C20 english music/cello) you can't go too far wrong with this lovely disc. The Ireland is quite well known, and deservedly, but the Moeran and Rubbra less well known. The neglect is undeserved, - the Rubbra is taut and cogent (as you'd expect) and the Moeran is intimate and rhapsodic (as you'd expect).It (the Moeran) was written for Peers Coetmore, then the composer's fiance, later his wife and dedicatee of Moeran's absolutely superb cello concerto (her performance on an old Lyrita LP was one othe treasures of my vinyl collection). Wallfisch is a champion of english cello music, usually on Chandos and sometimes on Naxos, and can be relied upon for at least fine playing, sometimes inspired (as on his Finzi recording for Chandos).This isn't quite at the Finzi concerto level, and possibly reflects a little less familiarity with the pieces(??) but is certainly good, as is the sympathetic playing of john York. Nor is the recording quite at the level of some of Chandos' cello recordings, although its certainly good.For those reasons and because the sonatas, whilst lovely, are slightly-less-than-top drawer compared to the very best works of all three composers, I've gone for a curmudgeonly (and possibly mean) four stars rather than five for a disc of interest, distinction and reward. Recommended.

review/text: Cibo Matto's 'Stereo Type A' is an incredible album. Yuka Honda and Miho Hatori are unafraid of exploring all genres of music while still keeping each song original and their own. Their lyrical talent shineso n the triumphant 'Speechless' and 'Sunday Part 1'. 'Flowers'' and 'Llint of love' are disguised as cheesy and cute pop-songs, but are spiked up with deep, thought- provoking lyrics. Cibo masterfully creates each song using an ecclectic mix of instruments from synthesizers to country-guitar to a slamming door. They have definitely matured since 'Viva La Woman.' They're less crunchy and irreverent, more polished and defined. The vocals on this album show that they are truly talented vocalist, beyond excellent singers. I recommend this album to open minded individuals who are sick of the bland, neatly categorized mainstream. Cibo Matto's music sounds effortlessly inventive and original. This is one of the best albums of the year, if not the decade. Yuka and Miho break every stereotype imaginable with Cibo Matto. They write and produce all their own songs (with other two Cibo members, Sean Lennon, Timo Ellis), and play their own instruments. They are ahead of their time and in a league of their own, Stereo-type A is a must in every dj's bag.

review/text: One day last week, I could not, even after hours of deliberation (the snow had made engagements scarce), decide what book to read next. I finally came upon this little volume on the end of my parent's bookshelf and decided to give it try. How could I have known what charms were in store? I felt like a little girl again, and as Eustace Bright, the ambitious college student who narrates these tales, held his little auditors in awe, my eyes, too, were wide with wonder. It truly is a &quot;wonder book,&quot; full of high fantasy, thrilling action, and the inimitable imagery of a master. Though geared towards &quot;boys and girls,&quot; Hawthorne explains in his introduction that &quot;children possess an unestimated sensibility to whatever is deep or high, in imagination or feeling, so long as it is simple . . . It is only the artificial and complex that bewilder them.&quot; Indeed; the book hardly condescends, and so will gently stretch the middle-grader's vocabulary. But readers -- or listeners -- of all ages will delight in this collection of tales, for I was equally, if not more, entertained by the introductories and postludes to each story, which relate the antics and dialogue of Eustace and the little children he entertains. These interludes also expand the stories by slipping in commentary and interpretation.Don't pass this one by; it will truly win your heart, whoever you may be!

review/text: NO SPOILERS, NO FEARS! I do mention what it parodies in parts, but no scenes are actually given.The whole parody movie thing goes way back to the 60s and 70s with classics like Blazing Saddles and the Monte Python movies and beyond. Lately, in the new wave of parodies: Austin Powers, Scary Movie, etc, they have usually gone into simple, incomplex story lines based on movies that have been recently featured, or as some would consider overrated. Date Movie does this, but unsuccessfully.SYNOPSIS: Julia (Hannigan) is a fat, lonely girl that is looking for a fairy tale Mr. Right, with parents having high expectations of meeting their family's cultural boundaries: African-American, Indian, Japanese, AND Jewish. To help meet this Mr. Right, she goes to 'Hitch' and is 'Pimped' to be the Alyson Hannigan we know and love today. With her new slender body, she goes onto a reality show, where she meets Mr. Right, but not her parent's view of Mr. Right. Somehow he must make her parents feel comfortable with the marriage, accept him as their son-in-law, and avoid the temptations of his ex girlfriend.A real problem with Date Movie is that it really doesn't go with a strait theme. Date Movie implies that it is a parody of chick flicks, romance movies, and comedies. It branchs off however going into odd questionable movie situations like, Kill Bill. Also, there are a lot of movies that were used that weren't widely seen, or were too old for a lot of younger people to actually catch the intended joke. Unfortunately, this doesn't appeal to any older folks, so the jokes are completely lost.Another major problem, and probably the biggest, is that it throws each parody at you in rapid succession. Suddenly its Meet the Parents/Fockers, to Big Fat Greek Wedding, to Pretty Woman, to Say Anything, and even the Bachelor, all within a 10 minute period what it seems. This incredibly short 80 MINUTE MOVIE!! has all these parodies, but unlike Scary Movie, which has many of the same writers, doesn't stay with one or two story lines. Scary Movie one parodies Scream, Scary Movie 2 parodies House on Haunted Hill, and although a large portion of Scary Movie 3 was dedicated to 8 Mile, and a small to the Matrix, it was mostly Signs and the Ring, and meshed much better. All branch offs in this movie were sporatic and random, having nothing to do with plot enhancement.Finally, this movie just wasn't that funny. There are no memorable scenes from this movie that you can joke around with your friends the next day, not memorible scenes that just made you laugh so hard to pee yourself... all jokes fell flat, and made you feel like they tried way to hard to make you laugh. THe most you'll get out of this movie is a har har. It was to some extend entertaining, and you kept watching just to know what happened, but its a one time see at best!BOTTOM LINE: DOLLAR FLICK!! (Maybe on Tuesdays for 50 cents)

review/text: Maggie Smith hasn't played the lead for such a long time that part of the joy of this 1987 British film directed by Jack Clayton is seeing her again. Based on the wonderful novel by Irish Brian Moore published in 1955, this project was optioned at various times by Geraldine Page, Katharine Hepburn, Rachel Roberts and Deborah Kerr but circumstances failed them. Perhaps we were lucky to have waited for Smith since she is heartbreakingly good as the aging spinster who has her last chance at romance when she moves into a Dublin boardinghouse. Smith's large sorrowful dark blue eyes express the waste of her life and her yearning for happiness yet she is never pathetic, even when we see her lying about her relationship with American Bob Hoskins. Their romance is a based on a misunderstanding that you wait to unravel. I particularly like the scene after Smith has learnt the truth when she gets progressively drunker and funnier as she talks to a family who barely tolerate her visits. Hoskins acts with his eyebrows, like a hyper-Groucho, though strangely his weakness adds a dimension to the ending. Worth noting are Marie Kean as the landlady, whose smiles conceal malice; Ian McNeice as her son, a piggy Dylan Thomas; and the lovely music of Georges Delerue.

review/text: Beauty is in the bones. This book gives your story good bones, and you end up knowing why. It is a clear explanation of how to do the structure of a story so the end product is a top model. You have to supply the writing, a big commitment, but you won't have the feeling when you're done that something is incomplete or wrong - and all your work goes to something which misses the mark.We have all seen too many movies where the verdict is "Interesting!" To a writer, this is deadly. It means that all the work of director and actors and film crew, editors and producers, went for naught because the starting place, the script, had the final flaws buried in its pages. Use this book and your story will have a coherence and an internal logic that will be solid and subtle - and when you put on it the forensic anthopologist's 'layer of flesh,' what will stare back at you will be a thing of beauty.

I really need the help in getting my garden going, but this DVD didn't help.- No information on how to create your raised beds (which type of wood to use and why? How high should they be and why?)- No information on how to create Mel's mix (I'm not sure what she used for her soil, she never said)- No information on where to put the raised beds in your yard (Should you look for a shaded area? Lots of sun? Which plants for what type of shade)- No information on when and how often to water- Very little information on when to harvest- Very little information on how to take care of your plants in case of insects or diseases.This DVD was mainly about the plants the author chose to plant, spending about 15 minutes on the various varieties of tomato plants.The only good part of this DVD was the interview with Mel.

review/text: Once the freshest, latest thing in show business, Saturday Night Live is closing in on _30 seasons_ on the air. I was 7 when the Not-Ready-for-Prime-Time Players made their debut, and first became a regular viewer in the pre-Eddie Murphy lean years, but I've always loved the show.Until the rise of Comedy Central and hundreds of cable channels, it was the only place on TV for political satire, and one of the few places for live music."Live From New York: An Uncensored History of Saturday Night Live" is a chronicle of the show's history, told by (most of) the people involved. I expected the book to be narrative, but it isn't: authors Tom Shales (TV critic for the Washington Post) and James Andrew Miller structured almost the entire book as a series of interview snippets about particular people, episodes, or events.The section on John Belushi's death, for instance, includes comments from more than a dozen people, including Belushi's family, friends and writers and cast members from the show.The approach is interesting when it lets you see multiple sides of a conflict or different perspectives on a cast member, as with the extensive quotes from Norm Macdonald, Lorne Michaels, and Don Ohlmeyer, who forced Macdonald's firing midway through the 1999-2000 season.It can be quite entertaining, as well, as we hear Joe Piscopo explain that his Sinatra impression was really a tribute, then hear from the writers who couldn't believe all the things Piscopo resisted on the grounds that "Frank wouldn't do that," including "Frank wouldn't eat in the Carnegie Deli," "Frank wouldn't wait for Stevie Wonder, Stevie would have to wait for Frank," and "Frank wouldn't jump off a building." Finally, in frustration, the writers considered a sketch called "Frank wouldn't do that."On the other hand, there are a lot of voices left out: Eddie Murphy apparently refused to participate, and of course former cast members John Belushi, Gilda Radner, Chris Farley and Phil Hartman and writer Michael O'Donoghue are now dead.It's usually the job of the author to provide an objective and critical eye on their sources. Here, that's mostly missing. Depending on whose quote you believe, Lorne Michaels is either the devil, a raging egomaniac, an opportunist who took advantage of the tremendous talent on the show, a gifted comedy writer, a creative genius, or all of the above.Still, you'll learn a lot about what happens in the manic week leading up to 11:30 Saturday nights here. What the heck does the host really do? How many sketches do they prepare in a given week?And there's a lot of SNL trivia, as well. Who was the first to say the "f-word" on SNL (I was surprised to learn it wasn't Charles Rocket)? Who was the first (maybe still the only) musical guest to lip-synch on the show?"Live From New York" also provides some interesting perspective on the show's history: When did the show shift to being a platform for recurring characters? What led to the "star turn" season with already established performers like Billy Crystal, Martin Short, and Harry Shearer?Still, if you're looking for a history particularly of the show's first decade, I would instead recommend "Saturday Night: A Backstage History of 'Saturday Night Live' ", by Doug Hill and Jeff Weingrad. Published in 1986, it's now out of print, but it's a very entertaining read that tells the story as, well, a story.If, on the other hand, you're curious about how the performers, writers, guests and executives behind the show look at it, "Live From New York" is the place to start.I noticed that there's also a book out now by William G. Clotworthy called "Saturday Night Live: Equal Opportunity Offender". I recognized his name -- he was the NBC censor assigned to the show in its earlier years, and the book is his chronicle of the standards and practices battles with the show.

Being one of the few persons I suppose who had never read or heard about the tragedy of the Essex and having not read Moby Dick either, I was captivated not by the style of writing here, but by the positively compelling events of this voyage which grew increasingly more horrific with each new chapter. It is without a doubt a gripping, nail-biting, page-turner of a book which always brings the reader back to the same gnawing question...&quot;If I was in this situation, would have done the same things these men did?&quot; The answer which each reader must supply to that question is what makes the book so effective.

Most did.Charlie not only had those 7 people killed on those 2nights in Aug.1969 but he killed many of his group membersand any one who dis-respected him in any way.I can say 2 good things about Charlie--he would not eat meatand he never killed an animal. But, this is also true of Hitler.His varied crimes covered many Calif. counties and it washard to solve cases involving his group because many policedepts. did not share info with each other. It is a miracle thathe was ever arrested and tried for anything.The court room scenes and Vince Bugliosi the dist. atty.arebrilliant. Vince is a master in the court room.

review/text: I've never read anything from the 'People to Know', series, and if this book is any indication, neither should you. (...). If you wish to write a bad biography, the guide:* Base your work on the officially published and easily reached autobiographies by the subject. Besides a few obvious interviews and a couple of web sites, look no further. Make no attempt to uncover the things the writer of the autobiography tried to hide.* Don't bother with even the most rudimentary of fact checking, so that your work will contain many egregious mistakes. My personal favorites: according to Karen Judson, Asimov made more money writing non fiction than fiction (p. 53), and 'Golden Age' SF was character driven (p.50). Both of these claims are not just false: they're absurd. Asimov wrote more non fiction then fiction because he enjoyed it more, even though he made much less money writing it. The main feature of Golden Age SF was a focus on scientific literacy. SF before the golden age was relatively scientifically inaccurate, and the Golden Age contained many working scientists who wrote more vigorously about science.* Do not look into any of the dark corners of your subject's past. Although Isaac Asimov lived a comfortable bourgeois existence, there are several controversies worth looking into: his conflicts with his superiors in Boston University, his infidelities, his atheism, and the way he treated his eldest son, David. In his writing career, later Asimov seemed to have sold his soul to the industry, allowing his name to be put on dozens of titles on which he did practically zero work (Stuff like: Isaac Asimov presents Superquizs) We now know that Asimov died of AIDS he received from a blood transfer in the early 1980s - all of these deserve discussion, but are hardly even mentioned.* Spend inordinary amount of time on issues of no importance. The author spends the better part of two pages discussion Isaac's World - a largely forgotten shared world anthology in the late 80s, now defunct and forgotten. She spends no less then three pages making dull summaries of books by other authors, who have very little in common besides being influential books on the developing SF scene in the 1930s. It seems like no thought was given as to what is essential and what is peripheral in Asimov's life.Despite being a homebody who lived very ordinary life, Asimov was a fascinating character, brilliant, witty, arrogant and eccentric. As a writer, Asimov revolutionized Science Fiction, and his work has influenced thousands around the world. As a Jewish Liberal and the son of an &eacute;migr&eacute;, Asimov is a representative of a class that had a disproportionate influence on American Life in the 20th century. But you won't know it from reading this book.If you're interested in Isaac Asimov, I recommend reading his memoir, I, Asimov. It is deeper, more reflective, better written, and much, much more interesting.

review/text: Before reading this review you should know that this is the same movie as &quot;Deadly China Hero.&quot;This film is, as the title of this article proclaims, an interesting combination. Combination of what, you ask? It is a combination of the Historic Chinese Martial Arts extravaganza and a Tom Green movie. What makes the film interesting is that the combination is not as bad as it sounds. Jet Li once agains plays the role of Wong Fei Hung, as he did in the Once Upon A Time in China historical epics, but this Fei Hung is a very different character from the more serious Fei Hung (particularly in the first OUATIC) we are used to.In essence this film takes the fairly standard school versus school and style versus style conflict and extends it to a Dragon dancing competition (mirrors of OUATIC here, but wait) with Jet Li's masterful Dragon dancing interrupted by a villain in a Millipede suit. Jet Li loses the initial competition, due to various circumstances which include the villain's nepharious influence. Jet Li recovers and battles the Millipede in a Chicken Suit in the final battle. Chicken suit? Yes, a chicken suit. I told you there was a touch of Tom Green in this movie, or is it Adam Sandler? Doesn't matter.Typical of the Jet Li/Wong Jing pairing films this is a less than serious affair. If you go in expecting wonderful wuxia wire-fu and a few laughs in a no budget free for all you will have a great time. Jet Li is an amazing martial artist and somehow this film works. But if you've come looking for Fist of Legend you are in for a serious shock in this film.

review/text: I doubt I shall ever come across a better writer of history or Science Fiction in this lifetime.Asimov was a great student of history, psychology, and science. Unlike most students and academics, though, Asimov also was a superb writer in each area and could distill the essence of his knowledge into entertaining non-fiction or fiction. Read his books regarding history of civilization or about Black Holes or about religion and I'm sure you will appreciate his knowledge about such diverse topics and his ability to keep you awake at night reading!I'm not saying you will agree with his every point - only that you will be exposed to a well-articulated discussion.In the Foundation series, it is clear Asimov has combined history and psychology to an extraordinary degree. The question is, was this young man of Russian birth writing of Russia's future or was he merely writing of England's past?You see, a great civilization has encompassed all the known world. Then, inevitably, it will begin a collapse. As in other empires, collapse begins in part due to the burdensome administrative hub (Moscow, Washington DC or London?), combined with a recession at a time when the outcast and downtrodden are fed up with unemployment and unfulfilled promises of a better future (Eastern Europe or the inner cities of America or Britain). This dilemma is further exacerbated by revolutionaries and terrorists in the hinterlands.Enter Mr. Seldon. Clearly he is based on the alter ego of Asimov himself, for the man is a student of mathematics, psychology, religion and history, as well as of politics.I could write a book to dissect the brilliance of the writing and the lessons for all leaders, but will simply say that Foundation, Foundation & Empire, and Second Foundation make up my favorite all-time trilogy. No knock against Lord of the Rings intended. LOTR is terrific but not quite as good.

review/text: Ok. The Fawn was a fine record. The Biz was (without exception) the best thing these guys have put out. Oui? This is still quality jazz pop from some of the most centered, innovative musicians making music today.This still is very original sounding stuff (Like you've heard it before somewhere, but you just can't put your finger on it). Oui sounds like the next step in the evolution of a fine, experimental, jazz rock band. 10 years ago, anything with the jazz rock tag would've been put out with the weekend beer bottles by those in the know. I am very impressed how the distinctive personalities of this band mesh so seemlessly. True, Sam Prekopf's vocals seem a bit limited (one breathless intonation after another), but with the nifty jazz chords of Archer Prewitt, the obviously in (deservedly)demand production skills of John McEntire, and the fine anchoring bass of Eric Claridge, you get a record which really transcends the concept of &quot;jazz rock&quot; (see Steely Dan). I really dig the analog keyboards and the other melodic percussion. The production does sound a little bit like Sterolab-lite (Well, gee, John Mc. was around for that stuff, too.), but that band still sounds like robots compared to this. The four distinct personalities in this band come together like no other right now.The new wave jazz of this band has never sounded better.Recommended for the night after (04:45 AM Chicago time).The Sea and Cake continues to set the precedent for the entire &quot;jazz-rock&quot; concept.(For those those who don't dig the &quot;breathless&quot; vocals of Sam Prekopf, look to fine records from Archer Prewitt. Each one, again, better than the last).

Its impact on popular culture alone necessitates a careful perusal.However, after paying almost $9 for this Kindle version (when I'm fairly confident that a trip to a used bookseller would have uncovered a physical copy for less than $5), I was disappointed to find 3 typographical errors in the first chapter of the book, specifically:"victory Mansions" -- On the very first page, in the very first paragraph, no less!"The instrument (the telescreen, it was called) could he dimmed" -- On the second page (depending on how large a font you use on the Kindle)."ordinary shops (' dealing on the free market', it was called)" -- I've re-created the spacing exactly as it is in this version.I can understand that the publishers are rushing to make their books available electronically, but surely, even Spellcheck would have found some of these errors.

review/text: I first read this novel in 1972, on recommendation from another veteran of the American military advisory effort in Vietnam. David Halberstam captured the essence of the military advisor's duty, and the ambivalent nature of the US Army's approach to it, perfectly. From my perspective, as one who performed the duty in less luxurious circumstances than those described in the novel, there were some substantive inaccuracies. However, the inaccuracies are irrelevant when compared to the story in its entirety. I can say that I knew men similar to each of the characters in the novel--both American and Vietnamese--and Halbertstam depicted them very, very well. For one who served in such circumstances, even 45 years ago, the novel can evoke emotional responses. For a reader who has experienced military advisory duty anywhere, there should be at least some instances of reminiscence. For other readers, especially for those who would like to grasp something of the Vietnam conflict diffrent from the current conventional wisdom, this is a worthwhile read...take it from someone who has been there.

review/text: I will admit that I read this for an advanced high school English class last year, making me one of those notorious 'immature high school reviewers.' However, I'm an English major, and I try to give each book an equal chance and see how they fared in the end. Well, here is Tess:I'm a reader who minds terribly when realism is outweighed by drama and romance. It sounds terrible, I know, but I prefer realism, and become frustrated when there's too much drama and love in a book. 'Too much' is a matter of opinion, of course, but in my opinion, Tess contains too much. It begins to sound overly-Victorian. One bad, dramatic thing after another takes place, and each occurrence seems forced, as though Hardy pushed it onto the paper to further the development of another bad thing. You could say that this is called *plotting*, but it comes across to me as bad plotting.Remember, this is coming from a person who prefers Edith Wharton and John Dos Passos as their recreational reading. Drama and fiction are all okay in my book, but too much of anything is bad. Hardy needs more moderation, in my opinion. So to finish fairly, I'll say that Tess of the D'Urbervilles makes a great dramatic Victorian novel with a beautiful tragic message. However, readers like myself, who are frustrated by large amounts of romance,tragedy,and beauty, will agree that two stars is a perfect rating.

review/text: I have recently watched Ryan's Daughter on VHS about three times, after not having seen it in over 30 years.The cinematography is out of this world, and where all the villagers went down to the sea is so gripping that the viewer could be swept into the sea having to watch for his or her life. David Lean makes all the characters very real. What a powerful figure John Mills played as the village idiot. Father Collins plays a country priest in this village along the west coast of Ireland, but he has tremendous knowing of the people and of life in general. Rosy Shaughnessey is the young dreamer who falls in love with the dashing young British officer, and Rosy's husband, Charles who is much older than Rosy kindly keeps in the background, hoping the romance will die a natural death. Some of the village characters are utterly vicious, and you are made to feel an intense dislike for them.The political situation between England and Ireland is clearly defined throughout the movie.

review/text: I read this book out loud to my family of boys over the span of one week. They liked it very well -- even the littlest brother could follow the story, even though there are no illustrations.It's a story of adventure and hidden strength, as a beloved nanny gives William a play castle with a surprise inside -- a miniature, living knight! The nanny and the 10-year-old child become miniaturized as well, and the adventure to rescue the kingdom from an evil wizard commences.There was a long, slow build-up to the action in this story -- lots of school days, and afternoons in the attic, and gymnastics practices, and long discussion. Only the final 7 chapters detail the real adventure -- the first 10 are just warm-ups.Parent notes:*A lot of lying. A *lot* of lying. William (the child protagonist) lies almost constantly through the beginning of the book.*Absent parents rely on a nanny so they can pursue their careers. In fact, the son makes pointed remarks about how the dad never keeps his promises.*Great knightly values: Be compassionate to the needy. Neither squander wealth nor hoard it. Never lose your sense of shame. If questions are asked of you, answer them frankly but do not ask too many yourself. Be manly and of good cheer. Never kill a foe who is begging for mercy. Be ever loyal in love.*William seems totally unfamiliar with the interiors of churches. He meets Sir Simon in a chapel and acts as though he has never seen a cross or smelled incense or noticed how altar candles flicker. Being in the chapel makes William feel small and quiet, and he recognizes it as a holy place, but that's it. All the praying he does consists of supplications to his nanny, spoken aloud in times of trouble, although she is far away.*One scary scene, when William encounters the dragon, describes an illusion he sees of his nanny burning to death. Another scary scene describes the horrifying process of a person being turned to lead from the feet up.As a parent, I give this book 3.5 stars. My kids liked the adventure and the setting of the castle and the kingdom... and truly, the final 7 chapters were very fun to read out loud. From a values standpoint, this book wouldn't be my favorite choice for modeling my children's behavior.I prefer Mary Stewart's "A Walk in Wolf Wood" as a fictional castle adventure to be read and re-read.

review/text: I gave this game to my son as an early birthday present. He's almost four and loves the Rescue Heroes. The reviews I read were mixed so I decided to buy it anyway. I'm really glad I did. Sure it's challenging, but it's a good excuse for the parents to get involved. First I did the hard parts for him, to show him what needed to be done. Then I guided him through them and finally he ended up doing it all by himself. He was so proud when he accomplished the hard tasks that he couldn't do at first!Unlike most computer games this one requires the use of the arrow keys instead of the mouse. Well, it's always nice to learn new skills.I can't wait to give my son the two other RH games I baught for his birthday. I have no doubt he'll love them too.

review/text: Freud's thesis, The Interpretation of Dreams, can be summed up as follows - all dreams are the mind's subconscious effort at wish fulfillment. For some dreams this is obvious - if you eat salty foods before going to bed, you may then dream that you are drinking water. This is a simple example of you wanting something and your subconscious trying to fulfill that wish. For most dreams, quite a bit more analysis is required to undercover what exactly you are wishing for, and Freud dedicates the bulk of his book to giving examples of such analysis. Freud argues that dreams are distorted because the upper layer of the mind is trying to censor what the lower layers of the mind are wishing for - usually out of embarrassment, guilt, etc. For example, I may be envious of my friend's success, so I will dream that my friend fails, but I am also embarrassed at wishing ill will on my friend, so the dream is distorted - perhaps the activity that he fails at will be obscure, twisted, strange, etc. Freud also makes the point that all dreams have their trigger in the preceding day's events, and once triggered the dream has access to all the experiences a person has gathered during his lifetime, as long as the experiences can be linked back somehow to the trigger event. Since the mind thinks in terms of symbols, the dreams must by analyzed by trying to understand how the various symbols can be translated into wishes, or the suppression of wishes. Thus the inner layers of the mind, or the Ego (prime desires), will generate a basic wish based on the experiences of the previous day. The Super Ego (refined sense of culture, guilt, morality, consciousness, etc.) then regulates the Ego's basic wish to fit within the mind's framework of right and wrong behavior. The greater the conflict between the Ego and Super Ego, the more distorted the dream becomes. All dreams are wish fulfillment, without exception.Freud successfully makes his point within the first 75 pages of the book - the remaining 400 pages are a dry, archaic, tiresome, and in my opinion are not worth the time to read. Much of the book is dedicated to analysis of the dreams of either Freud or Freud's patients. Since Freud lived in early twentieth century Germany, the dreams described are anachronisms and for the most part are irrelevant. Also, I think a lot of meaning is lost in the translation from German to English.Bottom line, Freud successfully explains the fundamental truth on dreams, put this pioneering analysis is archaic and difficult to read by today's standards. For the layman, I would look for something more current.

review/text: I was so excited to finally be getting a rice cooker stateside! But I hate this one. Here are the reasons:1) No handles for the pot. I can't take the pot for the rice out without using a potholder or towel. There are no handles for easy lifting in and out.2) Pot is not secure. When I want to get my rice out, I have to use a towel or potholder to hold onto the pot because it won't stay still when I'm scooping out my rice.3) No beep for finished rice. Why isn't there a beep or a noise to indicate when the rice is done cooking?4) Over-warms rice. I left the cooker on with rice in it overnight, and instead of being yummy the next morning, it was mostly dried out and hard. What a waste of rice!In retrospect, I should have shipped my original rice cooker back with me from Japan. It had all these features, and I got it third-hand. Pay the extra money to get a real Japanese one, not an import.

review/text: As far as documentaries go, this one isn't very good. I was expecting to see a film on the rise and fall of an internet company. Instead, I got CEO and buddy yell into a phone. I was very disappointed not to find out about the day-to-day operations of the company, what the 200+ employees did all day while Kaleil was meeting with VC's, or why they waited until the night before the launch to first test their site (sheesh, no wonder the business failed). Even knowing WHO the employees were would have been nice. Otherwise, it makes Kaleil and Tom's talk of being a family, not a company, sound hollow.Even for what it was trying to do, by focusing on the two founders and their relationship, it didn't do very well. There was so much I didn't know about Tom and Kaleil, no background information was given other than they had known each other since high school. Where did they go to college? We find out Kaleil left his investment banking job to work on govworks.com but what did Tom do before? How did Kaleil come up with the idea of a website to pay parking tickets? Who were the other founders and what were their roles in the company and relationship with Kaleil and Tom? Why should we care about these guys? I quickly found myself not caring about them, their company, or thier dog.This could have been a good documentary if the directors had been more focused. So much was left unexplained, I was more confused at the end then enlightened - not a good sign for a documentary. I give it 2 stars, one for Tom's daughter (very cute little girl) and one for giving me a chance to laugh at two of the fools who ruined our previously healthy economy.

review/text: Ok, a lot of reviewers seem to love this film, and I must say I enjoyed watching it too...but only due to the constant jaw-dropping horror and surprise I experienced during this unfathomable exercise in "entertainment."The plot...well, simply it doesn't matter. Suffice to say that Mae West must be well over 80, but she plays a Hollywood sex bomb who has just married for the 6th time. She is greeted by a level of hysteria on arrival in London that rivals the second coming (albeit on a budget). Her new husband is a young Timothy Dalton, long before his James Bond years. The married couple book into a posh London hotel and there are plenty of "laughs" to follow as their planned night of wedded bliss is constantly interrupted by various capers and intruding ex husbands. My reaction to this was..."Thank God for that"! The notion of an 80+ year old woman fighting off the attention of all these 30 something young suitors is plain ridiculous. Its sooo obvious that Mae (game though she is throughout) is simply way too old to make this role believeable. She can barely walk, and her acting consists of little more than creaking around in tight, figure hugging gowns and feathers (mmm...), patting her platinum curls and reading out vulgar double-entendres in answer to any query from a male member of the cast. I don't think she had a single line in the whole film that a) wasn't dirty, and b) contributed something to the plot!If you can suspend your disbelief about this situation long enough to concentrate on the rest of the film, you'll be blown away by the sheer ineptitude of it, not least of all the musical numbers. At one point, all the staff and guests in Mae's London hotel lobby suddenly break into "Hooray For Hollywood" as she checks in...so wrong, and for so many reasons! Then later, Mae and Dalton enjoy a (barely) sung duet of "Love Will Keep Us Together", and there are many more just as bad. Mae has a few brief solo numbers of her own, and its obvious that she didn't have the energy (or the voice) to pull them off, but they are here all the same. Its all so pitiful and there isn't a shred of irony about it. Some reviewers say the film is tongue in cheek, and is not taking itself seriously. I disagree. The film is obviously intended to be a tribute to the curvaceous charms of its star..it's just 40 years too late! But I'm glad, because the amount of laughs you'll get from watching it are doubled for this very reason. There are loads more howlers that I don't have the space to even go into, but nothing matches the bare-faced inappropriateness of the central issue. So do Mae and Tim ever get it together for a night of passion...? If the idea doesn't turn your stomach, get this DVD and find out!

review/text: Despite the clever packaging, this CD was NOT produced by the folks behind &quot;O Brother Where Art Thou?&quot;As it claims, this CD does contain original recordings of many of the songs on the &quot;O Brother&quot; soundtrack. If you're looking for the genuine article, this is it.However, as is common with recordings this old, many of the originals were made by semi-professionals with primitive recording technology. As a result, these &quot;originals&quot; do not have the clarity, the warmth, or the production values of the masterful performances on &quot;O Brother&quot; and the companion live album &quot;Down from the Mountain.&quot; If you're looking for music that sounds like those two albums, try Gillian Welch's &quot;Revival&quot; instead.

review/text: This DVD is a compilation of short excerpts from Christmas themed Veggietales videos. Some of the "songs" aren't even complete songs, just a portion of another video that has singing. A lot of cutting and pasting different scenes together to make a "complete" song. Not sure how 30 seconds of a musical number can be called a song. Portions seem to simply cut off in mid sentence. There are no traditional Christmas songs so its only a "sing-a-long" if your kids are familiar with the previously released Veggietales Christmas videos. My daughter loves the traditional Veggietales videos but lost interest in this within minutes. The very end of the DVD has 3 traditional Christmas songs that simply play the music and scroll the words across the screen karaoke style with a still background. Disappointed in this product from Veggietales.

review/text: Tess Lindsay is content to be the sole occupant of a remote island but when Colin Macpherson washes ashore her life of solitude gets shaken up. Tess had always been told to fear strange men but she reluctantly strikes up a friendship with Colin. Soon Tess discovers that she has a family she had forgotten about but will she have the courage to leave the island and start a new life?The beginning of this book is very amusing and the end is decent too but the middle is a big problem. The plot loses much of it's believability mostly due to the poor characterization. All of the new characters that are introduced are one sided and their behavior lacks reason. Even Tess and Colin's development is side tracked in much the same way and their relationship seems awkward and forced. The writing does improve towards the end but it's not enough to save the book. Unless you have your heart set on reading all of the books in the series, skip this one.

review/text: I usually write reviews of books that deal with theology and Christian apologetics and other really side-splitting kinds of subjects that, I suspect, provide endless amusement and delight to both of the people who have read them.But I'm wandering outside my usual field because I found this history of a culturally influential television institution to be quite interesting. It is, at times, funny and-reflecting the reality of what happened-at times, sad."Live From New York" basically tells the story of how Saturday Night Live started and it takes the reader through the various eras of the show.It seems that I'm in the minority among many of the people I know, but I think some of the more recent eras of the show and some of the more recent mixes of cast members are just as funny-and perhaps even funnier-than the early days with Belushi, Akroyd, Chase, and the gang. My friends who disagree with this assessment will, no doubt, snort and wave their hands dismissively. Sometimes I say things that these people disagree with just to watch the snorting and hand waving. When you lead a slow-paced life, little things go a long way.In telling SNL's history, the book relies heavily on quotes from numerous cast members and writers, past and present. The behind-the-scenes stories of various people who have been involved with the show over the years are captivating for someone like myself who has enjoyed watching SNL in its various permutations over the past several decades.

review/text: It should be pointed out that free jazz or the jazz avant garde whichever ones pefers to call it was a reaction against the jazz status quo and in the 70's and 80's the self parody of fusion and this lp is a good example of that doctrine. With that siad this lp released in 1982 is a somewhat somber affair featuring two of the most important figures to imerge in modern jazz. The music contained herein is relatively low key and quite excessible and it should appeal to most jazz listerners in general. It accurately employs Cherrys passion for exploring world music and Blackwells intense and ever impressive rhythmic accumen. The standout track is the opening piece which really is a composite of four compositions one of which is a take on Monks Bemsha Swing; basically improvisation within standard song structure for the most part. As for the rest it is much of the same with equal time consumed by both Cherry and Blackwell. There is a hint of some self indulgence but nothing too detracting and given that Cherry and Blackwell are the only players this is to be expected. Highly recommended.

review/text: How often have you encountered a book on Shakespeare or his works that attains a level of writing that is often heart-meltingly gorgeous, even at times comparable to the beauty of the Shakespeare quotations it contains? Probably only once, and this is the book.A helpful introduction by David Lehman reminds us that Mark Van Doren was a celebrated professor of literature at Columbia University, and a poet of considerable accomplishment, who served as mentor to a long list of students who later achieved great things. In his courses he generally spoke without notes, and this 1939 book on Shakespeare's works was also written without notes or references, other than a well-thumbed one-volume edition of the works, printed in about 1906.Any modest power of description which I might possess fails utterly for this exquisite book. Instead, let me give a sample of Van Doren's commentary: "It may well be that Shakespeare in 'The Tempest' is telling us for the last time, or consciously for the last time, about the world. But what he is telling us cannot be simple, or we could agree that it is this or that. Perhaps it is this: that the world is not simple. Or, mysteriously enough, that it is what we all take it to be. Any set of symbols, moved close to this play, lights up as if in an electric field. Its meaning, in other words, is precisely as rich as the human mind, and it says that the world is what it is. But what the world is cannot be said in a sentence. Or even in a poem as complete and beautiful as 'The Tempest.'"

review/text: the first and last chapters were philosophical reviews of life (comparing the exciting aspects of flying which makes life seem so vibrant) against the mundane life of bureaucrats and peasants who live and die without seeing the world (as he does from the air). A line in the closing chapter is poignant: the infant that he is sitting next to has the potential to be anything and everything; but due to its parents and its probable future life, it wont ever realize its potential (they killed Mozart).the second to last chapter is a number of stories of the war in Spain (Franco; remember this was written about the late 1920s to the 1930s), with people fighting; it's a social commentary on war from the perspective of life and death (and has NOTHING to do with flying). This is a very long chapter (50 pages out of a 229 page book) and I was disappointed because I was'nt into reading about this.all the other chapters were of flying (and crashing, such as surviving in the desert), were good, and I wished there were more of them.overall, its an uneven book because it covers more areas than just flying (or even flying from the perspective of life & death). As a recommendation, I could take it or leave it.

Unfortunately, Nasty Savage sounded best when they werent trying to be heavy.

Nor is it for those expecting live concert footage of Syd Barrett with the band (although there is a little without sound). It's mainly just shots of Floyd in the studio jamming on "Interstellar Overdrive". The visuals are terrific. In one scene, it shows us rare footage of a Yoko Ono exhibit in which a model has her clothes cut off by scissors. A very interesting look at a very interesting era. However, at just under a half hour, the film leaves much to the imagination. This might be worth it just for footage of Syd, which is hard to come by.

review/text: It had to be New Orleans because the plot meandered around the city like the chronicles of a certain vampire-loving raconteur from the Big Easy. Don't misunderstand me, I admire the detail, but get on with the story. If I wanted excessive minutia, I'd read Crichton. Too many details derail the rising action and sidetrack the attention span. These characters burn tissue thin except for the side show freaks including Deucalion. He deserved the story and not the two dimensional, reiterated clones that became as souless as their flat egotistical creator (I guess Helios meant that he is the center of the solar system and not just this world). I hope if I live 200 years I will not become as concerned with humanity that I find the need to control it through a B-movie motivation. Helios deserved more. Mr. Sinister in Marvel Comics played more convincing than Helios. I wanted to like this novel since I adored the Modern Prometheus and the Dune prequels, but where was the story? More matter and less art next time! I won't be tagging along for the extended tour of New Orleans for the next book. Sorry.

review/text: Unfortunately, this is the first Sea and Cake album that I have been exposed to. Not that it's so bad, it's just that I missed their premier pieces leading up to this. Had I listened to their other stuff before hand... I would say this album deserves maybe seven or eight stars rather than the measly five I'm allowed to offer.Look, hands down, this is TS&amp;C's crowning achievement. In no othere album have I heard this group meld latin flavor in so subtly, so delicately, that it can honestly make you cry. All the Photos is a perfect example of this. The guitar rhythms throughout the record reflect Brazillian patterns but with John McEntire's steady rock feel on the drums, the record never drops in energy even if the songs are slow and sweet.Sam Prekop proves with this record that three-way fusion is possible. He mixes jazz, rock, and latin into one amzing artistic statement in ways that one can only dream possible. Not only that, but his vocals are so mind bogglingly mellow, that this record could not possibly fail. It just makes me wonder how in the world The Sea and Cake are going to mix celtic folk jams into their music... cause they've got to go somewhere else where they left off...

They mentioned how the title was taken from this book, and it mentioned how this book is about how in the future, firemen burn houses instead of put out fires. It mentioned about this fireman, Guy Montag, who meets a girl but then she vanishes. And in this day of age, their tv parlour, is his wife's family. I was pretty interested in the book and bought it soon after.A week after, and ive completed the short novel based on three short stories. I really liked it a lot, and there are lots of things which, even though this was written in 1953, that are similar to whats going on these days. There was one paragraph, where Montag says about America attacking countries for no reason. Now what does that remind you of? The whole book is Montag journey in discovering what books really are, how much of an inpact they have on people, and the truth.Overall, i would recommend this book.

review/text: It is now three years since Garbage's successful debut was released to the unsuspecting public also gaining critical acclaim. So is second album, one of the most anticipated albums of the year any good? The immediate answer is mixed, on one hand the songs are better, more developed and accessible. On the other, the band has not advanced in a big way, the album literally Version 2 of the first record. Garbage have taken the traditional pop song and mixed in electronica, pulsating rhythms, multiple samples, fused with the distinctive vocals of Shirley Manson. The title `Version 2.0' is an ideal name for this record as it sounds like a sequel to the first. Underneath the dance-friendly beats and sublime pop melodies you're find the dark and twisted lyrics of Shirley, `Temptation Waits' being an example in "I am a wolf, but I like to wear sheep's clothing". The dark and chilling ballads are once again present on a Garbage record. Like `Milk', `You Look So Fine' has crystalline guitars and weeping strings and `The Trick Is To Keep Breathing' is destined to become a big hit on the air-waves. Two of the best songs on the album borrow hooks from other artists, such as `Push It' taking its "Don't worry baby" melody from Brian Wilson and `Special' sounding like a Pretenders song. Overall then, a technically flawless album that lacks any kind of emotion in it's familiarity.

Trisha Thomas has a skill that seems new and fresh -I can't wait for the next one!

I can't rate a DVD I have never seen. I didn't bother to send it back because it would have cost me more that I orginally paid for it. In the future I will watch for the name of the person and/or persons I am buying from. I thought they were a good company.

review/text: Huxley's novel is set on the "forbidden" island of Pala, somewhere in the Indian Ocean. Some one hundred years before the novel begins, a doctor was called to Pala in an effort to cure the local King of cancer. He ended up staying permanently, and therewith influencing Pala's social evolution.As fate would have it, the good doctor was blessed with an open mind, and so the distinctly Western influences he brought to Pala were benign - in fact helpful. Between his New Age science and the King's Tantrik Buddhism, the island maintained a stunning balance between the Eastern and the Western. Everything clicked. Utopia.On the island, education is biological, spiritual, and deeply psychological. Teachers start with ecology, and gradually "bridge" to every other area of thought - even metaphysics. Although children are given all the time in the world to use their imagination, Pala's teachers "never give children a chance of imagining that anything exists in isolation. Make it plain from the very first that all living is relationship. Show them the relationships in the woods, in the fields, in the ponds and streams, in the village, in the village and the country around it. Rub it in."Religion on Pala was pantheistic and pagan in nature. Lots of references to Buddhism, Taoism, chanting, and inner spirituality. In fact, the book itself is a sort of spiritual tour de force, wherein Huxley promulgates another beautiful version of his Mind with a capital M theory.Industrialization of the island never really occurred as such. Instead, Palanesians embrace selective industrialization (no motor scooters, no Sears and Roebuck) and import certain technologies to meet daily needs - like massive refrigeration units to keep crops from rotting between seasons, and a small degree of electricity to support scientific research and whatnot.Pala's sociological structure is strange strange Huxleyan strange. A mixture of social parenting, fertility control, and religious ceremonies involving "moksha-medicine" - "the reality revealer, the truth-and-beauty pill" - "four hundred milligrams of revelation" - the best way to keep the islanders from biting into the "Tree of Consumer Goods." (Why chase the Western god of innovation when you can chase the dragon?)As one of the natives, Dr. Robert, points out, "We don't give ourselves coronaries by guzzling six times as much saturated fat as we need. We don't hypnotize ourselves into believing that two television sets will make us twice as happy as one television set. And finally we don't spend a quarter of the gross national product preparing for World War III or even World War's baby brother, Local War MMMCCCXXXIII." Instead the conduct more research on maksha, hone educational techniques, and make lots and lots war oldest enemy, love.Like any good utopia, a number of critical issues must be addressed head-on. The reality issue is one. On this note, Huxley scores a perfect ten. The book is very realistic; so much so, in point of fact, that he drags the reader to the bottomless depths of "Pure and Applied Pointlessness" and the "Essential Horror" (the omnipresence of death, the precarious of all existence) before building and bridging into Pala's social philosophy of "Pure and Applied Mahayana" Buddhism and "Pure and Applied Science" - a religious and practical science of optimism and wellbeing.It is only after diving and climbing out of these incredible depths solitude and despair that one learns to see again. "Liberate your selves from everything you know and look with complete innocence at this infinitely improbable thing before you. Look at it as though you'd never seen anything of the kind before, as though it had no name and belonged to no recognizable class. Look at it alertly but passively, receptively, without labeling or judging or comparing. And when you look it, inhale its mystery, breathe in the spirit of sense, the smell of the wisdom of the Other Shore."Nor does Huxley reconfigure human nature with a literary sleight of hand, making everyone good little boys and girls. Every society has the possibility of creating a Hitler, a Tito or a Stalin, and so does Pala. But it doesn't. The Palanesians employ therapy "on all fronts at once" with an eye toward prevention over treatment. With detection, prevention, and four hundred milligrams of revelation, all problems are curable. Not the mention the love - which this island has in spades.All told, Huxley has given us a wonder utopia and, perhaps more importantly, a thoroughgoing critique of Western Civilization. A must read for anybody who wants to discover their inner "suchness" and reach the Other Shore, where all is illuminated. "Sunsets and death; death and therefore kisses; kisses and consequently birth and then death for yet another generation of sunset watchers."

review/text: "Roman political concepts, Greek culture, and the Christian faith were the main elements which determined Byzantine development. Without all three the Byzantine way of life would have been inconceivable. It was the integration of Hellenistic culture and the Christian religion within the Roman imperial framework that gave rise to that historical phenomenon which we know as the Byzantine Empire." Thus begins the first paragraph of George Ostrogorsky's masterful narrative of Byzantine history. As this quotation demonstrates, Ostrogorsky's writing is a model of erudition, clarity, and efficiency. It would be hard to improve the quality of his prose, and he maintains this level of scholarship throughout the 500+ pages of main text. But the writing has a natural fluidity which carries the reader along rather effortlessly throughout the full span of East Roman/Byzantine history, from 284 A.D. (rise of Emperor Diocletian) to 1453 A.D. (fall of Constantinople to the Turks). Ostrogorsky gives this inherently rich and fascinating material the virtuoso treatment it deserves, and the reader is rewarded on every page by Ostrogorsky's efforts.Of course, readers of this English translation from the original German of the 3rd edition (1963) of Ostrogorsky's "History of the Byzantine State" owe an immense debt to Professor Joan M. Hussey, whose rendering of the German into English is a masterpiece in its own right. Moreover, through the collaboration of Professors Ostrogorsky and Hussey, the truly extensive references and footnotes have been brought up to date from the 1940 German 1st ed. to the 1967 time-frame of Hussey's 2nd English edition presented here. Of course, in the intervening 40+ years a veritable explosion in the fields of Late Antique and Byzantine studies has taken place, but Ostrogorky's mastery of the original sources, and the German, French, Italian, English, and Slavic secondary literature will not soon be replicated."History of the Byzantine State" is a delight to read, and is divided into 8 main chapters. These chapters are respectively subdivided into numbered sections, and both chapters and sections are clearly titled, so that the breadth of Byzantine History is clear through a glance at the Table of Contents.Other reviewers have complained that Ostrogorsky's writing is dry and lacks a "human touch." I found the opposite to be the case: "History of the Byzantine State" has a cogency and beauty of style, and is a model of articulate scholarship. And with such rich material as the myriad colorful historical human figures and locales which populate Byzantine history, it would be difficult to render this history in a boring fashion. Ostrogorsky's emphasis is the political narrative, but he does not ignore social and cultural aspects of Byzantium, and upon finishing his book the reader has a sense of a complete picture of Byzantine history and civilization. In the paperback version now standard the maps are incomplete, but this is easily remedied by consulting an historical atlas or the Internet.

review/text: I'm a very open-minded person and I believe there was a conspiracy behind the JFK assassination. But this book only does more to discredit conspiracy theorists because it is poorly documented and reads like a novel. Probably 80% of the book is verbatim, quoted material from 30 years ago. Page after page of dialogue is quoted when all is needed is a careful summary of each exchange Ms. Hill had with various persons. It is hard to believe Ms. Hill could have remember in detail every conversation she had with every person she met over 30 years ago. I don't believe it. I think great liberty is taken in creating an interesting story but putting aside believability. It would be a good novel -- but this is bad reseach. I am impartial to Ms. Hill's story -- I think she probably saw a third gunman.

review/text: I hadn't read this Bradbury's classic for 15 years. I had 14 years old then and though I liked it, I appreciate it now even more. Should I think I was not mature enough to understand all the ins and outs of the book?When Ray Bradbury published his Fahrenheit 451 several decades ago, he depicted a decaying society, only preoccupied by its facade of happiness. Not that people are entirely free of the usual constraints but everything is done through games, shows, comics for them to forget the notion of thinking, source of all distress and misery. Those who resist are destroyed, dangerous books (those *who* make think) are burnt. And finally, does it work after so much trouble?Well, at first sight, it depends on the basic purpose of the system. If its aim is to make people happy, it's undoubtedly a catastrophic failure. On the other hand, if it plans on making people believe they are happy or at least act as if they were, the answer may appear less immediate but little by little, you realize that for most of the characters, and therefore for probably most of the society, it comes to the same thing.Montag, the fireman who burns the books, is suddenly confronted to the emptiness of his life. Is he happy? No. He will refuse the system and fight, like Granger and the old Faber. Mildred, Montag's wife, has accepted it all. It's so practical for her to live without thinking, with a virtual family on screens around the walls of the parlor. She has friends she can talk with. She has plenty of leisure, goes on parties, but is she happy? Can she be happy when she frequently needs a bunch of pills to get dopey to the point of risking her life? Obviously not. Same for her friends, you'll see it fast.Two characters are really apart in this book.Clarisse, for example, doesn't like or hate that fake prosperity, simply because she doesn't care. She just does what she likes and she's happy. It's probably the only person you'll meet who is. Unfortunately, it will kill her but her short encounter with Montag will have been fundamental.Okay, I admit it, even if he's not from the &quot;good&quot; side, I've a compassion of some sort for the last important character of the story, Captain Beatty, the firemen's chief. He's really disconcerting, an opponent worthy of Montag. You quickly feel his cogency, his volubility. Despite his current lifework, it's easy to suspect he read a lot in the past and reflected over everything. He would once have been a precious ally for Montag but now, it's too late. He abides by the system and resigned himself, sincerely convinced of its ineluctability. So, of course, he must oppose Montag. The way he dies, the way he chooses to die, is terrible and you'll realize then what despair has haunted that man, how strong his disgust of life has been.Oh, while I'm writing this, I've just remembered a scenery. In fact, each time I think about Fahrenheit, this one always comes to my mind. At a certain point of the 2nd part, Montag thrust himself in the parlor occupied by Mildred and her friends who were watching their favorite show on the 3 walls, the White Cartoon Clown. Montag pulls the switch, and after some words exchanged about the coming war, he simply says &quot;Let's talk.&quot; The passage that immediately follows his request is powerful, from the bewildering words of Mrs Phelps about the children she never had to the furor of Montag appealing them to get out of his house, it's a total delight! I guess it's only there that the reader discovers in what terribly absurd world s/he was dived. This passage is a great moment of literature history, I swear you! :)If you make up your mind and wish to buy that magnum opus, I suggest you buy the 40th anniversary edition for Fahrenheit deserves a choice place in your library. The dustcover is beautiful, with the back reproducing the original illustration. Now, let's remove delicately the dust cover. Wow, there's a nice hardcover under it, the main sides are light brown and my fingers can feel the author's name raised slightly in the same color :) and on the black edge, title, author and editor are in gold letters. Hum! Hum! What's more? Ah, yes, a very interesting and recent foreword by Ray Bradbury, very instructive, it explains everything: the genesis of the book, the historical context, the how and the why. The original introduction (written in 1966) is still there, as captivating as the foreword, both of them are worth reading. From all points of view, I'm very proud to own this edition. I hope you'll feel the same pride.

review/text: Having come out almost right after "The Godfather" (though the book came out much earlier), this movie tried to capitalize on Coppola's masterpiece and the publics' appetite for mob flicks, so it had big shoes to fill. By that comparison, it pales. On its own, it fits into the category of movies like, "The St. Valentines Day Massacre." It leaves a little bit to be desired in performances (cerainly in brand name actors aside from Charles Bronson), dialogue and editing/continuity. But the story it tells is true, based on a book that by itself tells the story of a mobster turned informant because of the contract unjustifiably put on his head. The movie satisfies those who crave the ingredients offered in the mob genre- violence, hits, blood, betrayal, loyalty, misguided power hungry individuals, and mistrust. And it can be argued that the cast of largely unknown Italian actors lends a feel of authenticity to the movie. But it does come down to script, dialogue and what is done with it by those actors, and in that, though the movie is a guilty pleasure of mine, it does come up short. But it does detail the hierarchy of the mafia over several years, how that changed due to power struggles, and how it affected those who lived within it. Bronson's Valachi character is the sympathetic figure in this movie and the movie is told from his perspective and that of the FBI agent to whom he provides information- in violation of the oath of mob code of secrecy he's sworn to- in exchange for protection from his assailants (the agent being the only other familiar face in this movie- he from a late 60s/ early 70s police TV show, perhaps "The Mod Squad"). There is some unforgettable dialogue, but unlike "The Godfather," it's for more forgetable reasons. Example? At the funeral of an executed mobster, his widow pleads to Salvatore Maranzano, the head of the mob at the time, to bring life back to her husband. Maranzano's reply? "I no can bring back the dead. Only keel the living." That said, that's actually part of the appeal to this movie. It doesn't purport to be anything it isn't. On it's own devices this is an informative, if not entertaining movie. Not all mob movies, parcularly of this era or earlier, strived to the award winning excellence of "Goodfellas," "The Godfathers," even "Bonnie and Clyde," or "A Bronx Tale"- movies where the dilogue is as vital as the action. In this movie, the dialogue merely pieces the story together, and not much more. Couple other points of note. Jill Ireland, Bronson's real life wife, plays his wife in this movie. And perhaps the most notable to those who are fans of this movie, the sight of the Twin Towers in the background during one scene, in a movie that takes place starting in the 30s. That aside, taken on its own merits, as far as mob movies from its period, this one ain't so bad, which I admit isn't exactly a ringing endorsement.

The whole 650 MB capacity CD contain the Nokia WAP Toolkit (an old version), and a WAP Toolkit of Ericsson plus Ericsson R380 emulator and that's it! No editors, no GPRS simulators. I still can not understand why did they stick such a content-less CD at the back of the book.Good luck...

review/text: After purchasing and watching this movie, I can see why there is such a cult following. The movie was obviously made with very little budget, but the quality blew me away. The movie follows a town that gets taken over by vampires. They attack innocent people and drink lots of blood. The similarities to other vampire movies stops there, however. The acting in this movie is non-existent, but the action explods off the screen. The gore and death scenes are great, and I was shocked (Thats real blood, people). Chainsaw weilding maniacs, and ghouls of the night.This movie took WAY too long in production, but the special features, and movie transfer are WELL worth the wait.Great (Dare I say "B") vampire genre film.Keep in mind this IS very low budget-so if you're expecting "Blade", you will be dissapointed.

review/text: Let me resurrect an old cliche & say that "Inquest on the Shroud of Turin" is good news and bad news. The good new is that several of the chapters are very strong, providing compelling reasons to discount the authenticity of the Shroud of Turin as the burial cloth of Jesus. I think the most enlightening chapter was at the beginning of the book & dealt with the provenance of the shroud. It was clear from its origin in 1355 that the cloth was a fraud. The early provenance shows that the only medieval contemporaries who did not discount the shroud as a fake were those who were profiting from displaying it to pilgrims in return for alms. Bishop Pierre D'Arcis wrote an investigation report stating that the shroud is a painting, & this fact was attested to by the artist who painted it. Even the pope discounted its authenticity when he issued a bull directing it could only be displayed as a "representation" and not as an authentic relic. It is amusing to think that the medieval mind had clearer insight into the shroud's bona fides than many modern minds.Another strong chapter is the one that deals with the research of Walter McCrone. (...) In any event, McCrone concludes the shroud bears traces of paint pigment (as predicted by the provenance) & that proteins on the shroud are not blood but rather the paint medium tempra. What do you call a piece of cloth with paint pigment & paint medium on it? McCrone and Nickell conclude that it is a painting (as one might expect).Now for the bad news: "Inquest" suffers from several weaknesses. Many of the chapters become lost in technical detail which I think detract from the strength of the overall argument. Why make a subtle argument when there is an obvious argument to be made that is more compelling? Also, I noted one occasion where Nickell placed emphasis where he should not & the result was misleading. Nickell states that according to the New Testament, the body of Jesus was buried according to Jewish custom, & therefore the body must have been washed. The truth is that the New Testament does NOT say the body was washed. This whole line of reasoning should have been left out in my opinion since it is misleading & detracts from the overall argument.Another weakness is that the book has not been updated since the Carbon 14 tests were published showing that the shroud is only 700 years old. This makes the cloth about the same age as the provenance indicating it is a fake. A new chapter would tie all this together quite nicely.Other reviewers have criticized Nickell for his lack of credentials as a scientist. If they had read the book more carefully (or at all), they would have noted that this book is clearly presented as a collaborative effort with technical specialists. Not only did Nickell consult on research, some whole chapters are ghost written by his collaborators. Another criticism is that the shroud could not be a painting since there is no brush strokes & no directionality. In spite of what other reviewers have said, these matters are addressed in the book. There are no brush strokes because the artist didn't use a brush. Furthermore, Nickell does discuss how paint could be applied without an indication of directionality. Read the book for more details.Finally, there is one interesting argument Nickell touches on but does not develop. The image of the face on the shroud shows evidence of fresh bleeding from scalp wounds. Nickell points out that there should be no blood because the body was washed. An alternative observation is that when a person dies, the heart stops, blood pressure drops to zero, & lividity begins to set in. A dead body simply does not bleed (at least not like the fresh stream of blood seen on the face of the shroud). Hypothetically, if the shroud were indeed the burial cloth of Jesus, it means that he did not die on the cross, but that he was taken down while still alive. No death on the cross means no resurrection, & this conclusion would turn Christian theology on its head. It appears that this one observation would give the faithful plenty of reason to reject the authenticity of the shroud, rather than defend it.

review/text: William Trevor's precise, descriptive prose brings to mind other current authors (Pete Dexter, Tom Wolfe) who enable readers to visualize, as if viewing a film, the details of a scene--from beads of sweat trickling down a character's cheek to the colors in the oil paintings decorating a wall. Treveor uses this admirable technique to great employ in this enigmatic story of the relationship between a predator, a seemingly kindly bachelor, and his prey, a frightened pregnant Irish teen come to England to look for the father. The issue of free will as the Creator envisions it is examined here: the predator, Mr. Hilditch, in his manipulative fashion, carves out a destiny for Felicia (and, unwittingly, himdself) that suggests a control one might ascribe to a Deity. The ending is cryptic and odd; one can take the events and their aftermath in any number of ways and Trevor is of no help in steering one in the proper direction. Perhaps that's a good thing--the ending is far more haunting than the rest of the novel.(The unabridged audiobook I listened to was read by Simon Prebble, not Dermot Crowley. Prebble's interpretation, as well as his vocal characterization, is flawless.)

review/text: Look at the album's cover and listen to some song samples; you'd think that the music on 'Arular' would be more revolutionary. Instead, it's a lot of simple beats (that most people could program with Fruity Loops) and somewhat grating vocal stylings, with lyrics and packaging that feign to but don't have much of a point. Many of the reviews I read before purchasing the album referenced Maya's storied past ("revolutionary" father, living in the UK, etc.) as well as a recommendation from Trent Reznor. However, Maya doesn't seem to transfer many of those varied experiences to her music. Sure, she may dis George W. and use the word "bombs", but does referencing keywords such as these a revolutionary make? I think not. How seriously can you take someone whose opening track consists of her repeating the syllables of "banana"? Many of her lyrics wouldn't sound out of place on the latest Lil' Jon album.If you're looking for music that doesn't pretend to be something it's not, check out The Bug's "Pressure", The Clash's "Sandinista" (what does Maya think she's accomplishing by referencing the Clash?), Basement Jaxx, or the multitude of Timbaland productions that Maya seems to idolize so much.It may sound like I have a vendetta against Maya and her producers (some of the beats would sound great in a mix). I don't: I'm simply trying to balance some of the hype with a more realistic point of view. Something's not classic if it's merely a pastiche of other things.

review/text: A classic! Easily one of the best books ever written, and possibly Vonnegut's greatest work. The story of Campbell was so compelling, the first time I read it I finished it in one sitting. I am now reading it again for the fourth time, and it still enraptures me. Vonnegut's style is superb, and the skill with which he weaves this tale is astounding. The ending shocked me, and it still haunts me every time I read it. The only regret I have is that I can only give it 5 stars.

review/text: In Fahrenheit 451, Ray Bradbury's frightening vision of the future, firemen don't put fires out; they start them to burn books. In Bradbury's fictional world, it is better not to know or find out anything because if you know too much, you could be in danger. This book is closely related to the book 1984 by George Orwell because you can be put to death for simple things like writing in a diary. In Fahrenheit 451, you can have your house burned down and go to jail for the rest of your life if you are caught with books because reading for pleasure is against the law. The main character, Guy Montag, is a fireman who burns books for a living. He sees his wife sit at home everday with the "family" who is actually just a television that surrounds the walls, when he starts to question his life. Why are books burned? Why are they so destructive to society? He makes the decision to change his life, risk everything he's worked for and discover what it is that books contain. Montag starts secretly hiding books in his house and reading them at any opportunity he gets. He learns that there is a whole world inside of books that he never knew existed. He tries to tell his wife about this and how books are so important but instead of agreeing, she turns him in to the police. After this incident, Montag's house is burned down and he is confronted by the police chief, Captain Beatty, and has to decide what he is going to do. Although this book was published back in 1953, the idea of firemen getting paid for burning books seems very real. These ideas make you think that maybe someday this could happen. Fahrenheit 451 is a book for ages 13 and up. The incredible descriptions of books burning,along with houses and the mechanical dog are very realistic. I thought this book was good because of the descriptions, you felt like a part of the book and it made you want to keep reading. I would recommene this book to any and everyone.

review/text: This book is structured such that on all the even pages there are a short pithy quotes that summarize the textaul body of the book on the odd pages. The book is written in the style of a manual so that you can dip into it at any point with no need to refer to material that came before.The basic thesis of the book is if you want to enjoy life you have to place one hand on the tiller and steer yourself towards the people, places and things that you like. A way to chart your course is taken from Alan Lakein's "How to get control of time and your life", which is an excellent book. Strategies for dealing with misteps are also covered.The author tries overtly to avoid religion, but a slight Christian undertone runs through the book, probably unintentionally because of the author's and those he quotes cutltural background.

review/text: Mr. Feldman has brought a lot of clear thinking, history, and a legal opinion to the separation of church and state in the US. Like a good legal opinion, much of the book is on prerequisites, i.e. history. Only in the last fifty pages or so does he get to the present and future.It is an interesting problem. We (that's the universal we, as everyone must think like I do) look at Islamic fundamentalists as somewhat crazy. Yet it seems that the American fundamentalists are not too far different in their blowing up of abortion clinics, or Pat Robertson wanting to kill the President of Venezuela (or maybe just kidnap him).It further seems that the more science learns about things, the more that some people reject the scientific evidence in favor of knowing in their own mind that God didn't do it that way.I'm not so sure that this isn't just a current fad. One day the Democrats will decide that they want to get back into power and start putting together candidates that can win. Perhaps then we'll go back to some form of sanity.

review/text: Markham's book on Napolean is incredibly fast paced. Napolean's life could (and often does) fill volumes, but Markham fits it all in a surprisingly small book. I bought this book on a recommendation from a history professor with the intention of quickly filling in a gap of history that I was less informed about. Essentially, it did just that. You could almost compare the book to a large encyclopedia entry. Not that it's bland or dry, but it is informative and sans literary fluff.Overall, however, I enjoyed the book and would definitely would recommend it to anyone seeking to quickly grasp who Napolean was and how his life shaped Europe. A great introduction to this overwritten topic.

review/text: Daniel Day Lewis as a Prague doctor, hoping for a little afternoon pleasure while on a medical trip, hits upon and scores with Juliette Binoche, but drives off, rudely, in his sports car, when his afternoon delight reveals she lives with her mother. End of story, until she shows up at his door in Prague to continue the conversation. Great opening, but soon I couldn't help but wonder why these two oddball Berlin Wall era ambiguous revolutionaries are so madly in love with each other. We are told that repeatedly, and a marriage union locks the deal, but they seem about as chemically inclined towards one another as a bland peanut butter and jelly sandwich; there for the sake of being. But they are, apparently, the Scarlet and Rhett of the fall of The Soviet Empire, helplessly involved in a Cold War deadlock with Russians who are revealed as typically sitting at a long table in a bar, kicking back vodkas, and behaving like Boris and Natasha from The Bullwinkle cartoons. Come on, really? Lena Olin's nude exhibition with a tophat was a pretentious symbol of democratic freedom, and the potboiler romance and revolution is forever on a low simmer, when it needs to be boiling over. If the film would have stopped when Juliette Binoche shows up unexpectedly at Daniel Day Lewis's door, and they made wild rebellious graphic sex defying all conventions for the duration of the film, (no top hats please, that is SO Al Pacino 'Cruising'), this cold war wouldn't have been so frigid.

It is no longer set in a future controlled by corporations, it is set in the near present which is pretty much like reality. The hero doesn't hold a candle to James Caan.It does have plenty of action, if mindless action is to your taste. The rollerball arena is poorly designed which makes following the action difficult at times. The villiam is just another greedy businessman/crook with nothing to make him stand out from a 1000 other businessman/crooks in other movies.My adive?

The bottom wood actually came with a huge crack; big enough to leak out all the sand. The feet were glued on with cheap glue and 3 of the 4 came off in transit. Based on the construction, I'm amazed it was even in one piece.The reason this gets 2 stars is that the accessories are pretty decent. And the sand looks fine. If this wasn't cracked in the center, I'd most likely have kept it and it would have "worked" for its purpose. Having said that, if you are looking for a desktop zen garden, look elsewhere.

review/text: If you've yet to read this masterpiece, hurry. When you get tired of reading or think that what Orwell writes is unrealistically drab, then flip on CNN and catch your daily dose of propaganda. The world of 1984 is modern America, bin Laden is Goldstein and the book is terrifying. John Ashcroft on 1.29.02 ordered a semi-nude statue of Justice in the Justice Department to be covered by a sheet (check the nydailynews.com archive - No Nudes Good News at Justice). 1984 depicts a world in which the populace suffers but suffers because a war is being waged, a war against faceless terrorists whose existence is only proved by the occasional bombing and "telescreen" broadcasts of the Brotherhood's evil leader Goldstein. Life in Airstrip One (UK) is a miserable existence with barely enough food, many people going without shoes, no art, no free speech and cheap, rotgut alcohol. Give the recession and the Bush administration a few more years in their 'war against terrorism' and see if you can even still find this book outside of illegal personal collections.After you're done with 1984 check out "Homage to Catalonia" Orwell's account of his time spent in the Spanish Civil War on the side of the Communists and Anarchists (which means believing in no central government by the way, the way the Native Americans, Druids and numerous other peoples lived, not all out savagery like the American thought police would have you believe) versus the Fascists. Homage to Catalonia will help you have a better understanding of what WWII was all about, how the advent of technology set the stage for the top nations in the world to battle of raw materials, slave laborers and market share. Do some research and see that nearly all of Europe was Socialist or full on Communists at the time of WWII and then realize that American Fascism and Soviet Communism (really Soviet Fascism) defeated Nazi Fascism and that the Cold War was necessary for American Corporations to grow and take over the world with every country that didn't want to be bent over by the US Corps. being invaded outright or overthrown by American backed troops for being Marxists. The collapse of Soviet Russia was disatrous for America because no bad guy meant we had to pay back debts and answer for the daily suffering of millions of Americans. Enter the evil camel jockeys and the questions of fairness for the common man are again put on the back burner.

review/text: For those of us who would prefer to use sourdough starter as the sole leavening agent in making breads, this cookbook is very helpful in getting us "started". There are some receipts calling for the addition of yeast, and baking soda is often added not so much to leaven loaves as to create a chemical change which dampens some of the sourness in a very sour pot of starter. Overall, this book gives some of the best history of sourdough from a lady who knows first-hand the importance of an active sourdough starter, and will get any beginner started off making some very good breads, rolls, breakfast items & desserts. There is even a section at the end for making various products from the wild berries grown in the Last Frontier (for those of us who are able to utilize lingonberries & such)! Even for those who don't care to do a lot of baking, this book has a great deal of interesting information about Alaska & its pioneers - a great read for celebrating our 50th year of Statehood!

The album got 5 stars (from me) for the following: Production, Orchestration, Song selection (its great to hear the really OLD songs from the vast Streisand Catalog) and finally for Babs herself. The addition of Il Divo is joke! A Woman of such legendary status, especially with the amount of adoration and respect Babs commands does NOT need help from a group of guys who sound like they're warbling their way through songs. Of course, Babs is older here and her voice does show its age but what can you expect from a DIVA who has spent the last 40+ years singing, producing albums, movies and solid concert tours?

review/text: From Potters Field is one Patricia Cornwell's worst book she has written. It's not the characters, nope. It's not the writing that is wrong. It's the story that makes the book disappointing.Temple Gault has struck again. This time we know this for sure. Both the readers and Kay Scarpetta do. Someone from Lucy's past is also back. The problem with this book is that Gault is not a strong enough villain to carry this book. He is not scary or very threatening. It's not exiting. Partly because we never get into his head we are always inside Scarpetta's. Even if Cornwell did venture inside his head I'm not sure if it would be that exiting. For a killer on the loose plot its very weak, of coarse the forensics are very good and original. But for the most part a very disappointing Scarpetta novel.

review/text: Mere Christianity by C.S Lewis was derived from three radio lectures given by the author during the Second World War. Lewis is a well-known mid-twentieth century writer with popular works in a variety of genres; religious fiction, children's fiction, science fiction as well as religion/philosophy.Mere Christianity remains, probably, the most significant twentieth century Christian apologetic text. Lewis employs what is known as the classic approach to apologetics - starting with a general argument for the existence of God then moving on to make the specific case Christianity. Contrary to an earlier reviewer - this is a general introduction aim at the lay reader. Although all readers can find it helpful, it is not aimed at "intellectuals". Readers seeking more significant philosophical argumentation on these types of issues may want to look at the likes of Plantinga, Craig, Moreland etc.One small criticism of the book is the last chapter - it has 1940's speculative science fiction feel. Lewis' interest in science fiction; coupled with the progressive view of evolution popular among thinkers at the time makes it feel dated and a bit out of place for an introductory text.Overall, Mere Christianity is a classic (The audio version is also tremendous). I highly recommend it as a starting point for anyone interested in Christian apologetics. Readers that enjoy this may also like The Screwtape Letters and the Great Divorce also from Lewis.

review/text: (...) This is a beautifully written book that manages, as successfully as any other book has, to capture the enormous wealth and breadth of the human experience -- from one family (and one town)'s point of view. No book could ever encompass the entire human experience; but this book does a hell of a job, beginning with the founding of Macondo to its eventual obliteration(guess how many years later). One reviewer states that reading the book feels like reading Genesis from the Bible, and I think that's about right.To those of you who dislike/have trouble with "magical realism," just relax. Yes, you'll have problems if you think literally but what are books for? What is fiction for? Fiction is MADE UP. Good grief. Pretend you're at a movie, suspend your disbelief and get into the beautiful writing and wit and humor. It's a difficult book at times and the fact that everyone has similar names is very annoying, but what rewarding book isn't challenging?After you read the book, find Marquez's short stories, some of which are about Macondo and flesh out some things that the book leaves out (e.g. Big Mama's Funeral Carnival).I don't like or watch Oprah, and her choosing of this book is a little disturbing because now she's plowing into the territory of books I not only can't sneer at but absolutely love. Well, I suppose it had to happen sometime.

review/text: Lenin's Tomb is an autopsy of sorts, performed by one present during the last death throes of the Soviet Union. There are ultimate causes of death (a non-functioning economy), as well as underlying factors (a history of repression, totalitarian rule) contributing to this body politic's demise.Imagine a coal mine with no elevator in the shafts so the miners have to walk 2 hours to get to their place in the mine where they can start working. The kicker: they don't get paid for travelling to and from their place in the mine. Imagine Soviet prisoners of war released after WW2, only to have Stalin send them to labor camps because he was afraid they had lived too long under foreign influence.There are stories of people who were part of the system yet tried as much as they could to follow their conscience so they could somehow bridge the chasm cleaving their souls in two. Remnick describes hardliners, people who genuinely long for the days of Stalin, and with a compassionate eye, tries to describe the world they have lived through and now find themselves orphans of sorts in the new order.I was amazed that so many lived and died so miserably for so long. Remnick's research, interviews and astonishing eye for detail makes the faceless numbers who lived through 70 odd years of the Soviet Union come alive and lets the reader share in their trials and their triumphs.

review/text: MANSON IN HIS OWN WORDS - BEWARE , 'DREAMS YE CONQUER CARE!'Hello there fans of amazon.com Manson litterature - just to let everyone know , Manson in His Own Word isn't by Manson himself.Ask yourself; why should a man who has got all the time in the whole wide world to leave his body and go anywhere he wants , go spend some time write a book he didn't even announce , seemingly on any interview that he was gonna write?Let's never underestimate the fact that Charles Manson is Charles Manson , and that like the wolf , scorpion and black panther , Charles Manson is so unpredicteable that I sound like a dammer when I say to all the five and four star viewers here that this book wasn't written by him. I trusted my source and made a decision in advance since , that from then on I'd write a critical review on Manson In His Own Words that'd expose the myth that the book had in fact been written or compiled by Charles Manson , number two , that it was a good book , and number three , that Manson would be likely to spend vast amounts of time to pin down some words in some script instead of doing the soul of the world thing - which is his music.After having seen the white and red covered , now internationally acclaimed Manson movie , I feel I have somewhat more of an understanding of Manson's mind than many others. As a teenager I felt I understood Manson to the point that I drew a picture of myself , bald headed with a nazi swastika between my eyes to emphasize the concept of what we felt then to be holy or sheer terror. I was obsessed with exorcicing any fear inside of myself at that time - that is during my teenagehood years , and I was thus seriously sinister as a teenager and I enjoyed that reputation. But just because I may feel so on what I feel to be my understanding of how Charles Manson's mind works or operates , that's just me - no need to take seriously any content in a statement I make on such an issue , because everyone is free to have their own opinions - the people of the world are entitled to free speech.Manson could utter all he needed to utter and why should he have had any need to put that down on a few pages? A book compiled by Manson would in my view be a gigantic volume filled with all kinds of psychedelic imagery which not even the author of this book would be finding himself or herself in a position to comprehend fully.On atwa.be. Charles Manson said that God is air - and that without air , we cannot be. So this gives in my view a whole different meaning the concept of our ideas and beliefs being sort of air - without them , we can't forge the years ahead in our societies. No matter how many or few Charlie may have killed or how he may have behaved , no matter how sane or less than sane he may appear , because we're all one and we're all manifestations of the Infinite , the more we lie to ourselves and cheat on ourselves and beat our little ones before we put them to bed , the harder we are on ourselves and the less we are really saying , and everything we are saying becomes a kind of chit chat - thus , we're lying to Charlie.That is , we are lying to him when we're lying to ourselves , and encouraging ourselves to be more violent than is necessary by being more violent than is necessary. Once peoples'seemingly ceaseless desire to lie to themselves so much ceases to be , it becomes easier to rise above that need and move on. In Charlie's world , Charlie can be a racist one moment and a humanist the other - but that's his path - and anyone around or near him has to make their choises on what path to follow - and those beyoud.So I say to anyone who wishes to give this book a try - I felt I was somehow obliged to leave a warning in advance stating this book is no good. I might wanna own a copy in the far future but I seeeeeeriously doupt if that copy'll do me any good at all. The study of Charles Manson is a direct look at our own innermost self reflection - and it depends upon each one of us whom it is being reflected in the mirror. That's why beauty is truly in the eyes of the beholder when it comes to do a serious analysis of the meaning behind the concept of the persona who is Charles Manson.

Difficult to put together (and I have assembled my share of kid's toys), it will not stay together at all. It is challenging (at best) to get the figures in the elevator, and none of the figures with capes will fit - they tend to get stuck halfway up. The elevator also requires the child to turn a little wheel to get it to go up - too difficult for little ones. It requires a degree in engineering to get the little plane to fold up inside the watchtower - very poor and frustrating design.

review/text: Marlon Brando and Maria Schneider star in this powerful film about an older American man, a younger French woman, and the heights of sexuality and seduction.Brando stars as Paul, a 45-year-old American widower who's coming to grips with his wife's suicide. His wife slit her wrists in the bathroom, leaving no note behind for Paul. All that she left him was the ownership of the seedly flop-house motel she had owned. Forced to deal with this bizarre change of events in his life, Paul goes out searching for an apartment.Schneider stars as Jeanne, a young 20-year-old Parisian girl. She's sexy, vivacious, flirtatious, innocent, and adventerous all at the same time. She's engaged to be married to her filmmaker boyfriend. She, too, is looking for an apartment.By chance, Jeanne and Paul end up looking at the same apartment. Both are intrigued; not just by the apartment, but by each other as well. Soon, they are having rough sex up against the wall. What begins after this encounter is a bizarre yet meaningful relationship which exists only inside the apartment. No names are exchanged, no pasts discussed. Only the present matters for these two tortured souls. Their apartment has become a sanctuary where they can come together as one.As the movie progresses, it becomes apparent that Paul and Jeanne are truly falling for each other, but neither is sure how to proceed with the next step. Unsure, Jeanne returns to the arms of her "boyfriend", while Paul struggles with his feelings for Jeanne. Finally, he reveals his true feeling outside of the apartment, professing his love for Jeanne. Will she believe it, or will something happen to shake up the ending?When this film was originally released in 1973, it drew the dreaded "X" rating for the sexuality and language. Somehow, it was reduced to NC-17 for the DVD version. Despite the rating, the movie is still very good. Brando and Schneider are simply marvelous in their roles as Paul and Jeanne. Brando's performance won him an academy award nomination. I had a slight problem with the English subtitles, but it in no way affected how I felt about the movie overall. The plot is extremely well-developed, and the characters fit perfectly into the story. I highly recommend this great film. Watch this movie and see one of Marlon Brando's great film performances.

Those who are well-read in the interviews of ex-band members and related studio guys will instantly recognize many of the quotes in this work, however Sweet does not credit any of the actual sources of these quotes and would lead the less investigative reader to believe he spoke with many of these musicians himself (instead of simply culling the quotes from Modern Drummer or Guitar Player). In that regard it is somewhat of a hack job. The writing style itself is somewhat poor, and there are some embarassing factual errors.

review/text: I have a theory about upward mobility as it exists in a corporate workplace (actually, I've been relaying this theory for so long that I no longer remember if it is my own, or if I've stolen it from someone smarter than I; If it's the latter, I apologize for my thievery). If one is ambitious enough, and good enough at their job, they will get promoted. If they are still ambitious, and good enough at this new job, they will get promoted again. This process continues until said person reaches the limits of their abilities. Then they are promoted one last time, into a job that they can't possibly handle. This is where they stay for the rest of their working lives. I've seen it happen time and time again at my place of work, and it's this kind of sophistic reasoning that gets spoofed so mercilessly -- and so perfectly -- in &quot;Office Space&quot;.Writer/Director Mike Judge has crafted a spot on depiction of office life in the latter part of the twentieth century. Technology has advanced to such a degree that those who fail to understand it are either relegated to being its slaves (a running joke here has a nefarious fax machine tormenting two programmers) or promoted to management. Those in the latter category, made obsolete by technological advancements and having no real duties themselves, are relegated to becoming bothersome micromanagers, in the hopes that their stock rises a quarter of a point. Everyone is worried about job security, and rightly so, for the average worker is about as interchangeable as the coffee machine, and respected less. And anyone with any semblance of a soul is constantly involved in bemoaning the wastefulness of their lives.Peter Gibbons (Ron Livingstone) is one such troubled soul. He's involved in his company's Y2K readiness project (with the benefit of hindsight, the pointlessness of this task is made even more pointed). But he despises his job. Tormented by ennui but hampered by lethargy, he sees no way out. A fateful visit to a career-counseling hypnotist frees him from his shackles, by allowing him to relax into his job. His newfound candidness is, of course, rewarded with a promotion. Livingstone imbues Peter with a bland everymaness that is at once appealing and relatable. He is surrounded by a madcap menagerie of accurately depicted office drones.David Herman (as the unfortunately named Michael Bolton) and Ajay Naidu play Peter's clueless programmer buddies, rebellious enough to constantly plot against the company, but too scared to do anything about it. The three of them share my favourite scene in the movie, when the aforementioned fax machine is smuggled out of the office, and beaten mercilessly with a baseball bat. Judge handles the scene like a hit in a mob movie, or a drive-by shooting, adding aggressive hip-hop music to the soundtrack, to play up the ridiculousness of the situation. The scene is played as horrific, but turns out truly hilarious. Other office citizens include John C. McGinley and Paul Willson, who play gleefully insipid consultants, brought in to give the company an excuse to downsize, and Richard Riehle as a paranoid lifer, whose job may or may not be redundant.The biggest cheers in the cast go to Gary Cole and Stephen Root. The former plays VP Bill Lumbergh. He's every employee's worst nightmare: a lifeless, endlessly droning, boring, malicious, and unimaginative manager. Brought to life through a costume that includes unfashionable glasses, shirts that match collar to cuffs, and an ever-present coffee mug, Lumbergh subtly terrorizes all who serve him with salutations that make him appear interested, but in fact amplifies the apathy he has for his employees. Cole nails Lumbergh perfectly, allowing the man's slime to ooze from every pore. Stephen Root, in the film's showiest role, plays Milton, a milquetoast, asocial, &quot;squirrelly looking guy&quot;. Saddled with coke bottle thick glasses and an inflamed complexion, Milton is the ultimate social outcast. Root gives Milton an under-his-breath lispy voice, easy to overlook. So much so that his repeated threats to &quot;burn the building down&quot; if not granted any respect go unnoticed. The passive aggressive cat and mouse game fought between Lumbergh and Milton over a stapler (!) provide for some of the film's best and most telling moments.Jennifer Aniston, who plays Livingstone's love interest, does fine work with an underwritten role. She brings a kind of quirky restlessness to Joanna the waitress (tormented by a witless boss of her own, played by Mike Judge himself), although her desperation shines through as well (otherwise, why would she torture herself working at a classless establishment as &quot;Chotchkie's&quot;?).&quot;Office Space&quot; will touch a nerve with anyone whose ever worked in a large office. In fact, if you've ever encountered schizophrenic traffic (the film's opening scene follows Peter on his morning commute; he's caught in a hilarious catch-22, as any lane he changes to slows to a stop, just as the lane he's just come from starts to move), been bothered by door-to-door magazine salesmen, gotten zinged by static electricity, or been maligned by any of a dozen other inconveniences of modern urban life, you'll find something here to relate to. And, ultimately, laugh at.

review/text: Okay. You have two movies here that many critics and customers want to compare. We have the original &quot;The Haunting,&quot; impeccably filmed in 1963 in black and white by the talented director Robert Wise. The stars were Julie Harris, Claire Bloom, Richard Johnson and Russ Tamblyn. One cannot help but admit that this version is superior to the remake on a psychological level. Also you can't do better than Ms. Harris or Ms. Bloom. It was a frightening movie and one I remember from my childhood days.Now, on the other hand, here in the 21st Century, we have Jan DeBont's remake of &quot;The Haunting.&quot; Would people have wanted DeBont to do what they did with the remake of &quot;Psycho?&quot; Filmed it exactly? We know how &quot;Psycho&quot; fared, don't we? Anyway, I found the special effects, scenic design, and sound effects mind-boggling and fun. Sure, we see MORE in this film, but is that wrong? If you don't compare the remake to the original, you may have a better time. I was disappointed in Liam Neeson's lifeless performance, and Lili Taylor is no Julie Harris. Owen Wilson was rather annoying in his role, but Catherine Zeta-Jones was the surprise star. Sure, they updated her and made her look like a tart. But what a tasty tart. And along with her incredible beauty, she brings a lot of life and vitality to the spooky surroundings. And weren't Bruce Dern and Marian Seldes a hoot as the creepy caretakers?So, the plot is much different than original, and the ending lacks the psychological/emotional impact of the 1963 version. But I had a good time throughout the movie, and don't think it's fair to compare such different movies. Apples and oranges. But, if you have an open mind a good bowl of popcorn, I think you'll have fun.

review/text: This book is poorly organized and missing essential information. You would be better off with the open source doc, and much better off with another book. I downloaded the book files and got the first set of classes running . Then I made the tiny changes suggested in Chapter 2 and went to my first servlet compile. PROBLEM 1: what and where is the jar necessary to compile? Couldn't find the info in the book, so I did a text search from the Tomcat root on the superclass the compiler was looking for. Aha, .../common/lib/servlet.jar. Then I made the suggested textual change to the JSP file. PROBLEM 2: I made a hard-to-see typo on that one, and learned what a JSP exception looked like. The book didn't cover that eventuality, so back to the web. Searching news groups told me that this was the most common JSP exception, and my installation might be faulty. So I dove into the exception printout, which is pretty opaque, and figured out my mistake. PROBLEM 3: the book says you can use a compressed war file if you &quot;add a new Context entry in ... referencing the apress Web application.&quot; This is not a trivial task and the book gives no other help. After a few hours (!) of online searching and experimenting, I discovered this: 1. No one explains what should go in the &quot;Config URL&quot; slot in the &quot;live&quot; Manager install page in Tomcat 4. 2. If you go the &lt;Context&gt; route in server.xml, the error log in .../logs will probably have all the info you need about what went wrong. Book doesn't say a word about checking this if you run into trouble, but it is the FIRST place to look (OK, I was working tired). Tomcat is actually easier to use than this book.I skimmed the rest of the book after this, then put it down forever. I went out and bought Marty Hall's &quot;More Servlets and JavaServer Pages&quot;, and I think you should too.

review/text: Being a male I was never much of a fan of the chick flick, however I usually just accept that women like these movies for the same reasons that men like horror-gore movies (not to essentialize but not many women appreciate this genre). However after seeing this movie I felt compelled to write a reveiw.Basically the plot is somewhat predictable and horribly cliche; enough people ran through it already so I do not beleive that it is my duty. However the most predictable parts of this movie are when she goes to the Italian lovers house and finds out that he already has a woman under his roof. (Perhaps she should have rode back with the officer and then made this movie at least interesting).It is from the aformentioned point that the movie goes seriously downhill. The author found it neccessarey to give this movie a happy ending and amazingly one fell from the sky, with the American author appearing out of nowhere and the deadfully cheesy out of class relationship with the Polish kid and the Italian girl.Overall I recommend this movie if you can forgive movie cliches and random happy endings; well all of that and of course bad acting and fourth grade directing.The scenery was however beatiful, but what a waste.

review/text: The soundtrack for Disney's Toy Story 2 is simply beyond all my expectations. Pure entertainment. Happy songs and melodies. Here, there and everywhere all over the entire cd, it's very easy to find the most joyful, pleasant and funny tracks possible. They really help you to enjoy and to live the magic of the movie itself as you've never dreamed before. They take you inside the magic. I myself am a fan of Disney movies since childhood and still today I just can't miss not even one release and buy all the soundtracks and other Disney stuff. &quot;Lion King&quot; and &quot;Beauty and the Beast&quot; are my very favorite. Masterpieces. Unforgettable. This particular one has been included in my list too, with honors. For sure, it's a must-buy. Just like the movie that inspired it.

review/text: When E T A Hoffmann redirected his output from music to literature the world gained a lot. Not only did his literature have great impact with other writers, but his stories became the source of much musical inspiration (Wagner, Offenbach, Tchiakovsky, Hindemith, Schumann, Busoni, Delibes .....). But listening to this CD made me realise the world lost a lot as well, because Hoffmann was a very talented composer. I had previously heard some of Hoffmann's chamber music, such as the piano trio and harp quintet on this CD, and viewed them as pleasant but not memorable. The duettini italiani on this disc are for me, a pointer to greater riches in Hoffmann's music than I had previously seen.Other recommendations:Hoffmann's short stories, and his novel 'The Life and Opinions of the Tomcat Murr'E.

review/text: After reading the book I was completely disgusted, the author starts by saying that the Essenes knew more about prayer than the bible Even though the bible says the same things as what points to in the dead sea scrolls then he thinks a group of Hindu's would know even more than the dead sea scrolls say. Though the dead sea scrolls haven't changed in 1,500 years then he makes several extremely obvious errors 1: the Hindus don't teach out of there copies of the dead sea scrolls, 2: If they did learn from the dead sea scrolls they show no evidence for it A: if they did learn anything from it it would have made them think 'well we've learned truths from these Essenes this is making me question my religion.' B: assuming, again, they learned from said scrolls wouldn't the years of teaching generation after generation of those teachings the time passing would have altered the teachings as he says it has for western religion. In fact he never asked them were they learned there method of prayer.Further he often confuses meanings for example we are taught, in the bible, to pray whole heartedly to pray with all thy heart might and mind, while Gregg says pray with your thoughts feelings and emotion aren't the last two the same? YES! they are you feel emotions!Their are better books out there which you not only get what you ask for (if its right) but also sensitize you enough to hear God!Those books are as followsRECEIVING ANSWERS TO OUR PRAYERSPrayers That Bring Miracles

review/text: Intoxicated, I had just finished The Iliad and The Odyssey. I came to the conclusion that I still hold, that Homer is one of the greatest poets of all time, (and to his merit, I deduce this from a translation, and even very good translation saps a massive percentage of goodness from almost any poetry).Then, a few days later, upon entrance into the incandescent crucible of Freshman English class, we started "studying" the Odyssey, and to the stupid pleasure of my classmates, our teacher in her benevolence announced that we would be watching this piece of worthless crap supplementing our piecemeal "study" of the Odyssey. I was skeptical, but I could not have been prepared for the ensuing blasphemy. I am not inclined to waste my time recalling every freakish perversion of plot, travesty of drama as an art form, embarrassment to the special effects crew, and overall mockery of Homer that this film contained, but let it suffice to say that there was not one well done instant in the whole film, not one moment that gave me anything akin the orgasmic mythopoeic thrill I encountered in the poem itself.This is not to say that I did not enjoy the film- far from it. During the few minutes when my head was not hooded and submerged under my desk, during the hilarious moments when my ears were not frantically plugged, I had about as much comic relief to the perdition of high school as a boy can ask for. After hearing Aelous, I relished thoughts of mutilating the "brains" behind this catastrophe. And I suppose I have a soft spot for patently fake gore and cheesy pseudo-Gothic atmospheres of "terror", and the Scylla scene pandered to that. I pretended I was watching Monty Python and the Holy Grail, and enjoyed myself. I LOVE crappy special effects!!I was shocked to learn that this was made in 1997. I truly believed this was made in the 60's.Homer, I praise thee, and maybe I shall avenge thy memory.

review/text: The Triplets of Belleville is a very eccentric movie which I loved. It takes a mature audience to not be completely overwhelmed by the film's sheer genious. But don't let thet scare you! The film is funny, exciting, and totally unlike anything you've ever seen. The soundtrack is even better.With a cool combination of Django Reinhardt guitar, cabaret singing, and french surf music, Ben Charest has managed to create an original collection of music that satisfies all kinds of listeners.The title song of the soundtrack is one of the best (it was deservedly nominated for an oscar), and all the rest of the tracks centralize around it. Sung in tight three part harmony with catchy lyrics (in both french and english), 'the triplets of belleville' songs (there are four total on the cd), are enough to make anybody want to get up and start dancing. Another fun thing about this soundtrack is the presence of source music coming from vaccum cleaners, refrigerators, newpapers, tire wheels and more! (I admit, the vaccum makes more sense if you've seen the movie- so do so!) The singers in the vocal pieces are fantastic, and make up for the lack of dialogue in the film. The instrumental pieces completely set the mood for the wide range of sences the film has- from the tour de france to a gangsters hideout.This is the perfect kind of music for a person wanting to expand their music intake. While listening to this, you get a taste of all kinds of music that are unfortunately underplayed. Hope you enjoy!

review/text: I saw this during the eighties when it originally came out and thought it was terrific and scary. However, this movie does not hold up at all. It's not just the technological advancements in special effects that makes this movie so dated, afterall movies like &quot;The Thing&quot; and &quot;The Exorcist&quot; came out before this. A scary movie is scary no matter when it came out. This movie is just silly. The president's fear of nuclear war is treated so brazenly that it doesn't hold up now that the Day After decade is over. The story is so brisk in the extreme nothing is giving time to develop. Only the ideas are presented and not explored. Quaid and Sydow are good but even they can't save this movie. The dialog is very stilted at parts. Christopher Plummer is just silly, not menacing. Tommy Ray isn't scary any more. The snake man looks so rubbery and stupid that I can't believe I was ever scared of it in the first place. They did a terrible job with it. The transformation effects are now laughable. They didn't have to be. Kate Capshaw is awful (she always was; maybe that's one of the reasons you don't see her in much anymore now that she is married to Spielberg). This is just not that strong a movie and time has not been kind to it. I thought it was great when I was 10 but it just isn't scary or fun. Awful music by Maurice Jarre. Not because it is an electronic eighties keyboard soundtrack like Jerry Goldsmith's Runaway. No this is just bad and it sounds bad on this DVD. No themes develop and even the chase music is boring. Very weak. Similar genre movies from the eighties that hold up and you might want to check out instead: Twilight Zone the Movie, Gremlins, Poltergeist, Brainstorm, Fright Night.DVD-This dvd is also not very good either. The picture quality is very crisp most of the time. There is some wavering in some scenes. The special effects unfortuneately don't benefit from all that detail in picture quality. The worst part is the sound. It comes in DTS and Dolby Digital. It is hardly 5.1 like the box advertises. Occasionally you get some weak directional effects. But for I would say 80% of the movie everything is in the center speaker.The best thing about this DVD is the menus. They were a pleasant surprise. The movie and this DVD were not.

review/text: I still cant believe this book was turned into a movie. Though the movie didn't capture even 5% of the scariest moments in the book. This book could easily change your perspective on UFO's and monsters forever. Despite the fact that this could be John Keels most unpolished work it is perhaps the most ground breaking too.If you are the type of person who can believe that scores of people would frantically contact local authority and the press to foolishly report a rare stork with red eyes then this book isn't for you. A 7-ft leathery gray humanoid with glowing red eyes and a huge wingspan that flies fast enough to chase cars down is not something dozens of people are mistaking for anything else.I almost didn't buy this book years ago when I first heard about it. It just seemed too fantastic. When I finally picked it up I was stunned by all the 1st hand experiences of the author.The first Wednesday after I read the book I looked outside my house for UFOs. An old school Cadillac rolled by and made a turn at the end of my block, which would force it to back track. The windows were black. Nothing else happened. When I got back inside I had a message from my best friend. He was somewhat frantic. He said: "Dude, I just heard a really weird UFO whirring sound outside of my house." His girlfriend heard it too, and she told him in an uncharacteristic manner: "better go tell your friend what just happened" I hadn't told him what I was reading (or anyone else) and I never had a serious discussions about UFO's with him before that event.

review/text: It'll be hard to write this review without including spoilers, but I'll give it a shot.The main problem I had with The Gods Of Mars is its inconsistent depiction of John Carter's intelligence. Carter's supposed to be this brilliant guy, a master strategist, a think-on-his-feet kind of fella who can puzzle his way out of any dilemma, no matter how difficult. So why is it that when he is presented with something so simple as the &quot;mystery&quot; of the identity of one of the major characters, said identity being so glaringly obvious that the reader has it figured out within a paragraph of the character's introduction, it takes Carter SEVERAL CHAPTERS to figure out who this guy is?This inconsistency (not the only one, I'm afraid), isn't really all that bothersome in and of itself, but it's problematic in that it (sin of sins!) takes the reader out of the story. In a novel like The Gods Of Mars, all you've GOT is story. Anything that takes you out of it is therefore a major flaw.I still enjoyed a lot of The Gods Of Mars, and will probably read The Warlord Of Mars (the next book in the series) if for no other reason than to see how TGOM's cliffhanger ending is resolved (yes, I admit it, I wanna find out). I just hope it's an improvement upon its predecessor.

review/text: As the fifth book in the Night World series, 'The Chosen' improves on all four of the previous books, drawing on deeper themes and ideas than the rest, and setting the scene for this continuing trend in the next book 'Soulmate'.Rashel Jordan is only five years old when she witnesses her mother being killed and her younger brother Timmy being drunken from by a vampire. Because she's seen the killer and is telling others about what happened he comes after her when she stays at her Aunt Corinne's house, burning it to the ground. Rashel is alone in the world.At seventeen years old, she is the bane of vampire-kind. Calling herself 'the Cat' she hunts and kills their kind in all of the major cities, and there is a large bounty on her head. At the time this story takes place Rashel goes to the Lancers, a human organisation for killing vampires and joins in with a small group who're watching a warehouse that has been lately occupied by vampires. Their goal is to catch a vampire and discover its reasons for being there - through torture if need be. Among the group is a young girl named Nyala whose sister was killed by a vampire. Yet when the vampire is caught and the others go to scout around, Rashel finds that to her horror she and the vampire - Quinn (last seen in Daughters of Darkness) are soulmates. Letting him go, Rashel finds that she is suddenly wanted by both sides of the fight - the vampires still have a bounty on her head, and the Lancers think she has defected to the other side.And it doesn't end there. While on the run from both of them Rashel literally runs into a young girl Daphne Childs, who is one of the missing young girls of late. With her in tow Rashel has access to exactly what the vampires are up to. For unknown reasons - though Rashel suspects its the slave trade - girls are being abucted from a club known as the Black Iris by none other than Quinn himself. Rashel's mission is clear - get into the club, become one of these 'chosen' and thus get herself to one of the secret and hidden vampire enclaves. And she'll have to do it by herself...As you can see, the premise is a fascinating one, and there is no shortage of interesting characters and ideas. Not all vampires are bad, not all humans are good so it would seem, and there are enough twists and turns, suspence and excitement to keep most people interested. It draws on things mentioned from the other books - the enclave is probably much like the ones Rowan, Kestrel and Jade escaped from in Daughters of Darkness, and the password that Rashel uses with the Lancers 'the night has a thousand eyes/and the day only one' is re-used in the prophesy in book seven. L. J. Smith extends more on her idea and the nature of the Night World than previously seen, and several characters pop up that will have appearences in other books - namely Hunter and Lily Redfern.The 'mission' plot strand gives the book some focus (too often L. J. Smith's work rambles, changes, backtracks or doesn't know where its going) and the pace is fast and never dwindles.However, there are a few flaws, the nature of which keeps this book from being a 'five-star' novel. The character of Nyala was a complicated and intriguing one - a girl who was slightly mentally unstable. I don't want to give too much away, but for those who have read the books, I felt that she should have perished in the fire. Okay, that's not very nice of me, but a good author should know when to destroy a character for greater impact in the book's progression. But no, L.J. Smith simply *had* to save her, didn't she. She just *had* to have yet another happy, cliche-ridden ending that is so prevailent in so many of her books. To have Nyala has a tragic figure would have been both poignant and heartbreaking - *that's* what we should have come away from the book feeling.Secondly, Daphne Child's part in the book is pretty implausible. Let me get this straight - she manages to escape from the jaws of certain death and is saves by pure chance by Rashel. And when she is faced with what she got away with, she wants to...do it again? Huh? Yes, yes, she's very brave about going back to the Night Club and letting herself get kidnapped, but come on! - it was just plain stupid. No one in real life would ever do this to themselves. It was the same when Rashel was at the docks and she turned around to find all the girls still there - face it, they would have run like deer.It also ended very abruptly - we don't know what is to become of Timmy, of the girls, of the enclave...it ends with simply the boat sailing back to the shore. I for one had many unanswered questions, and since each book tells of a totally different couple, they weren't to be found in the next book.Finally, the use of the name 'Timmy', brought back Lassie flashbacks: 'Oh no, Timmy's down the well!' Unfortunatly this meant whenever Timmy turned up I was plauged by visions of him floudering in water.All in all however, a good read. One of L.J.'s more suspenseful, darker works. Highly recommended in the context of the Night World series.But 'Timmy'?...

review/text: This is probably the most highly anticipated record of the past 3 years for me. After stumbling upon "El Cielo" from reading the reviews on Amazon, I thought they were a pretty cool band...little did I realize over the past 3 years Dredg would become my favorite new band of the last 10 years or so.In case you haven't heard Dredg, their sound has been called everything from Emo to Progressive Rock, Hard Rock and Alternative and they probably are all of the above. Gavin's vocals are very distinct and on the higher end of the register and the lyrics are...well in a word, deep. Behind him is a band of talented young musicians that collectively form the nucleus of what is the most exciting thing happening in music today.About 6 weeks ago "Bug Eyes" appeared as a pre-release single on Itunes. I downloaded it, it blew me away and I have not been the same since. Not only is it the record of the year, but its honestly as good as anything thats ever been released in its genre. The lyrics just astound me. Well, that's great and all but I feared the rest of the record would have a hard time living up to "Bug Eyes"...After a few listens I thought this was a good record, but perhaps not great. Slowly, other great songs ("Jamais Vu", "Ode To The Sun" & "Spitshine") started to emerge and the record started to reveal all its intricacies, layers and nuances. Then I started to like how the band was willing to experiment and grow their sound -"Sang Real" & "Zebraskin" and it became evident what a great record this in fact is.The production by Terry Date and the overall engineering deserve kudos as well, as this is a fantastic sounding record- The instruments and vocals were all recorded amazingly well.Record Of The Year and the new standard in Emo/Prog/Hard/Alt Rock.

That means that you cannot expect that a little tinkering will fix it. You have to realize that the entire system needs an overhaul.Lazare makes that point beutifully in his book. His grasp on American history and how the constitution has failed in the past is an eye opening experience. This is required reading for anyone interested in reclaiming thier democracy.

review/text: I tracked down a copy of this movie solely because of J&uuml;rgen Prochnow's presence in it. It's getting some wider distribution lately due to the fact that it's also one of Elizabeth Hurley's earliest movies.This is a fun movie if you like Prochnow, Hurley, or sailing, because most of the movie is set on a beautiful 45-foot (approximate) ocean-going sailboat out in the middle of the Atlantic.Also released under two other titles: Der Skipper (The Skipper) and The Storm. Filmed in English, but the looping is so bad in places that it looks dubbed.Basic plot: Prochnow's best friend (and his wife's lover) drowns at sea during a storm while they two of them are out on a fishing trip. The wife blames Prochnow for her lover's death and leaves him. Prochnow spends the next six months in a drunken haze in Gibraltar, each day saying he's putting out to sea &quot;tomorrow; what's the use in staying here?&quot; Then he meets two young British women (Hurley and Patsy Kensit) who want to go to Barbados. He agrees to take them.Neither woman knows anything about sailing and they refuse to learn, so Prochnow has to do all the work (fortunately, it's a boat that can reasonably be handled by one person). Kensit's character displays a great deal of neurotic-bordering-on-psychotic behavior, and both try, at different times, to seduce the Skipper. Alas, cabin fever also sets in, leading to more neurotic/psychotic behavior.Well-acted by Prochnow (of course), but a bit uneven with Hurley and Kensit.

review/text: The Motorola StarTAC Hands Free Car kit is outstanding. The speaker audio is loud and clear and the microphone pick up crisp. I have had hands free on my previous car phones and it is the &quot;way to go&quot;. The kit is very inclusive and easy to install if you are comfortable with basic electronics and able to take the molding, etc, off your car in order to run the antenna coax, etc. (External antenna is not included but you really need to get one for maximum performance) Anyone who has installed a Ham or CB radio will be right at home. The mounting of the holder for the StarTAC cell phone itself may need some modification or you may want to make a bracket in order to get a neat installation.I would suggest that you mount it as high as possible in order to keep it as close to your driving line of sight for safety concerns. Mine worked flawlessly after a 2-3 hour install in a Ford F-150. Will be mounting one in our Lincoln TC soon. Also suggest that you mount the hands free microphone near the center of the car (near the rear view mirror or center it on the dash) so that a passenger can be heard should they speak. A must have.

Frankly, I cannot recommend a better book for any layperson to read on the subject.If you're interested in Orthodoxy, this is also an excellent book.What makes this book great is that the author himself was a seeker and did not understand these issues. He documents his own exploration beautifully!

review/text: Required reading. Unfortunately Orwell was not obvious enough. 1984 was not a prediction of what was to come. Orwell was writing about what already existed. As I read some reviews and talk to &quot;educated&quot; people, I'm amazed at how many believe that Orwell was not talking about America but rather some &quot;evil&quot; empire like Russia, China or Cuba. Wake up Winston! Big Brother has been alive and well for HUNDREDS of years. Could terrorism be our present &quot;outside threat&quot;? It depends on whether outside means inside. Ask Emperor Clinton. Does sex mean sex? Does Is mean is? Newspeak is here to stay. If you'd like to read something clearly written about government and society look for HOW TO SAVE AMERICA AND THE WORLD: The Elimination of Terrorism, Greed and Other Evils. (Available January 2002)

review/text: This is a wonderful movie, in fact it was so compelling that three hours flew by and I found myself not wanting it to end.Overall it's a quiet film with thoughtful performances and seems to be sincere in its attempt to show the central role of King Ludwig of Bavaria as a very sensitive, sad, ultimately self destructive King who loved art and music more than his throne. Here he is gently underplayed by Berger whose dignified portrayal is one of his best performances.Whether madness or medicine we will never know but our sympathy for this tormented man is enlisted from the start. How much is historically accurate I am not sure but it seems to follow the well known facts and presents them dressed in all the splendour of the day.Visconti strikes the right note from the very start with sumptuous costumes, ultra romantic settings, and beautiful actors - he has a craftsman's grip on his subject and never once does he allow the film to descend into a clich&eacute;d costume drama, nor does the usually irritating dubbing have any detrimental effect on the overall enjoyment of this film - all this accompanied by the strains of Wagner's monumental music and what more could you ask for?The DVD is value for money, picture quality and sound are excellent and there is a bonus disc containing a documentary on Visconti. A must have for any serious movie collection.

review/text: If you are interested in a truly great movie, representative of a historical period of time, early 1900s in China --- this is it!!! The sets, costumes and plot make this a MUST and HAVE TO purchase DVD for anyone who is interested in Chinese culture. Fascinating!!!! Don't be bothered that there are subtitles, they are written well. However, the acting is superb and communicates beyond the Mandarin. This surpasses Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon ten fold for anyone who is interested in a Chinese-made movie that is not merely martial arts. One of the best movies that I have ever seen, equivalent to The Last Emperor. For all ages!!!For technophiles like myself, this is fascinating to watch --- the introduction of photography and moving pictures in China.

review/text: I purchased this set of pans the day after Thanksgiving at 5am. I wanted a nice set of pans and did a lot of research. I found that this set was one of the better sets given the price, it was on sale at Bed Bath & Beyond plus I had a 20% discount coupon that made it all worth it. It also included a Bonus set in which I received a 5QT sauteuse pan w/lid, a 7 qt stockpot w/lid, and a 6 piece spatula/spoon set. I ended up only paying like $200 for everything.I have used this set daily, I have a family of 6 and cook every single day and night. I have a gas stove and wow what a difference in cooking and heating. I had a cheaper set before and it didn't matter how low I had the heat everything burned in the middle of the pan. It's amazing how well everything cooks, I can actually turn the heat up a little more and still nothing burns or sticks even with out oil. I can cook more and better then ever.I like that these pans are really quite heavy but the big 12 inch sauteuse pan has 2 handles and really is easy to hold on to with both handles. I like that the handles don't get hot unless you accidentally touch the metal part up by the pan. I also like that I can see what's cooking inside with the glass lids. You do have to hand wash them but it's real easy to do since everything just wipes out easily. Who has room in their dishwasher anyway for such big pans? I don't even have 1 scratch in them as of yet. Overall I am really glad I was able to purchase this set of pans. I wouldn't trade them for anything.I hope you enjoy them as much as I do!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

review/text: Franco Zefferelli (who made his directorial debut with "The Taming Of The Shrew" and would go on to direct "Jesus Of Nazareth", a mammoth six hour TV miniseries and "Hamlet" starring Mel Gibson, director, producer and co-screenwriter of "The Passion Of The Christ") does an excellent job directing "Romeo And Juliet." This version (and "West Side Story", which is the closest to modern as you should get to Shakespeare) is better than the sh---- modern one directed by Baz Luhrman and starring Leonardo DiCaprio ("TITANIC", a movie which could've been better, but that's another story) and Claire Danes ("Little Women," "Terminator 3: Rise Of The Machines," etc.) Take my word for it, Leonard Whiting and the lovely Olivia Hussey are very believable as the doomed lovers in 15th century Verona, not only given their ages, which made them entirely suitable for the role, but also their acting in this movie. Michael York (who made his acting debut in Zefferell's "The Taming Of The Shrew") plays Tybalt, exuding pure malice, though John Leguizamo didn't do such a bad job, but THAT version was "Fart." 'Twas that bad. Sir Laurence Olivier, considered the greatest Shakespearean actor of his day (watch his 1948 Oscar-winning version of "Hamlet" and you'll know why I agree 100% with that), has an uncredited role as the offscreen Narrator. This version is well-done. Should've won Best Picture. My favorite part is when Juliet says, "It is, it is, high hence begone; away." Olivia Hussey has a great body in this film. Rated PG for brief nudity.

review/text: I was highly disappointed with this cd. Perhaps I expected more of the Kharma era Sanders or any of his early 70's releases. Anyhow I've always experienced Sanders as somewhat of a self indulgent artist even on his best records and in fact some of his best playing really is on other peoples records so in some ways I'm not all that shocked at the medocrity of this cd. The music is bland, overwrought and trite somewhat similiar to any of the faceless and equally uninspired New Age releases that you might stumble upon. This cd should be avoided and if you want to here some more current Sanders check out Sonny Sharrocks album &quot;Ask The Ages&quot; that features Sanders without the pretension and self importance.

review/text: Though IMDb.com raised the sort of factual issues that Hepburn fans would have been expected to have known about, the tenor of this biopic is generally warm. The daughter of a baroness, Hepburn's family is reduced to refugee status by the end of WWII, her father missing and presumed dead. Though living below their station, the Hepburn's are generally sunny about their existence. Audrey makes friends easily, but is a failure as a ballerina. She can't sing or dance, and when she gets her first major gig as Gigi, she can't even act. By then, the script settles on Hepburn's charm as her greatest asset. Never having seen Hepburn act, Collette is nevertheless sold on her stage presence. Actors and directors fawn over her, none knowing of her insecurities or a desire for a future involving a stable family life. Though her star rises further, Hepburn struggles to find that sense of security - eluding her in various misfired or purposelessly sabotaged romances (including one with James Hansen, heir to a fortune and founder of Hansen PLC; also William Holden from "Sabrina"). She turns typically to her mother, who happily enough is a supportive parent - aren't parents normally saddled with the blame in these biopics? Famous names and faces cross Audrey's path, but the story makes her the center of attention everywhere - it seems that there's nobody who can resist her charm. The story climaxes with the "Hollywood Ending" final scene of "Breakfast at Tiffany's", hinting to us that Hepburn finally found her emotional center. (The story doesn't go as far as having an older Hepburn star as the elderly Maid Marian, mourning with Sean Connery over their lost love; nor must we endure Love Hewitt grappling in the dark with Alan Arkin from "Wait until dark".)Love Hewitt manages to sound a lot like Hepburn, but her likeness seems as plagued as those of the other celebrity stand-ins. The makers of this biopic seem painfully aware of how delicate the likenesses are, and they do little to shake up their characters for fear of threatening the resemblance too much. Hewitt's mannerisms seem unconsciously jerky - unlike Hepburn's grace. It's not quite a cutting bio; though perhaps Hepburn doesn't deserve that treatment, a better tribute may just be to kick back with one of her movies. My favorite? "Scharade".

review/text: One warms to this album after hearing it for a few times.In the beginning, it can sound a bit foreign: it is unusual work for any genre of music - but if you can get past your own obstinacy, you begin to hear wonders in the pattern of the music. These songs do not just rise toward their climactic moments; they unfold. One reviewer on this site claims that the music will not hold up to repeat listenings, but I disagree: I took this CD with many others on a week-long vacation, and it never left my discman. And besides, A Love Supreme is cited in hundreds of jazz compendia, and exalted by such well-known critics as Ben Ratliff. It is one thing for a work to be overhyped by the public, but when experienced - and honest - critics hail it as a hallmark of jazz history, you can take that to be the truth. Such is the case with this album. No matter how often you listen, the tracks, given a discerning ear, will constantly reveal new facets of themselves.Does in swing in a way that any lay listener can enjoy? No. Is it slick hard bop, with those all-too-clever chords? No again. But what it is, is a masterpiece in a genre that Coltrane created. Not for nothing is this man listed by Miles Davis's side, even though Coltrane's music wasn't so stylistically facile.

This film was about Kurt's last days and what he did, but it was a terrible thing to watch if your a fan because you get absolutely nothing out of it. Most of the music in the movie was terrible in choice; the only part of this movie that i liked was the very end scene where the ghost climbs out of the body. This movie didn't hold my interest at all; it was wandering, mumbling, eating, avoiding. How could you make a film about Kurt Cobain, the man who made grunge, so terrible? I must say I don't think any fan of Nirvana should watch this.Also the very end of the movie says:In memory ofKurt Cobain1967-1994This movie should not have been in memory of Kurt.

review/text: I have to say this is one case where the movie is better than the book, but that bar was set pretty low. Where the book has barely a plot and nothing of any interest (unless you're a huge HGTV fan), the movie has a slightly more interesting plot by virtue of a protagonist that has just gone through a divorce. Her home has appreciated significantly (which explains better than the book how she has the wealth to buy a Tuscan villa and renovate it). Her friends then sign her onto a gay tour of Tuscany, which could have given the movie some depth ...but evidently was scuttled in favor of more conventional fare. Nothing dooms a film like cowardice.The rest of the movie is about the woman trying to find a new husband while pretending not to. In the end, of course (of course!) she succeeds. This kind of twaddle should embarrass even made-for-TV writers.In the right hands, this revised storyline could have turned into a perfectly decent movie. Unfortunately it is saccharine, utterly predictable and fails even to take advantage of Tuscany's exceptional scenery.

My expectations were smothered, stabbed repeatedly, and left on the floor to die. This is not a good book. Bradbury's writing is incredibly confusing, and some pivotal parts of the story are so removed from the main plot that you can't understand them.Bradbury has a penchant for killing off characters. For example, one character, that changes the life of the main character, is dead 20 pages into the book. If she was burned 'cause she had books, fine, but she got run over by a car. How stupid is that?Pass this one up, and for a real futuristic utopia, try 1984. Just not this.

review/text: Why are you listening to music per se, if you're not listening to THIS! I have no idea why this album doesn't have a full five-star rating. If you're going to put down great music it better be because you're a musician putting out better material. (It may seem like I'm defending this album over a measly half-star but I'm just endorsing it heavily and this is my method.)I made a mistake when I first came across this album during a visit to Seattle because I didn't snatch it up then and there (even though I got to hear the whole album). After a month of futile searches in music stores from Seattle to New Orleans, I decided to make it my first purchase from Amazon when I discovered Amazon had the album in its stock. Yes, this album was musically strong enough for me to endure the hassle and initial misgivings of ordering something over the Internet. While this is not a plug for Amazon, this is a definite plug and testament to the hold and strength of this music after listening to it only once.On that note, this album, the music on it, is evolutionary. This album embodies the future of intelligent DJ mixing. Sure, I think John Digweed's 'Bedrock' is intense and wild after the initial songs on both CD's, but I can still find other DJs who mix in his vein and style, using his approach. I can't say that about Kid Loco's DJ-Kicks album, and neither can you (unless you're listening to something I and the rest of the world hasn't yet heard of). The only other DJ music mix that resembles this effort by Kid Loco is the other DJ-Kicks release by the Thievery Corporation. But they only resemble each other in the intelligence of mixing choices and not in their sound or execution. In my humble and otherwise insignificant opinion, this album by Kid Loco is far more sumptious and haze-inducing than TC's album, but get them both if you can. This is not an endorsement for the DJ-Kicks series, either. These are the only two DJ-Kicks albums I enjoy and listen to with any frequency, even six months after purchase (other DJ-Kicks albums weren't so great).Take my word for it, I listen to a lot of music in general. A lot of good music, too. These albums, especially Kid Loco's, stands out. As for a short description of the music, it's deep, down, and murky, but not at all subterranean since it lifts, is very soulful, is full of epiphany, is completely accessible, and makes you proud to own and share it with others.

review/text: The big boxoffice flop in '03 was 'League of Extraordinary Gentlemen', which was VERY loosely adapted from a comic book by Alan Moore. If you liked the movie or the comic, well, this is ten times better than both of 'em put together! The whole thing takes a 'What if?' look at the original Dracula novel, freely injecting any and everyone Newman can come up with into a great alternate timeline tale. Look for cameos from history and literature, from Sherlock Holmes to the Lone Ranger. Some of these references are oblique, some are blatant (probably for copyright reasons), but really, all that's fun and games, and it wouldn't mean diddly if the plot didn't deliver. And it does! This take on Jack the Ripper in a world of vampires is genuinely creepy at times, and the romance between the leads (A mysterious government operative and a beautiful vampire) works pretty well. I have the short story version of this story, and I think the novel is an even better story, with more plot twists and turns. It's kind of BUSY at times (I mean the book is crammed with plots and subplots) but Mr. Newman somehow keeps it all running smoothly. There are numerous sequels to this, but they aren't nearly as good. If you like tales of Saucy Jack, or if you just got tired of Anne Rice's pretty boy vamps a long time ago, you would probably enjoy this.

In so desiring to learn what the Rabbi had been trying to teach him, Jacob learned that Jesus was the best gift of all. The gift he could give to Jesus was his unflagging love and his mission to do the work of Jesus on earth.This wonderful book is beautifully illustrated and is a delightful teaching tool for all ages.

It will save you a LOT of trouble, especially if you're planning on playing games.The Omega Drivers also add a bunch of useful tweaks that can enhance your video card. For example, RadLinker, which you can access by right clicking your desktop, going to properties &#62; settings &#62; advanced &#62; RadLinker, allows you to overclock your card with a simple slide bar. However, this card is functioning too well at it's current speed for me to risk anything/void the warranty, so I've left mine the way it is.

The combination of high resolution and high contrast ratio makes the images, especially text, appear crisp and sharp, from edge to edge. The color accuracy is also incredible. Colors are vibrant and rich; making it the perfect choice for digital artists. All the colors are well represented, as are shades of grey.The only flaw I see in this model is the lack of adjustability. The height is fixed.DELL LCD monitors are a terrific value and is the only monitor I use, both for work and play. I highly recommend it!

review/text: Ok. I wanted to learn about these techniques because frankly, mind control fascinates (and scares) me. But this book is just HORRIBLE. It is loaded with cryptic, needlessly esoteric psychobabble and complex metaphors as well as thousands of random historical facts about MI6, the CIA, the FBI, Joseph Mengele, African tribesmen, etc all strung together randomly and using no particular time line. He jumps around so much that you wonder if he himself has multiple personalities or wrote this entire book stream-of-consciousness. I am being completely serious! In the very beginning of the book, he defines several mind control terms that will be used throughout each chapter (such as "alter"), but this really does not help the reader along much because the problem is his writing style, which consists mainly of run-on sentences and extremely long-winded paragraphs that make no cognitive sense initially. This book was CLEARLY not edited by a professional. At times it is so densely packed with information that you literally have to read a single sentence 6 or 7 times to infer its meaning. Below is an example of what I am talking about. This is only a PORTION of a single paragraph (not the entire paragraph, which goes on for almost an entire page without a break):"In Illuminati systems these early parts are dehumanized into thinkingthey are gems and crystals. These gems and crystals then "power" theentire mind-control system that is programmed over the following yearsinto the child's mind. The gems are not perceived as alters, so the proxycore wouldn't integrate with what is perceived as an inanimate object.The proxy core is allowed to want to move toward health with a therapist,it is programmed to move toward healing, but to lead the therapist awayfrom the true core. She or he is programmed to believe it is the truecore. The real core & its first splits, which are the gems, are placedhypnotically at the mind's deepest levels--in an area of the mind fewtherapists ever search."How could anyone possibly understand this without some kind of "decoder ring"? This is actually one of the more *simplistic* sections of the book! The whole thing reads like a technical manual. I just don't see the point of being so cryptic if your purpose is to educate people. I honestly don't think I would recommend this book to anyone. Ever.

review/text: This book would have been better if the couples were switched though to tell you the truth I don't understand why Bridig was even in the book, she was extremely irritating. Brodick was also another irritating character, I mean like some kind of wild caveman. I Liked Gillian and Ramsey and think they would have made a better couple. This is her first book where I think she overwrote the male lead. This is the first book I've read by JG that I wasn't crazy about but Gillian, Ramsey, Ian and Judith made up for the shortcoming with this one.

review/text: I bought all paperbacks from the first trio through last book and sat down and read them from beginning to end. I have to conclude that this story was the most disappointing of all of them. Unfortunately for me Sheildbreaker's book was the reason why I force fed some of the other bad ones. This book in paticular is bizzare and inconsistent as far a as plot and environment with respect to the series. In summary, I didn't like the way the other swords played out and I thought the characters were neglected and unengaging. As far as I am concerned this series found a creative niche to add personality and intrigue to all the swords, quite uncommon for this genre surprisingly, however, the plots, stories, chararcters, ideas and action scenes fell well short of a great series let alone good stories. I am sorry, but I cannot recommend this book (or series) to anyone. For what it is worth, Book 2 of swords was the best of them all. In some way, I wish the author could have a do-over with the swords concept. Great ideas, not so good implementation.

review/text: In this day of "Will and Grace," where homoerotic humor has made it to prime time, some people might find it difficult to remember just how tight the closet still was in 1973. As his sparkling-intense "Ziggy Stardust" alter ego, David Bowie didn't just sing songs about outer-space, he was FROM outer space as far as mainstream society was concerned.The magic of this concert is multi-fold. There is the poignancy of its being the last show. The musical mastery that came from a long tour of live playing. Then there is David himself, who as Ziggy Stardust is the embodiment of true freedom and liberation; who emanates the full sphere of his being as both a masculine and feminine individual in one body.Even today there are places in America where a man in makeup risks being beaten to death with rocks. In 1973 there were a lot more of those places; this film captures the full brilliance and courage of of David Bowie's talent as a counterweight to the "normal" of his time, which all too often was nothing more than a thin veil of civilization over a lurking, violent ignorance.

review/text: From what I've heard, this book is far more powerful in the original Spanish, and I can only lament that I don't speak Spanish. I felt that long stretches of the book, such as Colonel Buendia's various revolutions and the chapters dealing with the banana plantation, were great. The elements of magical realism were as touching as they were astonishing. But I never grew unaccustomed to the book's pace, which moves herky-jerky through the decades, sometimes focusing on a single event for pages, then leaping several weeks in a single sentence. In the end, I felt like I hadn't gotten to know a single character. All the people in the book mystified me. Their fears, hopes, and regrets, were lost on me.

review/text: When one is trying to get a basic overall grasp of Greek mythology, it can be an overwhelming and formidable subject, and one can be at a loss for the best place to start. Most books I've found either give too much detail too fast or else are hit-and-miss selections that don't give a very comprehensive introduction. If that's been your experience too, this book could be an excellent solution to your problem. It gives a highly readable thorough introduction without overwhelming you with details. As an introduction to or review of Greek mythology, it is therefore highly recommendable. Although probably aimed primarily at children, I suppose grown-ups too, if not already expert on the subject, won't find it too elementary.

After 25 years of the muscles and ligaments shortening on the one side of the big toe, it helps to achieve some stretch when I am not walking on it. I use it in at night and it does not interfere with my sleeping. It is made of good quality materials and I appreciate the ability to stretch it further by tightening the velcro.

review/text: I am very shocked to see so many reviews with five stars for this novel.It was bad, I mean real bad.Some one gave this to me several years ago, and I tried to read it then but it seemed so silly. I picked it up again thinking maybe I would change my mind (I have done that before). It was just as silly as the first time but I bore with it for the most part though I will admit I did some scanning.Besides the main flat characters, the long juvenile plot, and the horrid dialogue (the women's speech and thoughts are also juvenile) there is very little historical content. And it is over four hundred pages! The time period of the book was supposedly around the 1200's but very little in the book referenced that time period, facts or customs.It read like four hundred pages of romance clich&eacute;, but I suppose some people enjoy that style, and I am not knocking them. I just prefer a bit of substance when I read, and this book does not have any.Truth be told, romances can be a bit like fantasy. However I prefer mine with a touch of reality.

They had to go through lots of trouble to get there! The British had tons of weapons, so they were ready!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Read this book to see if the American soldiers survive the long trip to Ticonderoga.In Guns For General Washington the book takes place in 1775(in Boston). It's very cold outside and it is old in Ticonderoga. Paul Revere is 15 years old. Paul's parents move, but Paul decides to stay and keep the house protected.I give this book a five star ratting because it is very cool and it has lots of description! I would recommend this book to anyone that likes to know about wars and likes action!

review/text: Here's a newsflash:1957: Ella Fitzgerald, jazz's best singer, records the songs of Duke Ellington, jazz's best composer. Duke and Ella never sound better. His orchestra is at its most elegant yet at its most swinging, her voice's is in its best form, so harmonically, rhythmically, and tonally sophisticated. Jazz's greatest event is happening. It is &quot;Ella Fitzgerald Sings the Duke Ellington Songbook,&quot; and it is too great to let pass you by.Alright, this is all true. With Duke's big band behind her, Ella was divine. She was even classier with his suberb small groups. Most of all, it showed both of their eclecticism. Duke was still overlapping rhythms, harmonies, tones, and different musical styles to their most mesmerizing effect. Ella was at her career peak at Verve Records. And for the record: Any of the songwriters she covered in the classic Songbook Series never sounded as awesome. She's the glue that provokes the Ellington Orchestra to outdo themselves once again. Their repertoire of jungle music, unique swing songs, lesser known songs, and more experimental songs is covered, and Ella fits these songs like a lace glove. Part of her incredible genius is her ability to adapt any type of music to her ebullient voice. (On the video of PBS's American Masters special about Ella, listen to her short takes on country and soul in a London Club. Dang!)In comparison to the rest of Ella's stellar career: &quot;Ella Fitzgerald Sings the Duke Ellington Songbook&quot; is her peak. It is the centerpiece in her career's greatest period at Verve Records and the landmark Songbook Series. Of all of them, it's the most jazz-oriented. All of her Songbook albums are first-rate, yet this is the best.And it's also a taste of heaven, too good to let pass you by when you're alive. Get it now.And hey, Chick Webb's orchestra was one of swing's greatest bands, but what if she had spent a part of her career in Duke's orchestra? That might have been even better. And even she didn't, isn't this album more than enough?

review/text: Three American explorers stumble upon a small country they dub Herland that's populated totally by women. For about two thousand years, the women have developed an intelligent, productive, perfect society, and with the entrance of the three men, they begin learning about the world outside their realm. The three men find that the women of Herland are ignorant (to their minds) of sexuality and gender roles, but the women are far ahead of the rest of the world in terms of education, child-rearing, population control, and agriculture. To fulfill their own curiosity and learn more, three women of Herland agree to become married to the three men. Unfortunately one of the men has not been able to overcome his own prejudices about how women ought to behave, and with one act he brings their time in Herland to an end. This fascinating story is decades ahead of most feminist, humanist works, and gives every reader an inspiring vision of how the world could be.

review/text: I very much enjoyed this movie. Unlike some others, I didn't think it was too long, or the English subtitles mysterious, or the Africans shallow. I particularly liked that for once an African character is central to the story, and more than just decoration. Sure, he was "just" the cook, but the extent to which the family came to respect, rely, and TRUST him made him part of them.I won't describe the plot, as that has already been done by many reviewers.Having lived in Kenya, I have to say that the European actors did a fine job with the Swahili, considering they were just memorized lines. Their delivery was natural, with the obvious caveat of the heavy accents. But even so, they all spoke like they understood what they were saying.I also thought this was a most unusual Holocaust movie and, while ever present, the Holocaust is not bashed over the viewer's head. It was a good balance.Furthermore, the characters were all pretty complex; the director could easily have fallen into superficial cliche, but did not. The love between husband and wife is frequently complex and conflicted, and this was illustrated artfully.If you like films about Africa, or complex, real-life type of love stories, or are interested in a virtually unknown aspect of the Haolocaust and WWII, this is your film.

Hassell was there on Terry Riley's original "In C" recording that changed music for all time. He's the first trumpeter with a new sound since Miles. He's deep into it, micro rhythms, polyphony, microtones, electronics everything. THERE IS NO ONE ELSE LIKE HIM. And this is arguably one of the best. Those who think Eno and his ilk invented alternative music should do a little more research, and find out who the real progenitors are.

review/text: I've decided he's too good and too prolific for me to write a brand new review every single time I read one of his books. Discworld currently has 34 titles and every one of them will probably knock your socks off. His mind bubbles and flashes like a boiling pot of electric eels, and I simply can't get enough of his writing.A reviewer has compared him to Geoffrey Chaucer. He reminds me more of Douglas Adams, or perhaps S Morgenstern. Great company, isn't it? He's an extremely skillful and imaginative writer, damn funny, clever and observant to boot. He's also very easy to read. A master of characterization, and if there's anything else you like about reading that I didn't mention here, assume I simply forgot. He's awesome.Another reviewer mentioned Jonathan Swift and PG Wodehouse. Why such hallowed company? Because Pratchett belongs there! Truly, I'm enjoying my quest to read every book in the series. You should do the same, and begin your quest at the library because he's got to be there. He's awesome!Yet another reviewer said Jerome K Jerome meets Lord of the Rings. Yeah, that works too.Why do we, as reviewers, compare authors to other authors? Because it's easier than thinking. In the case of Terry Pratchett, it's probably because we'd otherwise wind up quoting the guy. He's so unique that we just don't know how else to cope with his greatness. Even this paragraph sounds like foamy drool raving, doesn't it? That's how all readers react to Pratchett. Reviewers simply don't have the good sense to keep it to themselves.I could call his writing fantasy, but I could likewise call what Douglas Adams wrote science fiction. In both cases, I wouldn't be wrong, but I'd be neglecting so much and just totally missing the point. A rare few authors transcend a genre to such a degree that you know they're shouting out, loud and proud, a big fat "Bite me!"I love Terry Pratchett's writing, and I completely understand why some folks refer to him as their favorite author. Or favourite, I should say, since we're being British. He's one of those authors that makes you want to grab whoever's in hearing range and start reading passages aloud. I'm simply thrilled that there's such an extremely talented and prolific author who's been working for years without me being aware of him. Now I have much catching up to do, and I will love it.

review/text: I bought the Hydro Greenhouse 2 offline at Toys r Us, as a gift for my girlfriend. I was rather disappointed when I opened it because its incubator case looked nothing like that shown on the box. It was made of flimsy soft plastic which couldn't really hold on to its place, and really made the greenhouse aesthestically less appealing.However, it really worked like it said it would. Its instruction manual had a list of vegetables, herbs or flowers that you could grow (which wasn't mentioned elsewhere), so I'm not sure if other kinds of plants would work. I planted two types of seeds (not included in package) - Livingstone Daisy (which was not on the list) and Marigold. Within 3 days, my marigold seeds sprouted, although the seed packet said that it would take 7 days. Whether this was due to the excellent conditions of hydroponics is unclear. My daisies have yet to sprout, though it's only 5 days and the seed packet said it would take 2 weeks.Overall this is pretty cool. You don't have to water them daily, or even take care of them, the water reservoir does the job for you, and you only have to refill it once a week. You also won't have to worry about weeds or bugs since you can keep it indoors and it's covered up (I had a fly trying to build a next though, thankfully it was too fat to squeeze in the holes!) There's also a year's supply of Nutrients to mix with the water. I wonder if normal fertilizers would work as well, since my area doesn't have refills available.I'll recommend this if you like growing plants but don't like the hassle that comes with it. Highly convenient and delightful to watch your seedlings grow each day! A perfect product if the manufacturers could improve on its incubator casing to make it more sophisticated.

review/text: The Witch of Blackbird Pond, by Elizabeth George SpearReview by a Cutchogue East studentImagine living on the beautiful, tropical Caribbean island of Barbados. Being the Heiress to your grandfather's sugar cane plantation would mean no work, all play. Life would be great, swimming in the warm waters all day, being free to read one of the many books that your Grandfather owns right? You wouldn't have to clean either, with your many slaves. In most homes in the 1600's, a 16 year old would be expected to perform many tasks like cleaning, sewing, and cooking. This is how Kit Tyler's life was, perfectNever in her life did Kit have to do backbreaking work. She would soon find out what it was like on the other side. Due to an unfortunate situation, Kit is forced to leave her home on the Dolphin, and head toward her aunt Rachel and uncle Mathew's home in Connecticut. Kit, and her cousins Marcy and Judith work all day, doing the work that Kit considered slave's work.Everything Kit did was the wrong thing in this house. She was even stirring the soap wrong! She was forbidden to help a sweet old widow named Hanna Tupper with anything because the woman was a Quaker. Kit had gone to see her anyway. Because of this she was accused of being a witch. Hanna Tupper was also accused of witchcraft, but Kit managed to help her get away from the angry mob. Hanna's home was burnt to the ground, so she went to live with the mother of Kit's friend Nat.For anyone that's wondering why this Book is called The Witch of Blackbird Pond, it's because Hanna Tupper lived at the edge of a pond, Blackbird pond. In my opinion, this is a great book. If you like realistic fiction books, or books that take place long ago, than you will love this book too.

The video could be used to teach beginners to classic cross-country ski provided there was an experienced instructor doing narration, otherwise you may put the class to sleep. The footage consists of long and repeated shots of a single skier traditional skiing, to soft almost hypnotic music in the background. The video is somewhat dated in its technique, equipment and filmmaking, and would be hard pressed to compete with modern videos the likes of Warren Miller (Alpine), Christian Begin (Mtn Biking) or xczone (cross-country skiing).

review/text: Like another reviewer of Facing the Extreme, I had just read Krakauer's Into Thin Air and had to read more on mountain climbing. I choose Facing because of the title and because it was about one of &quot;The Seven Summits&quot;.Kocour portrays herself as an accomplished mountianeer, but imho her writing is far from accomplished.I wished the book had included a good map so I could follow the progress of the group up the mounain. I also needed a Dramatis Personae. (I finally wrote-up my own.)I was annoyed as Ms. Kocour's words revealed her over-idealization of the guides and her general contempt for the other climbers (except for her tent-mate). (It would be nice to read a book about the climb written by one of the others; I wonder how they saw her.)Her writing imho is juvenile and, especially disconcerting, are the numerous (unintended, I assume) puns.Still, I'm glad her friends et al encouraged her to write the book and overall I'm glad I read it. I know more about climbing than I did and more about Denali aka Mt. McKinley.Before her next book, and I hope she writes again about her climbs, I hope she will enroll in a good basic writing class; one in which she will Face an Extreme(ly) rigorous teacher!

review/text: After reading Sidney Poitier's recent memoir &quot;Measure of a Man,&quot; interest in this film was rekindled. Does this black and white, 1960's film stand up in these contemporary times? Not only does it stand up, it stands up with a pride and dignity that puts most of today's lame Hollywood efforts to shame!This is a simple story, but it is proof that a simple story, illuminating simple human truths, if told well, can go on to live powerfully in one's memory. A wandering man inadvertendly stumbles onto a convent of nuns who believe that he has been &quot;sent&quot; to build their long awaited church. His better sense tells him to move on. His heart tricks him into staying. A crazy idea gradually transforms into a collective project, and the embodiment of a dream fulfilled. I also like that Poitier's character is so well defined and developed that the fact that he is black and the nuns are white does not factor one bit into the telling of the story. Interestingly, Poitier points out in his memoir that the production of this film oddly anticipated the story it told. The director was given a paltry sum to make the movie, since producers were convinced it would not be successful. Rather than conclude that the budget was too tight, the director carried on, asking the cast and crew to make extraordinary sacrifices, including unpaid rehearsal (in violation of actors' union rules). But such was the faith of those committed to bringing &quot;Lillies of the Field&quot; to screen. Such was the faith portrayed in the film. So, in effect, a wondrous film that simply HAD to find its way to realization. Great for the whole family in an era of aggressively marketed trash.

review/text: 20th Century Masters - The Millennium Collection: The Best of the Everly Brothers is a budget priced album geared toward the casual fan who just wants a small sampling of what these guys could really do! The sound quality is quite good and the artwork is about par for this CD series.The CD starts off with The Everly Brothers doing great on "Bye Bye Love;" this was one of their greatest early rock and roll hits ever and it's no wonder why! They sing wonderfully; and the guitar arrangement sounds just perfect. They handle the tempo changes very well and I always enjoy "Bye Bye Love" even though it's a melancholy song! "Wake Up Little Susie" is a peppy little ballad that gets the royal treatment from The Everly Brothers; they sing wonderfully of how their late night date lasted a bit longer than they promised her parents it would. Again, the guitar work on "Wake Up Little Susie" is truly excellent."All I Have To Do Is Dream" features the brothers performing beautifully on a more romantic, slow dance ballad and they never miss a beat! The Everly brothers had great sets of pipes and this number proves it! "Devoted To You" is another love song with a slow tempo that is perfect for dancing with your sweetheart late at night all alone in your living room. Great!"Let It Be Me" showcases The Everly Brothers singing so sweetly of love and a love they have for their girlfriends; they harmonize to perfection and the strings work well for "Let It be Me." "Cathy's Clown" is another highlight of this album; The Everly Brothers deliver this with panache and I am very impressed! "Cathy's Clown" is a very solid number.The album ends with The Everly Brothers performing what sounds like a more recent ballad entitled "On The Wings Of A Nightingale." "On The Wings Of A Nightingale" shines brightly as they deliver this number with all their hearts and souls.Overall, this is an excellent primer for those who want to know just how great The Everly Brothers really were. I highly recommend this CD for the casual fan and newcomers to The Everly Brothers. More diehard fans will want something more substantial; and that's why this cannot be a four star review.

review/text: i must confess that I have always been more than a little disturbed by the cover of this book. The stories featured in this book by Gogol deal with the desperate lives of the St Petersburg bureaucrats, Gogol was one and these are his people! The best story is &quot;The Diary of a Madman&quot; and this deals with the adventures of one of these low grade civil servants who finds his plans and dreams continually frustrated. As a way out he gradually becomes convinced that he is destined for &quot;bigger and better things&quot; (I will not reveal more here, but will leave this to those who will discover just what this is by reading the story). In his delusion, Gogol uses the technique of dislocation to describe the further adventures of his hapless hero and rarely is it used with greater comic effect. Tolstoy was a master of this literary device,particularly when he wanted to satirize something of which he disapproved, but Gogol perfected it. If one wants to see the beginnings of a rich tradition of humor in Russian literature, one cannot do any better than this book. I still dislike the cover and believe that the editors of Penguin may be turning away more business than they generate by the rather off-putting artwork.

review/text: Rosemary's Baby is satanic good fun. This is one of the most impressive horror film's I've ever seen in my life and may be my favorite horror movie of all time. Roman Polanski's Rosemary's Baby is extremely ahead of it's time with the use of strange dream sequences, experimental cinematography and truely disturbing subject matter. Mia Farrow's performance is amazing to say the least and she has cemented her role as one of my favorite actesses of all time. Not much blood or gore in this movie but focuses on it's acting and satanic vibe to scare viewers......and it does! This is an amazing movie I recommend to anyone who has not seen it, GO BUY IT NOW!

review/text: I do not think I am exagerating when I write that this woman has created an empire in which she is enabling people to become seriously overweight and possible worse health problems. This woman adds fat, additives, and perservatives when there is not need at all. For example, she adds mayonnaise to store bought salad dressing, basically for no reason. But most of all, she is advocating that packaged foods are the way to go. That is simply not good. The human body is meant meant to take in the amounts of chemicals that are contained in her recipes. Check the labels; if you see chemicals, don't eat it! If you care about your health, you will stay clear of Sandra Lee.

review/text: I'm a pediatrician, and I did not receive any training during residency on normal infant sleep patterns. I wish I had read this book ten years ago.Dr. Weissbluth explains in a respectful tone why sleep is so important and what happens biochemically to a non-sleeping baby. It isn't always obvious to every parent that the baby needs a sleep schedule . . . this book explains not only WHY a schedule is so important, but HOW to get the baby started on one. It took a little while for my (then five month old) daughter to catch up on her sleep, and now, at nine months, she sleeps 16 out of 24 hours -- 13 hours at night plus two naps. The book is informative but not preachy. No gimmicks, just science. He endorses both "cry it out" and "soothe to sleep" techniques, discussing the merits of each, and is supportive of either crib sleeping or co-sleeping -- whatever works best for your family and parenting style. Like many self-help books, "personal stories" are included in the text, but unlike most self-help books, the stories are used to illustrate a point and not simply to self-congratulate the author. After reading four other sleep books, I've finally found the one book I can confidently recommend to my patients and my mommy friends!

review/text: American photographer Lauren Greenfield's recent exhibition is entitled "Girl Culture". The artist's stunning documentary photographs are prompting comparisons to other female photographers such as Tina Barney and Nan Goldin.Like Barney, also a documentarist of the social realms of contemporary America, Greenfield painstakingly monitors subtle variations of self-representation, made congruent with commonly accepted ideals at the earliest possible stage in a person's development. The rites Greenfield are watching are those of the common girl. In this way, "Girl Culture" presents the opposite of the body-hiding conventions of Barney's East Coast WASPs. Greenfield focuses on the procedures of preparing and presenting the body in a body-fixated mass culture."Girl Just Want to Have Fun" springs to mind as a disturbing euphemism for living the life of a little girl, an adolescent, or a grown woman in the United States today. Oscillating between overeating, starving, and self-mutilation, these girls become conditioned at an early age (even as young as four) by dressing up (and looking frighteningly grown-up) in a brutally competitive environment filled with drastic misconceptions of beauty.The radical affirmation of the standardized ideal sometimes results in travesty, such as when we look through the photographer's eyes at both Las Vegas showgirls and minors wearing too much makeup. Greenfield knows her craft. Her eye is never hurtful or brutally revealing, but instead allows her subjects to present themselves the way they like, the way they live - knowing that the production of the self in front of the camera can be more revealing than any pose the photographer suggests.Beauty, for most of these girls and women, is used as a weapon. It seems to grant self-esteem and acceptance. The outer appearance supports and covers the self simultaneously until the individual is no longer indistinguishable from the masses, until it seems to blend in smoothly. The American body is a body for the masses that results in mass display of the manipulated, operated, augmented body on such ritual occasions as pageants and spring breaks. Greenfield shows the way that these rituals conceal a rigid subtext of pain, suppression, and denial.Remarkable is the sheer absence of men in all of these scenes. With the exception of a spring ritual, in which a group of men hold up a woman like a broken Barbie doll, they are almost invisible. They occupy the women's fantasies, their longings, their projections. Thus, they are included in every picture that Greenfield takes, with a girl culture unfolding in front of the backdrop of dominant male culture. In this respect, Greenfield's seemingly objective photography contains a tangiable, important critique. (Written by Magdalena Kroner)

review/text: As I write this I must say that Ernest's review is better than anything I can probably say, and I agree with most of his opinions. Yes, this film is slow; it is about the characters, and character development takes longer than slashing or gore. This won't fit a lot of Americans' concepts of horror movies: there is no monster, human or supernatural; there is no slashing or teen sex -- no teens at all, for that matter; and the ghosts of the dead children are not overtly threatening, but instead rather sad; there are not even "gotcha" moments such as those in Dark Water or The Grudge. It is, however, an intensely fascinating movie for fans of psychological horror, and those who have an interest in the dark side of the human psyche. I don't feel a need to describe the plot, because others have done that. This movie does give us a new kind of horror, one rarely seen in Asian films and almost never in American horror films since the 1960s. For American film fans, let me say that if you liked the original, black and white, early 60s "The Haunting" (based on Shirley Jackson's book "The Haunting of Hill House") you will probably enjoy this. The films are vastly different on the surface, but in the final say, they both focus on the human rather than the supernatural, and use the supernatural as a means to explore the human condition. It's well worth watching, and for fans of Asian horror, definitely worth owning.

review/text: This is a fine table saw. It's easy to set up, smooth running, stable and sturdy, and it's easy on the back as it rolls on sturdy wheels. The few quibbles that I have are relatively minor and since the saw is new I may find other solutions over time. First, the fence adjustment is not as easy as it sounds and the manual is severely lacking in information. There are 4 allen screws on top of the fence and not two as the manual states. I had to play hit or miss to make the fence parallel to the blade. The scale layout for the fence is very ambiguous even with the magnifier. The centimeter scale is seen better than the inch one. The fence lock and adjustment is better on the Dewalt 10"; I like their rotating knob adjustment. Now the good stuff. The table itself is firm and steady and ready to rip full sheets of plywood. With the blade recessed I use it as workbench for sanding etc. because it is so big and steady. The table extension is great. The blade goes up and down smoothly and easily and the best part is the smoothness of the motor. It's quiet and strong and goes through 4x4 pressure treated stock like butter; hardwoods too. And the brake works perfectly. I haven't tried the miter guage yet so I can't comment but with minor tweaking this could be the best and smoothest portable on the market. Oh, and best of all I got this saw for under $500 with free shipping from Tyler Tool. What a deal.After using this saw for a while I want to downgrade it for several reasons mostly the fence. The adjustment is haphazard and inaccurate and does not stay square to the blade when clamped. I see no way to remedy the problem. The Dewalt has a great fence adjustment and tightening system but the table is too small for sheet goods. Also the blade insert is not stable and is hard or impossible to get to sit flat on all sides and the blade cannot be adjusted parallel to the table. All in all the saw has much promise but fails to fulfill in all the important ways.After having this saw for two years I need to downgrade it to one star. It is absolute crap. From the fence to the plastic gears to the bevel adjustment, this saw is junk. I have broken teeth on the bevel gear twice. The gears to the blade height must be cleaned almost every day. The fence adjustment makes squaring next to impossible. I could go on. DO NOT BUY THIS SAW.

review/text: I purchased this product about two weeks ago at a dept store. I didn't want to pay $150 for a chemical peel, so I was pleased to find this product.The product didn't seem very strong during the first 20 applications. So, I began shaking the container while closed to mix around the contents, before using the product. After that, the applications seemed stronger. Not sure if there's a scientific reason why that was the case, but I'd recommend it, if you want to get the most out of this product. It also didn't seem like the applications were doing much, so I doubled up. Two applications at night. Not sure if that's recommended. I must have tough skin, so there were no bad side effects. Sometimes a slight burning upon application, but nothing that caused me concern.As far as the results, I think my pores look smaller and the fine lines around my eyes (crow's feet) look a little less noticeable. As well, my skin tone looks a bit brighter. There's been a little bit of a break out, but very minimal.I'm 48 and have freckles and some dark spots on my face. I was hoping this would remove it or improve it, but there has only been a slight improvement.I will likely use this product again in the future and would recommend it to friends.

review/text: I can't vouch for the quality of the actual DVD, because I received a blank disc. (I sent it back for a refund.) However, based on the packaging - or lack of it - I would be inclined to agree with David A. Medzorian's assessment that this is an unauthorized bootleg. There was no cover insert - just a clear plastic jewel box in which the disc was placed - and the label looked like a "print-at-home" job. If this is a "print-on-demand" DVD, that wasn't disclosed in the product description. For $19.95, I expected a professional package, and (blank DVD notwithstanding) I didn't get one.If the packaging is this skimpy, it's reasonable for me to believe Mr. Medzorian's comments on the picture quality are accurate. This is not worth your time - or your money.

review/text: All novels of Vatican misdeeds follow a tried and true cast of characters, and formula. The good Pope v. the bad Secretary of State; the Pope's confidant - a good priest on the verge of loosing his faith; the conflicted journalist, in this case doing double-duty as the romantic interest (a knock-out, as usual;) and the well placed allies and adversaries of the above, doing battle for the heart and soul of a Church steeped in mystery and locked in crisis - "The Third Secret," is no different.The book's opening chapter, a re-telling of the Blessed Virgin's appearances at Fatima is so poorly written (third grade level,) I almost gave the book a toss, but as a true fan of the genre I decided to persevere. I'm glad I did, because Mr. Berry has constructed a page-turner.Though the characters are stock, Mr. Berry has filled them out enough beyond clich&eacute; to make them interesting. If they aren't three dimensional, they are at least 2 dimensional - good enough for a pot-boiler. The villains aren't completely villainous; and the good guys suffer enough turmoil and doubt to ground them.Mr. Berry is well steeped in the inner workings of the Vatican, and gives new twists to the life of the Curia, the politics of the Church's princes, and the mechanics of papal ascension.The plot takes some interesting turns as it revolves around the unveiling of a hitherto missing portion of the third secret of Fatima, hence the title. The secret has caused Pope's to tremble, and if revealed will shake the Church to its foundations. Without giving anything away, suffice it to say the Virgin Lady anticipated today's culture wars, and decided to side with the ultra-left wing of Catholicism. The message turns out to be even more laughable than the jokes that it has inspired through the years, and unfortunately for the novel, suspension of disbelief goes right out the window as soon as the secret is revealed. A pity, because I thought Mr. Berry was on to something bigger than a wish-list of ultra-liberal fantasies."The Third Secret," is a good beach, or airplane read - perfect for the summer - a cut above "Angels and Demons," though most everything is; but, because of its d&eacute;nouement, as unsuccessful as any other title in the genre.

A small town girl wants to be a songwritter so she sets her sights on the big city of NY to try and make it big. problem is in NY its who you know and she knows no one. After her low rent apartment is robbed she stays determined and gets the only job she thinks she can get which is the hot bar called Coyote Ugly. The bar is the complete opposite of her as instead of her being shy, she has to act spontanious and wild. won't get all in the details but pretty much leads to her finding the perfect guy, accepted by her father to live her dreams, and well, find her dreams. A movie to definately check out since it has the tenderness for the women and the girls dancing naughty for the guys.

review/text: This surprisingly stunning movie was really just something I rented, because I had seen everything else. I needed to watch a good movie, and not the commercial junk with overated computer graphics. Then I saw this one. They only had one copy of this movie in the store, so I thought that this would have to be a low-budget movie. &quot;Why the heck not&quot; I said to myself, and picked it up.I've never regreted that choice in all my life.What struck me, was an action movie with a poetic heart. In all the excellent shooting, there is an &quot;in between the lines&quot; essence of the beauty of life, portrayed differently in the many characters in the movie. Good acting by some, great acting by most. Ice-T does a good job playing the &quot;bad guy&quot;, and I'm tempted to say that this is one of Christopher Lamberts finest pieces of work.The ending of the movie, will probably disappoint some, but look between the lines here too, and also here you'll find that everything about this movie wreaks of excellence. You'll actually probably also come to the conclusion that the movie couldn't have ended better. This one is a true classic, and I am surprised it didn't get more storm than it got on its release. Well, let me just uproar a storm, and tell you to watch this movie. Action, humour, drama, heck it's got it all, and then some. Highly recommended warm hearted action movie!

review/text: When you first get these, you will realize that they are WAY BIGGER than they should be & assume they have made a mistake. But then, when you wash them, they will shrink into TINY kids looking clothes. I washed these in cold water, did not put in dryer, yet they shrunk about 4 to 5 sizes. I also washed in a gentle cycle, yet the seams look they are starting to fall apart and lint sticks all over them & they come out of the machine FULL OF WRINKLES..so basically after the first wash they are garbage...so unless you plan on having your PJ's dry cleaned, I wouldn't waste my money on these, they were cozy & comfortable at first (although when they arrive they will be WAY TO BIG) but once they make contact with water they are ruined (even though it says they can be machine washed & dried) I can't imagine if I had put them in the dryer, they would probably turn into doll clothes, save your money & buy the cheaper satin version, at leat they don't get ruined in the wash.

review/text: Dierks is OK, decent even, but he's not progressing enough...it's more of the same. This is fine with many artists, but Dierks is not ALTERNATIVE enough, if at all. He's tried to play both sides of the fence on his last 2 records...mainstream and alt-country, and it's getting old. Be one or the other, and it seems he's leaning more on the mainstream side on this new album, which I don't like. I HATE mainstream country, there's no edge, no real ROCK & ROLL in it, and it's tailormade for radio, and I can't stand mainstream country radio. On this record, it seems the label is trying to mold Dierks into being all mainstream. No way man, he blew it this time. He doesn't have enough of an inner hunger or independent streak. If anything, one new country record out this week that blows this one away is Vince Gill's new 4CD extravaganza of 43 NEW SONGS!!! Each disc focuses on a distinct style: catchy rock, southern soul/blues, traditional country, and acoustic/bluegrass. Vince wrote or co-wrote all the songs, plays lead guitar on all of them, co-produced it all, and he doesn't give a damn about having a hit single, ie it's not COMMERCIAL, and he's true to his art and his strengths, which is more important and makes Vince kind of alternative...Dierks should follow this path and defy what his label wants...independent alternative artistry is more important than hit singles, which are actually detrimental to any career, as they put artists into a box. Dierks CAN break the mold and escape this mentality, while there's still time...we'll see...nice packaging on the limited edition though...

review/text: I wasn't sure what to expect from Call of the Canyon. I've download a lot of free titles to my Kindle, assuming that most are going to be terrible. This was a pleasant surprise! Not knowing much about the author or the period in which this book was written, I eventually determined that it was likely to be written around the same time period of the story. The biggest give-away to me was the at-times lengthy social commentary, which I could have done with less of. Not that I agree nor disagree with the sentiments shared by the author, the way it was handled felt a little out of place.I will also add that I found myself skimming the lengthy descriptions of Arizona, mostly because I've never been and some of the imagery was a little hard for me to visualize. They say a picture is worth a thousand words, and I definitely feel like that applies here.Overall, it was a great love story (which I admit I am a sucker for) that was hard for me to put down, and at the end, I wished it would continue. Because of that, I've already downloaded a handful of other works by Zane Grey to read.

review/text: Caroline Reynolds's "Spiritual Fitness" changes lives. Amazingly, it speaks just as powerfully to me, a 30-year veteran of "human potential" and "spiritual growth" books and workshops who thought she'd read it all, as it would to a neophyte. If you do the simple exercises at the end of each chapter, your life is almost guaranteed to change for the better. But even readers who don't do the homework will find the book uplifting and rewarding. It's easy to read yet profound at the same time.As a woman in a major life transition, I find this book a wonderful companion on my journey of personal growth and change, as it confirms and validates my own intuition and sense of the Truth. One term that especially resonated with me but with which I was previously unfamiliar is "non-alignment fatigue," describing that drain of energy that comes when one is with companions whose emotions are different from our own. Caroline makes it OK to trust our intuition and offers exercises to fine-tune our ability to listen to it. I highly recommend this book!

review/text: Verdi's creative genius must have been running white hot when he composed this lovely poignant masterpiece and not surprisingly it has remained one of the world's favourite operas ever since. However, it requires a sympathetic sensitive approach for any production to do its treasures full justice. This recording of a live performance, in the venue where the opera originally received its premier, certainly meets the challenge! Indeed I found the entire production quite exceptional.Central to this success is Edita Gruberov&aacute;'s outstanding performance. Whether being enchanting and beautiful at her soir&eacute;e in Act 1, or distraught and appealing in Act 2, through to the difficulties of the ending in Act 3, musically, vocally and dramatically she is absolutely superb. Her lovely bright soprano takes on wonderful subtle shades of tone and her controlled pianissimo is at times unbelievable. Hers is no mere role, she is Violetta.Her fellow principles are scarcely less admirable. Arguably Verdi gives the elder Germont some of the best arias in the opera and Giorgio Zancanaro makes the most of these. A commanding presence on stage, his powerful rich baritone provides the perfect foil for the diva, matching her for artistry and depth of feeling. Together in scene one of Act 2, they produce, what is perhaps the highlight of the opera for me. I find myself replaying it time and again, yet still finding some new subtle nuance previously overlooked.Neil Schicoff as Alfredo is also in fine voice, but vocally he may lack a little of the finesse constantly exhibited by his fellow principles. Also, to be really nit picky, I found his tendency to sweat under the lights a tad distracting. That being said, his acting is up there on the same exalted plain as the others.Conductor Carlo Rizzi draws splendid playing from the resident orchestra in nice balance with the vocal lines. He is spacious in the lyrical passages, whilst making the most of Verdi's exciting rhythms to drive the more dramatic passages.Verdi's choruses are always an integral part of his attraction and in this production they will surely not disappoint. Oh yes, and there is a little makeweight in the form of a delightful cameo ballet appearance by Gabrielle Brown in Act 2, scene 2.The atmosphere created by the Teatro la Fenice, together with the simple but well designed sets and colourful costumes are all part of the production's overall charm. As with all such recordings one catches a few extraneous sounds and audience noise, but this never becomes too intrusive; neither is the spontaneous applause after some of the major arias. Indeed one feels like joining in.I am aware that there are several versions of this opera available, but I am not in a position to make comparisons as this is the only one I have experienced. However, I feel it would take the harshest possible critic to find too much at fault with this one. Personally I am really enthusiastic about this DVD. In fact I absolutely love it and if I could award it more than five stars I would not hesitate to do so.

review/text: This package contains all six episodes from the first season of ABC's hit sitcom THREE'S COMPANY. It premiered on March 15,1977 starring the late John Ritter as Jack Tripper,a young handsome aspiring chef who was then studying the culinary arts. Joyce DeWitt is Janet Wood,a brunette beauty who works in a flower shop and Suzanne Somers as blonde beauty Chrissy Snow who immediately interests Jack in many ways. Supporting cast members are the late Audra Lindley as Helen Roper and the late Norman Fell as Helen's husband Stanley. Stanley and Helen are the trio's landlords. In the first episode,Jack is asleep in the bathtub following a drinking binge from a party given by Janet and Chrissy the previous evening. The party was for Eleanor,Jack's predecessor in apartment 201. Eleanor had gotten married and given birth to a seven-pound and nine-ounce baby boy. So after Jack cooks a delicious breakfast for Janet and Chrissy,they invite him to be their new roommate. When Jack introduces himself to the Ropers,who live directly below the trio,he tells them he's moving in. But Stanley strongly denies until Janet told him Jack was gay(Stanley could never fathom a straight male platonically living with two straight women). In episode #2,Jack arrives with his belongings via taxicab from the YMCA where he previously resided,to apartment 201. He rings the bell,but instead of a chime he hears Stanley reacting to the electricity immersing in him as he was fixing the doorbell. Chrissy's mother came to L.A. for a dentist's appointment and planned to stay at the apartment. She sleeps in what would become Jack's bedroom and Jack sleeps on the couch(Jack would do that whenever there were house guests). In episode #3,it's Chrissy's birthday and the trio would celebrate amongst themselves. Stanley's young beautiful niece Karen is staying with the Ropers and Stanley pays Jack $50 to take her out despite Stanley believes Jack is gay. Jack promised the date would only last 20 minutes and he would come back home in time for the birthday celebration. Janet and Chrissy are furious with Jack. On the date,Jack who drives Stanley's car,had some trouble with it. It overheated on the freeway. He uses the $50 to reclaim the cameo Janet had hocked a while back for rent money. Jack and Karen are kissing in the Ropers' apartment and when the Ropers awake,Stanley catches Jack and Karen and immediately evicts him from apartment 201("He was acting normal,that's sick!"). The eviction is cancelled after Karen,according to Stanley,practically attacked Jack and he showed no interest. In episode #4,Jack brings home a puppy,unaware that pets are forbidden in the apartment. Richard Kline as Larry Dallas,makes his first appearance on the show. Jack owed Larry $25 and Jack took the puppy to cancel the debt. Larry would later become Jack's best friend and the trio's upstairs neighbor. The trio parents the dog until Helen takes it in. A sleepwalking Chrissy planted the dog on the Ropers' doorstep. Helen declares the dog an anniversary present from Stanley. In episode #5,the trio redecorate the apartment and take a break to go to the neighborhood pub,the Regal Beagle,first seen in episode #2. There,at the bar are two guys and one of them takes interest in Chrissy. Chrissy feels harassed by the guy. He overhears Jack telling Janet and Chrissy that men are naturally stronger than women. He,the "creep",finds a "man" in the joint,Stanley. The "creep" accidentally spills Stanley's brandy and asks the bartender to give Stanley another one. Later Jack finally gets tough with the creep and for his(Jack's) so-called heroism,is given an on-the-house shot of whiskey. The creep harassed both Janet and Chrissy. In episode #6,Janet and Chrissy are out $300 in back rent money. Thinking the money was stolen,they call the police. Jack tries to get $300 from the financial aid department at his college and is denied. Janet and Chrissy don't realize until the end,that they had already paid the rent. Stanley naturally took the money,in an envelope with the word 'rent' on it, while doing a repair job. But he failed to leave a receipt indicating he received the payment(the tenant's/s' copy was still attached to his receipt book!).

review/text: Steve Miller is probably the world's most underated guitarist. He is also very underated as an artist. Your Saving Grace is no exception. The title track is heavy with emotion and while not writen by Miller, shows off the talent of Tim Davis who was the backbone of the early stuff. The forcefull lovesong &quot;Little Girl&quot; and the civil rights motif &quot;Don't you let nobody&quot; are solid rock tracks with a hint of blues and a lot of attitude. &quot;Baby's House&quot; shows off the piano skills of Nicky Hopkins as well as Miller's strength as a vocalist. If you have Miller's box set you are missing out on the full version of this awesome song. &quot;Motherless Children&quot; has a blues twing and a solid emotional base that makes it a classic. While the album is short, it is a good buy. For the Miller enthusist it is well worth it. If not, you might want to start off his early stuff with Antholgy.

review/text: Please don't be duped by the ad hominem arguments of the negative reviews against the person of John Douglas. They tell you NOTHING about this book. Read it and make up your own mind. Seriously, the "disagreements" (they don't even rise to the dignity of being called disagreements but I have to call them something) are based on prejudiced condemnations of Jonbenet's parents. Their arguments are inductive conspiracy-like nonsense that want answers where there are none. They claim Douglas is arrogant. Defending one's self is not arrogant but even if it were, so what? One can be arrogant and right at the same time. Also arrogance is an inflated view of one's self, read the book, his estimations of his own abilities are backed up by facts and an overall authoritative countenance. I bought this book not caring at all about the Jonbenet Ramsey case, I knew only a little more about John Douglas having read "Mindhunter" and enjoyed it. His arguments absolving Jon Ramsey are practically air tight and his defense of Patsy leaves his (Douglas's) opponents looking very foolish. He even starts the chapter defending himself against the ridiculous claims that you can read right here on Amazon; read the eight lame one star reviews that are currently on here and try not to laugh.The reason why I picked the book up was for the Jack the Ripper case thinking that applying criminal psychological profiling could be an interesting approach. I have never burned through a book faster. I mention in my reviews frequently that I have ADD and dyslexia and I don't want to keep beating that drum but it means a lot to me to read a book that keeps my attention. I have a friend at work who never reads and when I let him read it he could not put it down either. Truly a gratifying experience to read this. His conclusions are responsible, he will say when profiling does not give answers and in the case of the Zodiac he deliberately withholds the name of his primary suspect for just that reason. If you are familiar with these cases already you probably can go to a book store and skim this because he assumes you don't know everything about the cases so seasoned veterans of the subject have some things to gain but may be bored with his historical approach. His conclusion on Jack the Ripper is very compelling and is just part of a really well written book. I envy you if you know little about these cases and this is your introduction you are in for a Hell of a ride. Very, very good read, enjoy!

review/text: The authors who understand the subject really well are able to explain it in simple and easy to understand language. This is what I feel that this book is all about. The author explains the economy in one lesson: policies should take into consideration the long-term consequences as well as short-term, and they should consider the effects on all groups, not just few. Wow, so simple, but unfortunately this is not how our policy makers think.I think that high school students should read this book before they enroll in economic courses that bore them to death with all the graphs and mathematical calculations. I really appreciate that this book is simple but to the point - even junior high school students would understand it.

Mireille Mentre has managed to strike an impressive balance between descriptive text, academic discussion, and outstanding photography. While the organization of the book as a whole suffers slightly from what appears to be the publication of parts of an excellent doctoral dissertation, anyone interested in the history of medieval Spanish illumination (especially members of organizations like the Society for Creative Anachronism) would do well to add this text to their library.

review/text: Review of the Box Set: 2 starsBut for now, I'm reviewing this box set. I can't speak for everyone, but in the box set that I received, the pages in every last book were frayed and uneven, as though they'd been cut with crayola scissors by someone with a very unsteady hand. If you can, get the books from some other source.I really like these books, so this was a -major- letdown to me.Review of Mere Christianity: 4 starsI had to get to this book eventually. In apologetics circles, it's considered a classic. Strong-worded enough to be assertive, and yet still vague enough that it can be used by both Catholics and protestants alike to defend their faith.I have to say straight-out that I consider most of this book to be a masterpiece, even though I generally balk at anything even the slightest bit vague. I had a few issues with the book from time to time, but none of them is anything major, and I can deal with them quickly in just a few paragraphs, while also covering the stuff I particularly liked.Lewis is as much of, if not more of a popularizer than he is a theologian, so his prose and patterns of speech are nice and casual; usually easy to read, even when dealing with very complex subjects.He first talks about natural law, the difference between right and wrong, and the reason for that difference. No disagreements here. Next, he discusses conceptions of God and our relationship with him. Still no complaints. Lewis is frequently amusing throughout these parts, as well as edifying. Many of his comparisons are obviously intended to be humorous, while still being entirely true and correct.Next, he gets into the meat of morality, and several key sins, such as sins against the virtues, social morality, sexual morality, offenses against marraige and so forth. All good and important topics. The one problem I have here is that he describes sexual immorality as one of the "least bad" sins. It's not. In fact, it can be one of the most dangerous mortal sins, not because of its inherent severity, but because of its inherent draw, and the complexity of the issue, which often makes it hard to comprehend why it's wrong. The problem, of course, is that sexual immorality devalues another person for your own pleasure, and when you start devaluing people for pleasure, it's -very- hard to stop, until eventually, you devalue everyone, and the only person you care about is yourself. Sexual immorality, in other words, can lead to the mentality that other people exist only to give you pleasure or satisfaction, which is as far removed from Christian charity as you can get.Next, the book gets into more of the virtues, as well as the vice of pride. I didn't think Lewis sufficiently pinned down just what exactly the sin of pride -is,- what makes it a sin and when, but I'm always looking for greater specificity in things like this.Book four of Mere Christianity gave me, I think, the most problems. Let me see if I can outline them.1. Lewis seems to think being nice is an inherently good thing. I can think of many situations where this wouldn't be the case, like a drill instructor, or a parish priest during his homilies. I'd have defined the difference between "nice" and "good" a bit more closely first.2. There's something of a division within Christianity on the subject of whether the resurrected saints are completely different people, or whether they're the same people; just resurrected with a better chance to live their lives well. I'm of the latter school of thought. Lewis, it seems, is not. Related to that...3. Lewis seems to imply that we need to sacrifice everything we've ever known, including our personhood, permanently, in order to make room for God. This is a misunderstanding. God is infinite. If we needed to "make room" for him, we could only do it by ceasing to exist. He seems to go back on this somewhat in the final chapter, but there's still the sense that the sacrifices of Christian life are permanent, not temporary, and that's not how I read Romans 8:11. I've always taken that verse to mean that all the things we have to give up in this life; "kill" here on Earth for the sake of doing right, will be restored to the saints in paradise, once the risk of sin is past.Still, as I said, none of these issues is too major, and none really tells too badly against this book. Additionally, there's an analogy near the end of the book which, in my view, is potentially better than even the book's author seems to realize. He describes the Christian faith is a sort of seed of evolution, like lumps on the back of a horse, which will eventually turn into wings, and give it the power to outstrip all the other horses in its ability to leap over barriers. However, until they become functional wings, you won't notice much difference in its ability to leap barriers.Now, the reason I say this is an even better analogy than he may have realized is that really, if a horse had incomplete, wing-like lumps on its back, it would, for the moment, be -less- capable of leaping over barriers, since it would be weighed down by those lumps. We often feel ourselves weighed down by the burden of having to do right; the difficulty of moral values in the face of an enemy who cheats repeatedly, and the realization that we can't achieve victory on these terms. We may even blame our faith for it. However, if we stick it out, if we wait a while, those burdensome lumps will become beautiful wings, and will become, not a hindrance, but an advantage. This, I think, shows some of the potential of this analogy. It's beautiful.If you want a basic grounding in Christianity, you could do a lot worse that to pick this book up and leaf through it. It's got a lot of good answers, which you might just need someday when your kids start asking you big questions about life and the faith.

review/text: &quot;Successful corporate transformation depends on effective decision making and leadership from three distinct but inter coonected entities: the CEO, the top management team, and the board of directors. The CEO is the executive who has overall responsibility for the conduct and performance of the firm; clearly his or her mindset, imagination, and behavior will have a defining effect on corporate adaptation. Ultimately, however, senior leadership is a shared endeavor, extending beyond the CEO to other top executives. Thus, the senior management group, widely referred to as the top management team, also has a central role in formulating and executing corporate transformation. The top management team is not simply an aggregation of individual executives. Rather, the dynamics and complementarities that exist within the team greatly influence corporate outcomes. Finally, the board of directors has legal responsibility for the governance of the firm...All three of these leadership entities are critically important to effective corporate adaptation under conditions of turbulence. This book examines all three, including their interconnections to one another and, particularly, their roles in designing and navigating effective corpotate change&quot; (from the Preface).In this context, in Chapter 6, Paul A. Allaire, chairman and CEO of Xerox Corporation, discusses in depth the role of the senior management team in bringing about a major transformation at his company. He argues that &quot;Effective teamwork harnesses creativity and unleashes brain power; it leads to better solutions, better decisions, and improved business results through more effective implementation.&quot; In this invaluable article, after describing the centrality of teamwork at Xerox, and teamwork at the CEO level-the top management team, he concludes with some lessons from experience on what works and what doesn't work as following:* Self-managed senior teams don't work.* Remotely located teams work less well than teams in physical proximity.* Laissez-faire or consensus leadership doesn't work.* Ill-defned team objectives, processes, and rewards hamper performance.* Teamwork starts with the CEO.* Total Quality Management tools and processes can enhance teamwork.* Roles, responsibilities, and expectations must be clarified.* An effective governance process must be in place.* Outside counsel and assistance helps.* Teams need to be explicitly launched and then maintained over time.Finally, Allaire writes that &quot;Those are my insights on teams at the senioe executive level. I should also point out that there is no free lunch. No matter how deep your commitment, teamwork does have some negative aspects. Teams are time-consuming. You utilize more of the time and energy of top management than if you dictate a solution or a direction. You also run the risk that a tendency toward groupthink may develop...Continuous improvement means a continuous team approach to solving problems and staying on the right course. Team members need to know how valuable their contribution is. That's why at Xerox we not only teach teamwork, we celebrate it.&quot;Strongly recommended.

review/text: Of all Pratchett's brilliantly drawn characters, Samuel Vimes stands unique in providing a realistic role model for the rest of us. He's honest, forthright, deeply suspicious of aristocracy, and best of all, despises the idea of kings. The last is important here, for someone wishes the return of the Ankh-Morpork monarchy. And Sam Vimes' remote ancestor, Old Stoneface, executed the last one.Edward d'Eath [how does PTerry come up with these names?!], an impoverished aristocrat, seeks fulfillment of his destiny by restoring the monarchy. Recruiting fellow lords to his cause proves difficult. It's been a long time since the last king, and the Patrician runs the city with commendable, if frightening, efficiency. So Edward embarks on a solitary campaign.Pratchett's inventive mind takes us from the &quot;fantasy&quot; genre into the murder mystery domain. Murder isn't a common event on the Discworld, and its occurrence here creates an intensity of feeling rarely evoked by Pratchett's works. Vimes is particularly irritated by such abhorrent events as murder. Assassination is bad enough, although carefully regulated by its Guild. For Vimes, murder is too arbitrary. It reflects the one aspect of society he resents the most, the exercise of absolute power. He's affronted both as a copper and a man.Partly inspired by Corporal Carrot, Vimes is no longer content having the Watch &quot;let things lie anymore&quot;. Forces that used to push a drunken Vimes into the gutter are forces he now resists, even struggles to overcome. It's an inspiring read watching Pratchett give Vimes a new sense of dedication. Vimes has always sought justice, and his recent rise in society and the Watch has given him fresh impetus, and clout, to gain it. However, first he must survive. He's up against a new force. A force of absolute power, without soul or pity - the Gonne.There are other aspects in this book beyond the new Old Stoneface trying to catch a murderer. Pratchett pays homage to the struggle for women's and immigrants' rights in Britain [and elsewhere]. The Watch has been compelled to recruit dwarves, trolls and, um, a woman. Sergeant Colon's attempts to reconcile size, attitudes and anatomy with a traditional human, male, role must bring tears to the eyes of all recruiting sergeants reading it. Pratchett's sympathetic view of Angua pays homage to the efforts of women striving to enter men's realms. But for a novel view of the world we all inhabit, there's few that can out-express Gaspode, one of Pratchett's finest creations.Pratchett possesses a superior ability to create timeless works. Nestled in this library since its publication, this book is taken up as an old friend for repeated enjoyment. There's nothing lost in re-reading Men At Arms - the issues remain timely, the characters worth noting - sometimes emulating, and the wit undiminished. If you're new to Pratchett, this is a fine place to start. If you're coming along in the Discworld sequence, be prepared for an item of exceptional value, something beyond the humorous fantasy of wizards, witches and Mort's employer.

review/text: &quot;The Cherry Orchard&quot; is an atrocious play. If we hold this play in high regard, then we dramatist's need to reevaluate our standards. Chekhov wrote a play that will make you not care an inch about the character's or their situation(s). For him to think that this is a comedy makes you wonder if he understood the point he himself was trying to make. The characters are pathetic and they'll make you pity them - not because of their predicaments, but because of whom they are. I do not recommend.

That performance led me to seek out this CD, and McDuffie's playing here is as lovely on the disc as it was in the live performance. His tone may not be as big as Itzhak Perlman's, but it is nevertheless exquisite (the phrase &quot;spun silver,&quot; though cliched, is apt). This is true concerto playing, the soloist carrying on a conversation with the orchestra (and, by extension, with the listener). I definitely will seek out more of McDuffie's discs, and I hope others will, too.

review/text: This film doesn't really seem to fit in one genre. Some call it a suspense film, others say it's horror. No doubt,this film is in a class of it's own, as is the film's director.In this movie, a young couple by the name of Rosemary and Guy move into an apartment in New York. Rosemary is a housewife, Guy is an aspiring actor. The apartment they move into was owned by a woman who died in mysterious circumstances, the next door neighbours are an elderly couple named Roman and Minnie.When the young woman living with them dies from an apparent suicide, Rosemary reaches out to them, and they accpet her friendship with a lot more than just open arms.Rosemary falls pregnant, but instead of being a joyous occasion, bizarre and deadly events begin to happen all around Rosemary. And it all seems to revolve around her unborn child, she soon becomes convinced that the couple next door belong to a coven and that they want her baby for their own evil purposes. But with no friends, and nobody to believe her Rosemary begins to fight against the conspiracy, believing that her own husband is involved too.This has all of the trademark Polanski things: an apartment, a main character whose sanity and grip on reality you come to question, claustrophobic settings.This was the film that made Mia Farrow a bona fide star, eclipsing that of her then husband Frank Sinatra. It also made Roman Polanski a household name in America.This film is more a suspense than a horror film, but nevertheless it is superb in every way.

review/text: What is most amazing about Harrington's book is how accurately it describes today's society. The impact of this book, first published in the early 60s, is testament to the power that a single book can have on a nation and its people. It directly affected the thoughts and actions of President Johnson's "war on poverty". Unfortunately, this "war on poverty" may never come to a conclusion, even in the richest country in the world.The book itself contains a good introduction by Howe, who puts the impact of Harrington's work in context. Filled with statistics, which are unfortunately not well referenced, the case is made that the scale of poverty in the US is a travesty and an outrage. Harrington himself lived amongst the poor and disenfranchised members of New York's society for a brief period of time and he writes about their general hopelessness and lack of purpose in life. The descriptions and analysis of this book allow you to view the world through the 'lens' of poverty, to know (on a superficial level) the crippling and depressing lives of our society's poorest members. Harrington was perhaps the leading American socialist of his time, so be warned that his views and crituqes have a liberal/leftist stance and that much of the book disparages the efforts of the US government (perhaps, rightly so).As an added bonus, this edition of the book includes some insightful afterwords by Harrington about poverty in the 70s and 80s. Overall, an important and powerful work that is a must-read for anyone concerned with the issue of poverty in the US (which should be everyone, shouldn't it?).

review/text: While A Rip In Heaven succeeds on a number of levels, it does so in spite of itself. Jeanine (Tink) Cummins literary device of writing in the third-person omniscient is grating to say the least. A compelling story of murder, rape, and police malfeasance is sidetracked by a gimmicky POV. Miss Cummins wants to be Truman Capote. Still, its a good story. The police again prove themselves to be clowns and the guilty parties are brought to justice by sheer luck. Gee! What a surprise... cops acting self-righteous and stupid. I swear, law enforcement must recruit at the Special Olympics. The account of their boorish and pompous behavior that almost sent an innocent person to jail should be a warning. THEY ARE NOT ALL HEROES!!!!!! In fact, very few are. Some cops are decent I'm sure (I'm still looking) although this account should dispel any notion that the police are always on the side of the angels. Jeanine Cummins' book is worth the price of admission if it causes the reader to look at police with a more jaundiced eye.Nevertheless, the fact that Cummins writes a first person account from an overly self aware third-person viewpoint is just plain distracting. Miss Tink, the story itself is interesting. Knowing that you cried a...well...a Mississippi River worth of tears and threw up a bazillion times adds nothing to the story.One other thing. If I were Tom Cummins, your brother, I'd want to hide under a rock after reading your account. Tom is portrayed as the biggest wuss on God's green earth. Tom can't fight, Tom cries when the police swear at him, Tom can't handle a night in a holding cell, Tom was humiliated, Tom felt like throwing up, etc. Thanks a heap, little sis, you've succeeded in totally emasculating your brother for all the world to see. In Tink's attempt at painting a sympathetic picture of her brother she has turned him into the biggest pansy imaginable.Okay, so what does reccomend this work? Thanks for asking. Jeanine Cummins is a capable writer. The story sucks the reader in and her sense of pacing is very good for a first time author. The book holds your attention and flows easily with only a few exceptions. So, criticisms aside, buy A Rip In Heaven. I look forward to reading her next book.

review/text: A message to each and every reviewer who takes time to add thoughts to a any media of memorial of 9/11, World Trade Center Towers tragedy... thank you from my heart.My spouse and I resided on the Lower West Side, Battery Park City, Gateway Plaza, So. End Ave. As survivors of the 9/11 World Trade Center Towers tragedy... From our Gateway Plaza apartment, facing the street and 300 yards from the Towers, we helplessly witnessed all from our apartment windows. The closeness of the Towers viewed from our windows - gave an illusion that one could reach out and touch the Towers; their beauty with night lights reaching toward the sky promoted a contemplative emotion.We viewed the planes entering the Towers, the overwhelming inferno, individuals jumping, the collapse of the Towers, the darkness as debris hit our windows with a fury. What occurred over a period of hours, seemed like a much shorter time span. The darkness was darker than an eclipse, darker than the darkest night; and then a momentary hush after the air cleared. Viewing the roof garden one floor below, with the human reaction of looking out to see if someone might be on that roof garden and in need of help. Debris strewn everywhere, recording tape and paper hung from the trees of the garden and oh, so much ash. The momentary hush, whether real or imagined, then the viewing of debris for a second, fantasized that a parade had just passed by on our short street. I now really understand the expression a &quot;feeling of helplessness&quot;, I couldn't fix what had just happened.We vacated our apartment finally at 5:15 p.m. that day, waiting for someone to knock on our door, with only a battery radio to keep us abreast of happenings. &quot;In a New York minute&quot;, we evacuated via the stairwell touched with ash, the result of a first floor door left open. With a few belongings, gathered with a tad of thought of what was being left behind, we stepped out of the door onto the pavement, seeing and standing in ever so much ash &amp; debris, I wanted to turn around and go back to our home. It was one moment of reality in time, I carry to this day.We planned to walk up the East Side, glimpsed the tired fire, police, volunteers, and med techs in our immediate driveway and street, so instead opted to pass through the building in back of the apartment complex. We gained access to the Esplanade walking the short distance to reach the Hudson River North Cove dock. We were escorted to the New Jersey shore via New York Police boat. From the boat deck, we viewed even more damage to the Manhattan skyline, especially noting the zigzag shape of the side of the American Express building, housed in one of the World Financial Center buildings along with the glorious Winter Garden, as well as the fall of World Trade Center Building 7. We were taken to the Jersey City Hospital, attended to by compassionate staff. Then traveled by National Guard truck to Hoboken, NJ where we were housed by a wonderful family who with great trust welcomed strangers to their home.On Friday 9/14, our eldest son &amp; daughter-in-law drove from New Hampshire via New Jersey routes to Hoboken for transport us to New Hampshire for temporary residence with our daughter, who along with her friend and our youngest son, greeted us with open arms &amp; the overwhelming feeling of not wanting to let go with each hug that followed. Our daughter and son had spent that Friday in New Hampshire collecting items of clothing and necessities which the Concord community generously opened their hearts and donated by churches, stores, individuals, employers, American Red Cross, et al.One of our grandchildren -- he was 8 at that time - arrived home from a few days with his Dad. He hugged us so tight, understanding the depth of 9/11 events for someone so young and yet so wise. He told Grandpa &amp; Babcia that he had something for them... his Mom was not even aware of his gift. He had spoken to his classmates about his grandparents' closeness in location of the World Trade Center Towers. Presented to us was a large envelope full of hand-made cards from each of his classmates. And if that isn't love and caring, I don't know what is - from the hearts and minds of children!Residing now in New Hampshire, not because of 9/11 drove us away, but circumstances just went that way as we continue to put our lives into perspective.We Miss - New York City deeply; events found nowhere else in the USA, the introduction to &amp; interaction with so many wonderful cultures. There isn't a day or night over these years that we do not think of 9/11... the Lady of Liberty &amp; Ellis Island both on the merge of the East and Hudson Rivers. And that Lady of Liberty wept, I just know it, &amp; still stands with pride that the USA is a democracy that will prevail.We Remember - the victims, the survivors, their friends and families, the workers from the public and private sector, the volunteers, our neighbors in Gateway Plaza and staff in the small group of stores on South End Avenue, Battery Park City.We Remember - the places we visited, the book signings attended, the celebrities we met, the concerts and theater plays, the movies, the arts, the parks, the strangers we talked with, on streets, on subway and those while standing in line for an event...We Remember - Always In Our Hearts, Forever In Our Souls, Heroes, Victims, Survivors One and All... We Were There.Painfully, the lump in my throat and the twist in my stomach, the tears in my eyes and the pain in my heart, to the depth of my soul, forever reside.

review/text: "The Mayor of Casterbridge" ought to be the model of what a classic is not. Books deemed as a "classic" are said to be everlasting and universal in its message. This book does not spread its wings into our era, and it does not apply to everyone in some way, unless you've experienced paternity uncertainty and emotional neglect. The characters are rigid, changing without reason, and lacking practical emotions. Michael Henchard is repulsive from the start, from when he sells his wife and child, to his emotional withdrawal towards the young woman who turned out to be his non-biological daughter, to hiding the truth of who her father actually was to Elizabeth-Jane, so one cannot pity his outcome. Elizabeth-Jane, the non-biological daughter of Henchard, was completely void of personality. "Blas&eacute;" has more personality than Elizabeth-Jane. After a tennis match type life, of being flung back and forth between fathers, to marrying Donald Farfrae who one day courted her, married another woman (who just happened to be the landlord of the house Elizabeth-Jane was living at, at the time), and then realized his affection for her, Elizabeth-Jane would've been a prime candidate for therapy (how could she give her heart to men who kept being introduced as her father?), but instead acted as if she was a spokesperson normalcy. Finally, Donald Farfrae, a Scotsman, who was the poster boy for blandness, never really showed growth. He was always monotone, and I could not tell if he found Elizabeth-Jane's biological father to scorn Henchard, or truly help Elizabeth-Jane find the truth. I felt naught for the characters but purposelessness, and the story itself was uncreative and improbable. I do no recommend.

review/text: Life was hard and times were no joke in the economically blighted cities and wind-blasted rural areas that marked a Depression era America. Whatever joy most Americans grasped for seemed to be just beyond their collective reaches. In OF MICE AND MEN John Steinbeck portrays a people who are just as blighted as the land on which they trod. Lennie Small and George Milton are two migrants who are forced to wander the midwest in search of the American Dream, which, to them, meant a place of their own. Each recognizes that this dream will, in all likelihood, remain just that, an evanescent will-o-the-wisp that leaves them with little else but to talk about it. Many times in the novel, the huge but retarded Lennie asks George, a smallish but bright thinker, to rhapsodize about their future. To George, their American Dream is a place where no one can throw them out. To Lennie, it is a place where he can raise rabbits. And it is not only Lennie and George who reach out for the unobtainable. It is arguable that nearly everyone else has their own competing dreams, with the same chance of success as Lennie and George have--none at all. The ranch hands where Lennie and George find roustabout jobs are the hopeless in search of the unobtainable. Candy is a one-armed elderly worker who seeks security for his old age. Crooks is a proud black worker who searches for racial equality in an age that did not know the term. Curley is a nastily pugnacious man who spends most of the scenes in which he appears in a hopeless and helpless Holy Grail search for his wife who spends an equal amount of time staying out of his way. And then there is Curley's wife, who is so bereft of identity that Steinbeck chooses not even to give her a name. She wanders the book like a meandering Eve, seeking only to disrupt the ordered lives of the men around her. In her search for meaning to her life, she collides with a corresponding search by Lennie for meaning in his. When she places Lennie's unthinking paws on her hair and dress, Lennie panics and unthinkingly stifles her, setting off a chain of events that forces George to play with Lennie's dream of a rabbit warren as a tearfully tragic prelude to ending that dream. In OF MICE AND MEN, Steinbeck catches not only the gritty edginess of political and emotional instability that then was ripping apart the social fabric of a pre-World War II America, he was also telling a timeless tale that suggests that for dreams to transform to reality, those dreamers had better leave the world of dreams long enough to weigh the balance of cost versus benefit. For Lennie, for Curley's wife, the price was way too high.

review/text: The good author believes the gentle reader is fascinated by detailed descriptions of underwater flora, fauna, and geology when, in reality, gentle reader is wondering when something is going to happen. Many is the retired gent who has come to me with his list of a kabillion classics he is supposed to read before he dies and I suggest he also check out maybe a cowboy and a mystery, but he does not and he never checks out anything again. Well, a "classic" is merely a book that is still in print, possibly because the publisher does not have to pay royalties on public domain titles. Now, this book is still in print; so, by golly, it indeed qualifies as a classic. And, it is just the thing to give to a reluctant reader to prevent him from ever checking out anything again. It is definitely not a fast read by modern standards. Not that TLUTS is not a great read, but it is hard work for an average reader and should not be required of the inexperienced reader. Thus the book deserves, perhaps, a 5 star for the experienced classic reader but only a 1 star for the novice.

review/text: I don't get to say this very often, but the Prince Caspian movie was better than the novel.When I read through the Narnia series a few months ago, I had the thought that for the books to be made into good films, the Disney writers were going to have to add some scenes, to fill in the blanks where C.S. Lewis' high creativity fell short.This film does a great job filling in the blanks. 4 or 5 key scenes were added to the film rather seemlessly, and moviegoers who haven't read the books in a long while won't even realize which scenes are new to the story. I had a hard enough time distinguishing, and I just read the novels.All that said, the movie is a good time...humorous, action-packed, tense, and creative. More than anything, the film paints an accurate picture of Lucy's faith journey with Aslan and how her siblings learn with her.Fun times.--- Reviewed by Jonathan Stephens

review/text: Serious film lovers are surely blessed that Facets Video (which brought out top rated 'Decalogue' and recently Bela Tarr's 'Satantango') has now released a totally pristine DVD of this almost forgotten 1970's U.K. filmmaker.Here is Douglas' own poverty stricken childhood in a small Scottish village, recreated using mainly non-professional actors in three one hour segments. According to the added special feature documentary, Douglas (who died in 1991 of lung cancer) escaped the brutality of his surroundings by virtually living in his town's dumpy movie theater. If this brings to mind Antoine Doinel in Truffaut's 'The 400 Blows,' that's fine, but replace Antoine's Paris with a landscape straight from Samuel Beckett.Douglas' genius was very much appreciated at the time but the producers also knew he had little commercial appeal. He was only to make one commercial film ("Comrades") before his death.He was very much enamoured of silent movies and in this trilogy, dialog is very limited. Instead, his camera lingers long enough on a face or an abandoned yard or a shabby table, so that words become superfluous.This is a great film experience. Several days after seeing it for the first time, the images still replay themselves in my mind. Once you own it, you'll know exactly what to buy next for your dedicated film buff friends.

review/text: In retrospect this huge choral piece seems much more typical of the music Messiaen was writing in the mid-60s than it did at the time of its premiere. The sound world it conjures up is very like that of, say, Et Expecto, Couleurs de la Cite Celeste or Des Cantons aux Etoiles. The major difference is the use of voices. This was Messiaen's first choral piece since the 5 Rechants and the choral style is very different from either that challengingly experimental piece or from the earlier 3 Petites Liturgies - more of a forerunner to St. Francois, in fact. In La Transfiguration the choral writing is largely written in unison for the narrative plainchant-derived sections or in chordal blocks for the many chorale-like passages.If that sounds monotonous, it is more than made up for in the brilliance of the orchestral writing. Here is a profusion of the composer's beloved birds, taken from all over the world. Here is the glitter of a large batterie of tuned percussion. Here is the special sound only Messiaen had the key to in his brass and woodwind writing. And here is all Messiaen's unique synesthetic (seeing harmonies as colours) approach to slowly shifting chords and keys. Here, too, are love-songs to match the central movement of Turangalila, landscapes to match the vivid pictures in Des Canyons or the Catalogue d'Oiseaux and huge marmoreal chorales to match the equivalent movements in Et Expecto or even Messiaen's last orchestral work, Eclairs sur l'au dela.What is distinctive about La Transfiguration, as befits its subject, is the way in which Messiaen seems to be exploring ways of writing music as an objective correlative for light. The nearest comparison I can think of is the late paintings of Monet where he attempted to capture the very nature of light itself in his paint. Whether it's the iridescent shimmer of light on the wings of an exotic bird, the sudden stark flash of lightning on a dark landscape or the blinding brilliance of the light of the Transfiguration itself, Messiaen unerringly finds the appropriate musical metaphor.This is an important recording because the work's sheer size precludes too many performances. Certainly the modern sound is a huge asset, allowing all that colourful orchestral palette to shine at its brightest. But there is something of the Messiaenic ecstasy and abandon missing from this performance. It is all a bit too careful. For example, the piece was partly a response to Rostropovich's repeated requests for a Cello Concerto from the composer and there is a crucial part for solo cello. The cellist on this French performance simply lacks Slava's richness, depth of tone and passion - he's too monochrome. So, too, the singing of the choir, which is musically precise but lacks the variety and colour that show a real response to the text however static the musical line seems to be. The currently unavailable Dorati performance from Washington on Decca, made soon after the work's premiere, comes much closer to an ideal performance. Seek that out if you can. If not, this disc will serve as a more than adequate introduction to a major and little known Messiaen work.

However, no one in their right mind would pay the retail price if they felt them first hand.These are soft enough but nothing about them is at all luxurious. The top sheet runs narrow and quite long and the pillow cases are on the small side. The sheets do fit my queen size futon and average size pillows but I'd recommend getting the King size and just shrinking them some in the wash.The print is nice, I was pleasently suprised, the earthtone colors keep it from being way too girly.

review/text: Asimov's entire line of work, and namely the 'Foundation' novels, have long been considered by some to be the gold-standard of science fiction. As an avid reader of the genre, I felt implied to give the series a whirl, to see what all the fuss is about and to finally spend some time with one of the grand-daddies of the golden age. So I bought 'Foundation', along with the other two novels in the original trilogy, and away I went.Very boring. Very dry. Very forgettable. The problem here, I think, is that while Asimov had some very fantastic ideas floating around in that pioneering noggin of his, he was not exactly the best at nurturing them into full-form on the page. Thus, we have a series of novels that read much more like outlines of a stronger and more fleshed-out epic. The setting is grand, the characters are intriguing. The plot is one for the ages. The final product, however, does little justice to these ideas and I found that to be vastly disappointing. All throughout, I wanted more. I wanted more world-building - not necessarily technobabble and meandering Dickenson discription, but at least more insight into the nature of this vast civilization apparently on the brink of collapse. Very much the same with the characters - I wanted to sympathize with Hari Seldon as he worked to keep knowledge alive in the face of ignorance, but it was so hard to do so when he was presented as little more than a piece of animated cardboard. I was thinking constantly about what could have been, and that put a damper on the overall effect.I think the ideas and character tropes Asimov put forth in his trilogy have been worked with by other authors and brought to life far more successfully in the years since its initial release. Novels that come to mind are Dan Simmons's awe-inspiring 'Hyperion' series and Neal Stephenson's bulky 'Anathem'. In these books, great ideas are coupled with great writing. The results, as much as it hurts me to say it, put Asimov's original to shame.'Foundation' is a great series to read if you want to witness science fiction as it was in its infantile and supposedly-golden age. But I think that it#s nevertheless important to understand that pioneering ideas can further develop and be presented in far-superior ways as the years progress. Such is the case here. Imaginative, but slow and dated. Should most certainly remain in print and continue to be read, but I do not think it is the gold-standard classic it has been made out to be. Others have done much better.

review/text: Schreker's "Das Spielwerk und der Prinzessin" is a remarkable little opera. Typical of Schreker's operas, it's a wildly imagined fairy tale with lots of weird pseudo-Freudian subtext.Schreker wrote in an ulta-rich, ambitious, romantic-expressionist idiom--complex both harmonically and orchestrally. Schreker pursued unusual orchestral timbres with great imagination. His music is garish and irridescent.Schreker seems to glory in his ability to conjure up strangely imagined worlds of magic, romance, sexual depravity, and in the case of "Spielwerk", purification. His characters are often strange blends of earnestness and corruption--in some cases these blends border on being so far from real human experience that they're unsympathetic or dramatically unconvincing. But in "Spielwerk", I think he does a better job than in some other operas, and the language of his librettos (which he always wrote himself) is always beautiful.The story of "Spielwerk" is downright weird, and can't be explained simply!In the backstory of "Spielwerk", the old craftsman Master Florian had spent a his lifetime crafting a musicbox that produces music of unearthly beauty, but only came alive when his son played his violin. The Princess who ruled from a nearby castle began holding wild orgiastic parties where she would strip off her robes and "yield" to her male guests. Master Florian's wife, his assistant "Wolf", and his son were all eventually seduced by the parties, where his son, now the Princess's lover, would play the musicbox, driving the revellers to even wilder excesses. So Master Florian renounced his wife, and drove his son from his house out into the world. The music box fell silent.In the beginning of the opera, Master Florian's son has died, and is brought to his cabin's door, where his now penitent wife urges him to take the boy's body inside. He refuses. A mysterious travelling flute player happens by, and is invited by Florian to stay with him. When the guest plays his noble music, the musicbox suddenly, to Master Florian's surprise, comes to life!The Princess, now despondent at having lost her lover and the music of the "Spielwerk", plans one final party, and asks "Wolf" to burn her and her guests to death upon it's completion. The flute player meets the Princess by chance on the road, and they feel drawn to one another. He thinks she's just a common woman, and when she urges him to run away with her to start a new life, he's tempted. But he tells her that he has come to heal and redeem the Princess, and that until he does so, he cannot leave. She tells him of the Princess's terrible corruption, and that she cannot be healed. But he is immovable.The party begins, but is interrupted by a mob led by Master Florian's former wife. They threaten to tear the Princess to pieces. But at the last moment, the flute player intervenes, playing his flute. At that moment the musicbox responds. Florian's son's corpse sits up and begins to play his violin along with the Spielwerk's wonderous tones, and all the listeners are entranced. The flute player and the Princess dance together, singing ecstatically, and wend their way slowly towards the distant castle. "Wolf" and his cohorts burn Master Florian's cabin to the ground, finally silencing the musicbox.During the second decade of the 20th century, Schreker became the second most successful living opera composer in the German speaking world, second only Strauss. "Spielwerk" was his one dud in a string of successes--following "Der ferne Klang", and preceeding "Die Gezeichneten" and "Der Schatzgraber", each which was more successful than the last. He revised "Spielwerk", cutting it's already brief length (100 minutes). But the revision was also a flop. This recording, from the enterprising Kiel Opera, is a reconstruction of the original version.I can't help but recommend this strange little operatic hallucination!

review/text: The Other Boleyn Girl is a good read. The author is a very able storyteller, allowing us a glance into the interiors of Tudor England and Henry VIII's court. Her characters are mostly to be pitied as we see the push and pull of great families vying for political and social dominance in the realm. In this society, daughters are bought and sold like prized cattle, their families acknowledging that they were no more than pawns in the courtly game.No one knows much about the life of Mary Boleyn, however the major events and general outline of her life are understood and followed somewhat accurately in this novel. Because of this obscurity, Philippa Gregory uses it to her advantage and invents the feelings and emotions of those around her, at the same time giving us a fresh look into the events surrounding her family and of course her sister. Gregory may take too many liberties with the attitude of the characters; she shapes Anne Boleyn into a hateful devil-woman and perhaps allows Mary to be a bit too innocent. Other than those issues the only problem I had with the book were technical.Her use of adverbs is incessant, everyone always replies harshly, coyly, triumphantly, and miserably, coldly, etc. You get the idea. The other problem I noticed was some time period inconsistencies. Obviously it is a historical novel, but there are many times when she will laps into modern phrases and ideas, I know she must do this to get her point across, but it sticks out like a sore thumb. For instance: "Mary went downstairs to get a pen and paper to write a note to the king". I don't believe in sixteenth century anywhere the use of pens or paper was existent. Maybe she could have said a quill and parchment or something. Anyway that is just one example and for all of these discrepancies.She makes up for it with her ability to tell a story and her written dialog I found myself wrapped up in the exchanges, they were wonderful and quick. The voice of her characters really comes out here.I would recommend this book to anyone who is a fan of historical fiction, or anyone who is interested in this time period. It is a fresh perspective into the life of an obscure woman and a lesson on the treatment and role of women in this society.

review/text: I enjoyed Ladislas Farago's similarly titled book. The book details Patton's activities during the last months of the war and continues to his untimely demise. It also briefly explored the conspiracy theory's surrounding Patton's accident. Unfortunately the movie concentrates on George S. Patton Jr.'s time as military governor, thinly veiled attempts to militarily rehabilitate German POWs incarcerated in Bavaria, and blatant animosity toward the Soviets. Additionally, the film spends an awful lot of time on a paralyzed Patton, complete with flashbacks, imobilized in his hospital bed.It was great to see George C. Scott reprise his role as Patton. The problem was that it was easier for a late 1960s Scott to be made up to appear as an older general in PATTON than it was to tackle the problem of an older and more stout Scott as Patton in the 1986 television movie. Scott was just too plump for the role and those overly puffy white eyebrows were more appropriate for Santa Claus than Patton.Remember too that this was a television movie filmed in Great Britain. As such, the budget and associated production was not that of the original motion picture. The US military vehicles are obviously from museums and private collector collections as the gray-green paint is absolutely perfect. Likewise the GIs appear to be wearing less authentic looking period uniforms. Additionally, where the original PATTON was filmed in a variety of Spanish locations including beaches, desert, and thick forest, LAST DAYS is mired in limited British locations. In one scene the painted matte background of the Bavarian Alps is phony and distracting.Although I cannot imagine anyone other than George C. Scott playing the part of Patton, he was not physically ready to take on the role. Remember that the previous year Scott also portrayed a very chubby Benito Mussolini in MUSSOLINI: THE UNTOLD STORY. Other former 'Pattons', such as George Kennedy, Kirk Douglas, and Darren McGavin never fit the role. This movie probably should never have been made in the first place, or limited as a narrarated docu-drama.THE LAST DAYS OF PATTON is as far removed from the original wide-screen movie as THE DIRTY DOZEN: (THE) NEXT MISSION is from the first THE DIRTY DOZEN film.Worse for the film is that its sale and distribution, much like older movies that entered the public domain, have fallen to several different media companies. As such you can find this movie with different covers, sometimes matched with other movies, and differing quality. My advice is for you to buy a copy of the book and avoid the disappointing movie.

review/text: The epic poem that is Beowulf ranks as one of the greatest pieces of literature man has ever produced. When a reader ponders the ideas found within this wonderful work of art the mind simply boggles at the depth and richness running throughout the poem. Glimpses of the old Europe abound in this tale about Hrothgar, Beowulf, Grendel, and Grendel's mother, a Europe of drinking halls, campaigns of conquest, human destiny, and dark monsters creeping through the night. Simultaneously, a reader of Beowulf glimpses the stirrings of Christianity, which would soon overrun all of Europe and put an end to the old ways. Scholars of Beowulf never tire of writing articles and books about this piece of literature and new translations of the work continually appear. If you wish to read Beowulf, and I recommend you do so as quickly as possible, check out the spectacular Seamus Heaney translation. Do not, under any circumstances, watch this cinematic version of Beowulf in lieu of reading the poem. Not only does this movie not follow the epic in any significant way, the film also takes a decidedly B movie approach to the whole topic. &quot;Beowulf&quot; stars Z movie star Christopher Lambert as the enigmatic hero, another point you would do well to consider before popping this disc in your DVD player.At some point in the future, in a time never elaborated upon by the filmmakers, a fortress stands watch on the borderland between good and evil. The soldiers in the fort, led by a king named Hrothgar and his right hand man Roland, fight endlessly with a mysterious creature who shambles out of the dark each night to claim a new victim. The garrison rapidly diminishes under the onslaught of this malevolent apparition until one day a man rides up to the fort claiming that his destiny involves fighting evil. This man is Beowulf, played with mind deadening woodenness by a bleach blonde Christopher Lambert. The men manning the fort are naturally suspicious of this new arrival, but after Beowulf fights the creature to a standstill the men are more accepting of his presence. In no time at all, Beowulf antagonizes Roland, wins the admiration of Hrothgar, and catches the eye of the king's busty daughter Kyra. The killings continue unabated until the big showdown between Beowulf and Grendel, the name of the being haunting the soldiers in the castle. A further surprise appears in scenes involving Hrothgar's dream encounters with a mysterious blonde apparition, a woman who has something to do with the death of the king's wife and who eventually plays a big role at the end of the film.Initially, I warmed to &quot;Beowulf.&quot; Despite Lambert in the lead role, most of the actors did a better than expected job in their roles. The gorgeous Rhona Mitra did an adequate turn playing Hrothgar's daughter. Charles Robinson, who played Mac on &quot;Night Court,&quot; does as much as he can in the role of the fort's chief weapons master, and the actors playing Hrothgar and Roland did acceptable work as well. The set pieces looked better than average for a B movie, as did the armor and weapons used by the characters. The movie starts with a nice fight scene between Beowulf and a small army outside of the fort, and this too gave me hope that the movie would rise above my original expectations. As the movie wore on, I discovered my interest waned considerably. The CGI effects used for Grendel and his mother looked cheesy and uninteresting, and Lambert's portrayal of Beowulf tended to grate after the first thirty minutes. The soundtrack contributed greatly to my sense of irritation. The filmmakers saw fit to imbue this project with a booming techno beat, and used it every chance they got whether the scene called for it or not. Sometimes this music does work, but far too often it distracts and annoys. To keep boredom at bay, I began to count how many times Beowulf executed fancy back flips during the combat sequences. In fact, it seemed that the only thing Lambert's character did after awhile was jump around, strike poses, and mutter cryptic phrases about the evil in the fort. As the final credits rolled, I knew I had just finished watching a typical B movie stinker.The &quot;Beowulf&quot; DVD is far from a bare bones sort of release. There is a trailer for the film, along with additional trailers for films like &quot;Scream 3.&quot; A short behind the scenes featurette is also available. The movie itself looks good for a low budget bomb, and you should still have a good time watching the nice looking women in this movie even if you cannot stomach the lousy dialogue or abominable special effects. &quot;Beowulf&quot; is a must see for those who get a kick out of science fiction cheese films or fans of Christopher Lambert, but all others should stay away.

I used &quot;The Philosophic Classics 2nd edition, From Plato to Nietzsche&quot; for my classes and was looking for a text with the same basic works with some more contemporary materials. I find the updated 3rd edition, &quot;From Plato to Derrida&quot; the perfect solution. Instead of having to look through more textbooks for the right stuff, this is it.

For example, read this book instead of the CruiseControl documentation, if you need CruiseControl on your project.It's also very well-written and organized, with just the right amount of examples - no tedious 10-page listings.Much better than the O'Reilly lizard book. What's up with the lizard anyway? They had a ready-made animal cover in Ant, and they ignored it.

At first the music seem dissonant, it had the make-up of music I knew from my childhood but yet it sounded like nothing I had ever heard before. It took me a while to train my ear to the melody but once I did.......oh, what sounds.I like to sit in the dark, to hear it on rainy days, to appreciate it when I'm not rushed. Then it brings a recollection of past memories, of lived lives. It is as if Lhasa was singing to my inner-self and releasing someting......the world!She sings with the soul of someone who has been searching the world over for love, truth, beauty, peace....&quot;Por que el alma prende fuego cuando deja de amar&quot; (because the soul sets itself on fire when it ceases to love).I hope you enjoy Lhasa's music, mysterious music as much as I have.

review/text: While I loved both movies, Jean de Florette and the sequel Manon of the Spring, I would rate the first of the pair to to have an edge over the second. They are both masterfully done, and you really can't watch just one of them, as they are an inseparable pair, the first movie forming the background for the second, and the second providing the resolution for the first. Without giving up too much of the story, these movies tell a story of greed, "accidental" murder, and resolution with the likes of Greek tragedy--critically and tenderly revealing the mysterious nature of the human heart. Two of the best set of movies ever in my lifetime. My only criticism of the 2nd movie is the weak portrayal of the young woman, which came down to either poor direction or perhaps a poor casting decision. Overall, this flaw can be overlooked, as these two movies will stand as classics for many years to come.

review/text: Piper Perabo is an aspiring songwriter who moves to New York City to follow her dreams. Having trouble getting her foot in the door, she ends up working at a wild bar where the female patrons dance around on the bar in wet T-shirts to cheesy cheerleader anthems. John Goodman turns in an enjoyable performance as Perabo's overprotective father. Those expecting an edgier and more adult-oriented version of "Coyote Ugly" with its new "unrated cut" may want to save their money. With the exception of an added sex scene involving Piper Perabo and Adam Garcia (Perabo's nude shots were filmed with a "double"), the movie is still "PG-13" country. It's the same sexually-suggestive but far from edgy content you'll find in the theatrical cut.

review/text: What a ridiculous book! I sensed no plot, the characters were weak at best, the story didn't flow evenly, and I got the feeling the author wrote it for something to do in his spare time. Most stories evoke feelings in the reader, this one evoked only boredom. The author never even explained who or what &quot;The Legacy&quot; was. From reading other reviews, I gathered there is a TV show, but the author should have opened his mind to those of us who are new to his series. Nothing concrete was explained, the evil Mr. Hunter even seemed vague. And after attempting to build Mr. Hunter into an ominous subject, he is melted with a dash of holy water. Puhlease.... Not once was it mentioned how Mr. Hunter planned to carry on what was his life's work and meaning after he slaughtered his comrades either. Don't waste your time on this ugly manifestation of literature, it speaks only to the weakest of minds. Evan's mother was a joke, what was that &quot;fog&quot; she supposedly carried around? And WHO, if not Evan, was speaking to her? If we got the TV show here in Saudi Arabia, I wouldn't even bother to watch it after reading this book.

review/text: I admit I found this kit initially attractive for its promise to teach conversational Russian minus the difficult grammar and other &quot;messy bits&quot;, and was lured by the 45 minutes a day, six week claim. Such a program has its benefits, but after all was said and done, I was left wishing that I had taken the time to begin with the basics.Apart from an unexplained alphabet chart in the introductory chapter and a very few flash cards, &quot;Instant Russian&quot; doesn't bother with Cyrillic letters, using instead a phonetically spelled equivalent of each word. The strategy is to allow a better mastery of tricky Russian pronunciations; I was left feeling ultimately hindered by the method. After completing the course, I was able to recite words and phrases but had absolutely no idea how to recognize the majority of my new vocabulary as it might appear on a store front sign or restaurant menu. I feel that I would have fared much better with at least a basic understanding of the Russian characters.Also, I was unsure of the exact sounds of some of the letter groupings, as the female voice on the cassette has a British accent. Several of the english word examples given, especially those in the section pertaining to vowel sounds, contained words that are pronounced differently in Britain than in North America. This isn't a HUGE problem, but for those outside the UK, it's something to consider.That said, I give &quot;Instant Russian&quot; three stars because it delivers what it claims - important words and phrases without the bother of difficult grammar. It is neither for those with a serious interest in studying the language nor for those that would prefer to learn Russian using the Cyrillic characters, something I highly recommend doing.I understand how this program might be greatly appreciated by travellers wishing only to grasp the basics of conversational Russian, but wanting more, I have decided to invest the time and effort into exploring a more traditional approach to the language.

review/text: I always love reading the adult reviews of cartoons, especially if they never saw the cartoon as a child. Every child's movie has plot holes. Get over it. I saw this movie when I was very young and watched it a lot. I didn't like every character in the movie, including the prince. I watched it because of the unicorn. That is the point right? I mean it is about unicorns.I also love the people crying out over the two instances of 'damn' and the supposed adult situations. Do you let your children outside? Swear words are everyhere. You can't walk down the street anymore without hearing a string of them. Don't isolate your children, teach them that swear words make you look uneducated. Disney has adult situations in almost all of it's movies. In fact it is getting worse, such as the one liners that I hope go over childrens' heads. You all really need to watch the modren cartoons. There are adult themes, sex, and other subtle things around every corner. I also like the people proclaiming Disney over this movie. Disney makes people perfect, makes them all look the same and acceptable and in the end creates unbelievable happy endings. I would take a talking butterfly over the endless musical hack numbers that are jammed into any Disney film. Don't subject your children to such things. They really are more intelligent then that.The bottom line is that this movie at least has a theme that isn't sugar coated. It is approriate for children but I would watch it with children under the age of ten just because of a couple of scenes that might scare them, such as the harpie. Children's movies are silly and have plot holes and have reality issues but they are written for children - not for adults. There is a lot of good material in this movie - at the least it teaches courage. The last unicorn in the end faces her fears and wins. The plot is original and hasn't been done to death. I've never seen another movie like it and hope that no one tries to remake it. It's definitely worth at least a rental from the movie store.I have it on VHS and seeing all the comments about the DVD I would rent it from the video store or try to find it second hand. The VHS video quality is actually quite good and is not grainy at all.

review/text: David Remnick's "Lenin's Tomb" is a book about the journalist's experiences just before and during the collapse of the USSR at the end of the 1980s. Using a chronological overview, Remnick describes what the Soviet Union was like under the reign of Gorbachov (or "Gorbachev" in US spelling) and his views on the various leaders, journalists, KGB officers, bureaucrats, dissidents and so on.Because Remnick goes almost entirely by interviews for his information, the book gives a very thorough biographical view of the times, but there is very little information on the general state of the country, economic and social causes for the collapse, and so on. Remnick's tone and style are very much like those of a tabloid investigative journalist, describing people and events mostly by way of the author's opinions and what the people he interviews look and act like. This has the benefit of giving one the impression of re-living the interactions with the famous of those years, but is far too shallow for any explanatory purpose.Additionally, Remnick has too obvious favorites among the people involved. Gorbachov is generally shown more negatively than often in the West, but that fits the overall negative appraisal given to him in Russia. But people like Yeltsin and Solzhenitsyn are praised endlessly and can practically do no wrong, even though there are serious issues with both. Sakharov in particular is elevated literally to the level of a modern saint by Remnick: he is never mentioned without describing his "saintliness", "superior morality", and so on. Now in many of the cases Remnick's qualifications of his interviewees seem deserved, but it does get annoying after a while. Better to let readers decide whom they like than to pre-ordain all this.Overall, the book is mostly useful as a collection of interviews of important people at the end of the 1980s, and as such it is very balanced in the kind of people interviewed. It fails entirely as anything more though, and should not be used as a serious explanatory book on the hows and whys of the USSR's collapse. And that is somewhat disappointing.

I would never have purchased this movie if I had known that it was the feature only. Yes, I know, in my excitement to get the movie, it was my own fault for not looking carefully at the back of the box, although, nowhere could I find that it says feature film only. I used to download movies illegally. I stopped and started buying them legit again because the special features are really enjoyable. When the companies charge full price for the feature only (which i can get from netflix anyway), I feel cheated. Maybe everyone should start downloading illegally and really send hollywood or whoever a message that if they want our hard earned money they need to work a little harder for it. This is just my rant.

review/text: I spent the first 13 years of my life as a career woman and then we decided to start our family. It was very important to me to have one of us there to raise our own children (not daycare) so we waited until we had purchased our first house and we found that my husband's job was sufficient to cover our needs. This meant that we got a little later start than most and we had a few less toys than some, but it was worth it to both of us! 30 years later, I lost my husband and had to make some hard decisions again, as I still have two young children at home. After allot of research and creative thinking, I opted to turn a hobby of mine into a job that I could do from home. It isn't easy, I don't draw a huge income, but it makes ends meet and I can give the same TLC and attention that I gave to my older children to my younger two.I agree strongly with the author, if you have children, then you need to fit the career to the children, not the other way around. Children deserve our best, not our leftovers at the end of the day, after all, they are not an accessory and they need and want our focus. I enjoy my children and my career, though after losing my husband, I was told that the only option that I had was working full time. I am sorry, but those nay sayers don't give women enough credit! How sad that so many leave their young children for other's to raise, simply because they don't believe that staying and/or working at home is an option!

review/text: This is a nasty, mean-spirited book that exhibits contempt for the Torah and Torah values. When I picked up this book at the local library, I assumed that I would just love it and want to buy a copy for my college-age daughter (who is also a cat-owning Rabbi's daughter). But this isn't just some loveable cat regaling us with home-spun, and potentially Torah-based wisdom. No, this cat uses bad language, is obsessed with masturbation and, on occasion, likes to grab the nearest lady cat and "show" her (and us, unfortunately) a thing or two. (Anyone for cat pornography?) Oh, and the lovable rabbi ends up desecrating Shabbos (the Sabbath) and eating trefe (non-kosher) food in a crisis of faith brought on by finding out that his daughter's new husband is not strictly observant and his family is not at all observant. Warning: this book is not suitable for children!

One of those movies I can watch over and over and it gets funnier each time. Our poor hero has a mind numbing job, answers to 5 bosses and is asked to take on extra work as they proceed to lay poeple off.Favourite scene has to be the beating death of the despised fax machine, anyone who has worked in an office can totally relate and probably do as I do and play that scene over and over as some sort of catharsis.Highly recommend this movie

review/text: In the book Fahrenheit 451 the main characters name is Guy Montag. Guy is a fireman that burns books and sets houses on fire instead of the normal fireman that puts out the flames. During the course of the book Montag goes through many different phases. The most important phase is where he starts wondering about books. Since all his life he has been taught that books are bad and only to burn them, he is curious what books are about. During the time that he is going through his mysterious phases he meets a girl named Clarisse McClellan, who opens her eyes to the emptiness of his life. Montag met this girl one night when he was taking a walk at about midnight. Montag also meets a very important character named Faber. Faber is an old English professor that likes books and knows a lot about them. Over the story Montag has Faber set him up with a retired publisher, to help publish books. At the time that Montag is trying to publish books the fireman are chasing him, because his wife turned him in.Guy Montag is a fireman who suddenly realizes the emptiness of his life and starts to search for meaning in the books he is supposed to be burning. He quickly forms unusually strong bonds with anyone who seems to have true friendship with him. His biggest regret in life is not having a better relationship with his wife. And because he didn't have a very good relationship with his wife that is why she turned him in to the fireman and got there house burned.The way that Ray Bradbury makes this book seem is incredible. He has a special talent that lets him really involve and capture the reader's attention. while I read this book I felt as if I was a silent observer that stood next to Guy Montag every where he went. I loved this book, and would definitely recommend this book to anybody who loves a great adventure and thrill.

I tried to get into this book four different times but could never get past the first 75 pages. The best part of reading this book was that it served the same purpose as taking a sleeping pill. Each time I picked up it allowed me to fall asleep within ten minutes. A better name for The Third Secret would have been Ambien ... The Book. Virtually nothing happened in the limited time I read the book,the plot moved at a snail's pace and the characters did not hold my interest. The old saying about books defintely applies as an argument for not reading The Secret Secret, i.e., so many books, so little time. Do yourself a big favor and avoid any temptation you might have to read this book. It ultimately will serve as a waste of your valuable time, not to mention a waste of your money. The only reason stopping me from giving this book a 1-star rating is my guilt in not spending more time to give The Third Secret a chance to improve. However, for me, the secret about this book was already out of the bag, so to speak. That is, that after 75 pages it was no secret that The Third Secret was a real snoozer.

I will say that I wish it had more in common with the game... too much was changed, in my opinion. Luigi is a young guy (with no moustache!), Toad is some kind of hippie, and the Goombas are shrunken-head dinos. I suppose most people would expect things to be more similar to the original, just like they'd expect a movie based on a book to be similar. I also got the impression that the writer/director really wasn't familiar with the game, maybe that's why there were so many changes. In any case, it is always tough to take a story from one media to another, and it seems to me that the efforts more often than not fall short of the mark.

The theological movie brings action,love and a little sci-fi to the table with the classic good vs. evil genre. Keanu Reeves plays John Constatine a chronicaly depressed over smoker. John who wish is to go to heaven but after attepted scuicde he already to late. So he trys to buy his way into heaven by sending excorcized demons back to hell. After a brief talk with the angel Gabrielle he finds that this wouldn't work so he goes deeper into dispare. Along the way he meets a cop who twin sister has commited suicide played by Rachel Weize. As she follows him through all the madness of his work she soon finds that guns will not get rid of evil but only faith can. As the plot thickens johns preiest freind dies by the hands of a demon half-breed and john grows ever wearry of his task. The movie action and special effects are awesome. Near the end john must sacrifice himself to save weize and its then when lucifer comes to collect his soul but as the scriptures say slef sacrifice earns you into heaven but lucifer will not let this happen so he keeps john on earth by removing the cancer that was ticcking john closer to death. In my opinion this was the best movie of the year and Im sorry if the die-hard fans of hellraiser didnt like the movie but get over it some things need change to be better. All in all i wish they would have a ten star system but even then i would try 11.

Who can not help laughing at sentences like &quot;Chopin distrusted Jews, but that's the way Poles are.&quot; The French, English, Germans, and Hungarians: Huneker comes up with some interesting stereotypes for them too. Many of the facts are incorrect, as the editor supplies the corrected facts in the footnotes on nearly every page of the text. And the music discussions have the spirit of &quot;What a powerful melody! However, I believe the third note of the 14th measure of Etude 12 op. 10 should be an F sharp, though it's written differently in some scores.&quot; What a snore. I suggest looking elsewhere for real information about Chopin and his music. This book offers no insights though some occasional unintended laughs.

review/text: It's great to see this in print again, but I was aghast when I opened it to find the original Stephen Gammel illustrations missing. Most of my friends read these books as children, and we all remembered the delightfully creepy illustrations long after we had forgotten the stories themselves. Gammel's artwork often broke the fourth wall and put the reader right into the story, so that YOU were walking down a lonely road beside a shadowing figure, and the skeletal haunt was coming straight at YOU. Brett Helquist is an excellent artist, and his drawings are nice, but they are simply ordinary illustrations. This new edition of Scary Stories is just that, ordinary. Scary Stories to Tell in the Dark is no longer an iconic book that will always, always be checked out of the school library and remembered for decades by every young reader. It will no longer lead to a lifelong appreciation for certain genres of artwork. It's just a regular book of ghost stories that can easily forgotten as soon as the last page is turned.

review/text: Released in 2006 on Virgin/EMI, this package is by far the best available collection of hits, singles, and favorites from synth pop trio Heaven 17. Pretty much unknown in America, Heaven 17 scored a number of hit singles and smash albums in the early to mid 1980s in the U.K. and much of Europe. In America, they are best known for their lone Hot 100 charting single "Let Me Go", which climbed to #74 in 1983 and still finds a place on a number of 80's compilations today. In the U.K., they are best known for the #2 1983 smash "Temptation", which is their biggest single there.The CD clocks in at 76 minutes, making almost full use of the 80 minutes CD capacity by including 19 digitally remastered tracks, covering the band's successful, and not so successful, output from 1981 to 1988 on Virgin. The DVD features, as far as I know, all 13 of the band's promo music videos in addition to a few extras.The highlight is the CD audio remastering by Donal Whelan at Hafod Mastering, finally bringing a previously unheard clarity, dimension, and punch to these recordings. These tracks sound wonderful, and the audio upgrade alone is enough to add this collection to your cart! Even the liner notes make a reference to the band thinking that this is how these tracks were meant to be heard, only that technology was limited at the time. "It sounds tremendous, by the way. It brought a tear to my eye, for real", stated Heaven 17 member Martyn Ware.All tracks are the original album versions, except for 7" edits of "Temptation", "And That's No Lie", and "Contenders" in addition to 7" versions of "The Ballad Of Go Go Brown" and "Train Of Love In Motion". Considering official 7" edits exist for a number of other singles presented here -- including "Come Live With Me", "Crushed By The Wheels Of Industry" and "Penthouse And Pavement" -- the tracklisting isn't really consistent, as if the label had randomly picked edits over album versions. I think all 7" edits/versions should have been presented here, with the original album versions available on the 2006 remastered albums.Now on to the DVD -- Region Free and PAL format. The tracklisting: 1 Penthouse And Pavement, 2 Let Me Go, 3 Temptation, 4 We Live So Fast, 5 Come Live With Me, 6 Crushed By The Wheels Of Industry, 7 Sunset Now, 8 This Is Mine, 9 And That's No Lie, 10 Contenders, 11 The Foolish Thing To Do, 12 Trouble, 13 Train Of Love In Motion. Extras -- 1 Temptation '92, 2 Penthouse And Pavement '93. The extras are simply early 90's remixes of the original tracks using both original video footage and some random promo video footage from over the years.The DVD was produced by Abbey Road Interactive, a studio that is usually known for doing good to stunning work for the EMI label -- excellent audio/visual DVD hits packages for The Human League and John Lennon come to mind. I was let down with their work on the DVD here, which may just stem from the budget given to the studio from EMI.Abbey Road is known to reissue their promo videos with a remastered soundtrack. Unfortunately, this release is missing a remastered soundtrack on a number of videos, yet the sound on a number of other videos is in fact remastered! It's almost as if Abbey Road randomly chose videos for which to include the remastered sound. Some videos feature the audio as brilliantly remastered as the sound on the CD, yet other videos feature a mediocre mastering. Even a few videos suffer from a horrible mastering, if I can even call it that, since it's probably just the original audio that accompanied the original video source. It's almost like Virgin/Abbey Road put out a half finished product. What a shame!"Penthouse And Pavement", which is the first track on the DVD, uses the original poor quality soundtrack. Suddenly, the sound improves greatly when we get to the second track, "Let Me Go", which is not quite as sharp as the CD version. "Temptation", on the other hand, sounds like it was lifted directly from the remastered CD. Then we come to "We Live So Fast", which is rather poor, but "Come Live With Me" in it's edited 7" version sounds as crisp as the original version on the CD. "Crushed By The Wheels Of Industry" follows and sounds as poor and distorted as "Penthouse And Pavement"!That's not to say that these videos aren't worth watching. Actually, the picture quality isn't that bad. If I had to guess, these videos more than likely were pulled from their original source masters. Considering the age of these releases I can't really expect better quality than what is presented here, since some of these promos were naturally grainy with mediocre lighting and spotty darkness, such as 1981's "Penthouse And Pavement" and 1983's "Temptation". Other videos look pretty good for their age, including 1982's "Let Me Go" (maybe because it's in black and white?) and 1983's "Crushed By The Wheels Of Industry".In any case, this CD/DVD package is a very enjoyable release with the excellent CD sonic upgrade and generous 19 tracks. (And yes, that "Temptation [Original '81 Demo] is worth checking out!) The DVD, despite it's faults, is still a nice addition to the package, even if a number of the videos are very cheesy! All in all, 4 stars for a package that could have benefited from a remastered video soundtrack on ALL promos and for the random use of edits on the CD. Nonetheless, I highly recommend this compilation.

review/text: The blurb on the cover from the New York Times Book Review says: "Funny, masterly, fine... Superbly written." Like all the other books by Winchester which I have read, this is superbly written, but funny it is not. I'm not sure what the reviewer defines as funny, but after reading travelogues by Bill Bryson and Peter Mayle (which have their share of funny moments) this is a much more scholarly tome. Some of these outposts are in the middle of nowhere and you wonder how people live.I think the chapter I most enjoyed was Gibraltar - only because I know all about the roundabout trip British citizens have to make from getting from Spain to The Rock. (Okay - maybe that was the funny section.) My second favourite section was the Falklands (or should I say Malvinas?) -- I vaguely remember the war and it was nice to get a history lesson from this book. I'm sure my friends in the UK know more about this conflict that I do - but I don't remember a lot of news coverage here in the USA. (Granted, it's 20 years ago, but still - if it's not affecting the USA, the news kind of just skates over it quickly, if it's mentioned at all.)It's fine writing, makes you think about places that you might never otherwise heard of, but at times it's dull and reads more like a history text than a travelogue.

They act good in their versions and are young enough to be believable as Emma.PS: The guy playing Knightley in this movie is too old too.Jeremy Northam and Mark Strong are way better Knightleys.

review/text: My wife and I had a rare opportunity to find a babysitter and head out to a Sunday movie. Not knowing what was out, we began exploring ratings and reviews on Amazon and Google. While not in the mood for a horror movie, we decided to see The Descent anyway, simply because it was rated extremely high compared to everything else.So, with popcorn in hand, we rolled past previews and into The Descent.The Descent is a story of a British woman and her group of friends who enjoy extreme adventures such as rafting on rapids, rock climbing, and even base jumping. After a tragedy, the reunite in the Appalachian mountains to explore a cave. It is here that the frights begin.Without giving away spoilers, I will mention some aspects of The Descent that my wife and I discussed in the car after the movie.First and foremost, we were surprised at how much blood and gore was in the film. It wasn't needed, and many times felt out of place. The blood and gore became very distracting. We both feltit was over the edge and took away from the story. Blood isn't scary in and of itself, and after a while it loses its shock value.Secondly, there were too many cheap frights in the movie. By this I mean unexpected scenes meant to stop your heart that come out of the blue and really have nothing to do with the plot. The beginning and ending of The Descent feature scenes like this. (and no, they were black cats jumping out of shadows)Third, while the acting was good, the characters were forgettable. One month from now I won't remember either the actors or their characters.That brings me to the fourth point: while entertaining, The Descent was forgettable. My wife and I agreed strongly on this point. In a year from now we most likely will be browsing the video stores and come across The Descent. I can hear the words now, "Did we see that? I can't remember? Was that the movie..."Spoiler alert....Lastly, the ending was out of place. The main character does something to another character that wrecked the film for us. Earlier in the film, Juno is under attack and swings arounf wildly, only the land a climbing pick that goes all the way through another characters throat. That character can't speak, and drops to the group. While on the group, blood pours from this character's would at a fast and furious pace. There is a scene where you can literally see the blood pouring to the ground at a shocking rate. The stream from the wound is about an half inch thick. In any case, Juno leaves her for dead. My wife and I didn't blame her. This woman was toast with that kind of blood loss.But, alas, the woman didn't die and is still doing OK twenty minutes later in the film. Can you say hokey? I knew you could. Juno is then left for dead by the main character. The main character comes off as a bigger fool that Juno. At least Juno didn't kill on purpose.And then the main character fleas, only to give us another part deux of the cheesy ending: a heart stopper in the getaway vehicle. The end of the Descent contained two scenes that were out of place and ruined the movie for us. Nuff said.The movie was scary, the acting good, the story was pretty good, but the directing and the fleshing out of the characters in the script left us happy to ascend from The Descent.It is worth seeing, but my wife and I both agreed:1) We would not see it again2) We would not buy it on DVD3) We would be hesitant to recommend it to many of our friendsTotal Score (out of 100) = 4820 (out of 50). Enjoyment. A rating based on my overall enjoyment of the film.7 (out of 10). Acting. How good was the acting?8 (out of 10). Immersion. Did the movie suck me into the story?8 (out of 10). Intangibles.

review/text: Every few minutes, I kept saying, "I have LIVED this movie. I have WORKED with those people. I have SUFFERED in that cube farm." And I laughed. I laughed harder than I've laughed at a movie in years. I laughed because it's dark and raw and cynically funny, not because it's what passes for comedy these days (raunchy sex and language that would make a sailor blush--though that can be funny too; see JAY AND SILENT BOB STRIKE BACK for a great example).Mike Judge (of BEAVIS AND BUTTHEAD and KING OF THE HILL fame) brings to life a Dilbert-esque fantasy through the eyes of everyman Peter Gibbons, cube farm dot-com slave working on fixing the Y2K problem and hating every moment of his miserable work existence. He's got eight bosses (one of whom is played by Gary Cole in a performance so magnificent that you will wonder if he shadowed your boss for a few days to get acting tips--he's that realistic), all of whom jump his case whenever he makes mistakes. He's surrounded by the lady with the annoying voice, co-workers cursing at a broken fax machine, the old timer who sees layoffs around every corner...and Milton, the weird guy we've all seen in our offices, the mumbler, the nervous wreck, the guy we all take bets on when he'll snap and go postal. A visit to a hypnotherapist turns Peter's life around, and he stops caring about his job...just as two efficiency consultants arrive to review company practices and procedures. But instead of getting fired, Peter gets a promotion while his two best friends get fired, and the three of them plot to take their revenge on the nameless, faceless corporation making their lives miserable.Look for Jennifer Aniston in a very nice small role as a waitress at a TGIFriday-esque restaurant who becomes Peter's girlfriend and learns to stand up for herself at her job. Look fast or you'll miss Orlando (7-Up) Jones in a bit part that is so funny and so real that you'll wonder how long he studied those guys who go door-to-door with the magazine subscriptions. But most of all, look at the atmosphere of this film and marvel at how eerily accurate it is. They say you know your job stinks when you think of Dilbert as more autobiographical than funny; your job is really terrible when you can spot your office in OFFICE SPACE. See it soon!

review/text: The novel 'Fahrenheit 451` written by Ray Bradbury and published in 1953 takes place in a futuristic dystopian society. The totalitarian state forbids books and most of the people don't question it or offer no resistance. Guy Montag, the main character of the novel, is one of the firemen, who have the assignment to burn books. Until he witnesses, that an old woman wants to die with her books, Guy Montag doesn't question any orders and even likes his job, but after that experience he begins to think about the meaning and power of literature/books and history.The novel 'Fahrenheit 451` shows, what kind of terrible things censorship can do to a society and the importance of free speech. We need to think for ourselves and never accept everything. The author maybe wanted to express a warning through this novel about a society we might have to live in some day. I think this novel is suitable for school reading, because it includes important topics which can be discussed well in class with a teacher, although I didn't really enjoy reading it. It's not a book I would like to read in my freetime, but in class there might be interesting topics to think and discuss about.

review/text: It's a difficult country to gain respect in, America that is, for foreign musicians...Especially those who don't care to be recognized for their cute gimmicks or for novelty. Cibo Matto, though acclaimed for their debut Viva La Woman!, have masterfully and elegantly avoided being artistically restrained to one idea or concept with the eclectic release Stereotype A. This record is groundbreaking for the band and is, perhaps, an affirmation of the strength of good pop music everywhere. While Viva La Woman was symbiotic in themes and musical textures, Stereotype A is all over the map stylistically and in focus. 'Working for Vacation' is a crazy stomp through electronic breaks and middle eastern melodies, while 'Blue Train' is a heavy metal anthem making you check your decks to see if you're still listening to the same record. 'Sci-Fi Wasabi' will please Cibo fans who are fond of Viva's girlie shout-outs, and 'Spoon's get-down-on-the- get-down funkified bassline will have even the most boring of you bobbing your heads. A great element on this album that was a bit underdeveloped on Viva is the inclusion of several ballads. 'Moonchild' is an amazing tune showcasing Miho's pipes better than even 'Birthday Cake'. My favorite track is definitely the gorgeous 'Sunday part 2'. Lyrically and structurally, it is one of the most beautiful songs I have had the privelege to hear in a long time. Overall, Cibo Matto have established themselves as an important element in pop music and we can surely expect a great deal of amazing material in the future from them.

Some of my first pages were made with Microsoft FrontPage, but when things didn't work (because of sloppy code, etc) I turned to The Complete Reference. I still use editors as a crutch, but this book is steering me towards understanding bugs and giving me the knowledge to write my own code if I should ever be so inclined/crazy!

I liked Invisible and This is the Night because they were familiar but was hoping for other songs Clay sang on American Idol. However, after listening to the CD several times, I can't decide which song is my favorite. I listen to it over and over at work.

Bootlegs of many of these shows are available but were recorded from nth generation tapes. Any one of these classic full shows would have been a much better choice for release than this hit and miss (mostly miss) collection of singles. I'm disappointed in this, and I believe they will be too once they see their sales numbers.

I was very anxious for it's arrival and was not disappointed when it arrived and I was able to dive into it. As with the other book, I could not put it down and it directed to me to all the places in the bible that I needed to be. It was like God was speaking directly to me. This book goes hand in hand with the other one. I have also passed this book on to a friend who needs it now more than I. It is the type of book that you can read over and over again and each time, God has something new for you to learn. This is a must read!

review/text: The key to enjoying the original Foundation trilogy is to understand that the three novels which make up the "trilogy" are not really novels. They are a series of interconnected stories written over time. Foundation is actually 5 short stories. Because of this the stories vary in quality.The second book, Foundation and Empire is actually two stories. The first is called The General, and tells the story of the empire's last ditch effort to conquer the foundation. The weakness of the first story is that all the action takes place off page. We never see any of the actual combat, we just read the characters talking about it. Also, the resolution comes way too quickly. It feels like Asimov had reached his page limit and decided to end the story as quickly as he could.The second story, called The Mule, is the real draw here. All the previous stories presented a challege for the foundation to overcome. However, it was always expected that the foundation would triumph based on the long term scientific predictions of its founder. The Mule throws in a variable that was not predicted. The appearance of a mutant who swiftly moves to conquer the various planets left in the wake of the old empire's collapse. Ultimately, he sets his sights on the foundation. The best part of the story is a visit to the ruins of the planet Trantor. Former capital of the galactic empire.Having finished this second book, I have come to realize that the Foundation trilogy, while entertaining is certainly not Asimov's best work. Time is not always kind to science fiction and all of these early stories were written before 1950, when Asimov was still a young writer. I plan to continue on to the next book, but I no longer expect to be overwhelmed by the classic status these stories have achieved.

review/text: First things first. Phil Farmer is not always the most elegant writer - often, his prose is clumsy and his characters wooden. In all likelihood, you won't like everything you read by him. He's best known for labyrinthine series (Riverworld, Dayworld, World of Tiers) and 'fictional histories' of iconic characters such as Sherlock Holmes, Tarzan & Doc Savage, which may or may not be your cup of tea. Okay, enough with the caveats: on the plus side of the ledger, he's an unduplicable and inspired madman with no fear and no restraints upon his literary curiosity. I can't think of anyone even remotely like him, ever. We desperately need more writers in his imaginative weight-class....he may be audacious and outrageous, but he never shatters taboos simply to shock and tittilate (as so many Celebrated Prose Stylists do), but simply to see what might emerge from behind this or that Forbidden Curtain. This paperback, long out of print (WHY??), is not only my favorite Farmer, but one of all time favorite books by anyone. It's the initial Riverworld novella which preceded the series (which incidentally works beautifully as a standalone work - in fact, it's so powerfully surreal and magical that the subsequent series might disappoint you, as it did me), along with a number of Farmer's most unforgettably deranged short stories, many of which sping from premises which would never have occured to anyone BUT Farmer (i.e., 'The Jungle Rot Kid On The Nod' came from Farmer's asking himself: what if WILLIAM Burroughs, rather than Edgar Rice, had written Tarzan?) Usually, in a collection of this type, the novella is the centrepiece and the rest is filler; here, nearly every single collected work is equally indelible. A couple of these stories -'JC on the Dude Ranch', 'The Leaser of Two Evils', 'The Phantom of the Sewer', and the two mentioned previously- have been etched permanently in my mind since I first read them over 25 years ago. (And though I've read quite a bit of Farmer since then, none of it has ever quite equalled this incredible collection - though there've been some close calls.) I'm sure that among sf aficionados, this early version of RIVERWORLD might be considered a nonessential larval-stage curiosity - there never seems to be a shortage of RIVERWORLD novels in print, and that may be keeping this neither-fish-nor-fowl book locked away in obscurity. But please trust me on this one - RIVERWORLD AND OTHER STORIES is Phil Farmer's single greatest collection/definitive statement, and the world needs to see it back in print as soon as possible.

review/text: I have been homeschooling our five children for the past fifteen years and consider this book and "One Minute Philosopher" to be the two most useful books for adulthood that my children read in high school. The ABC's, written by a well-balanced father of eight, and a former military man, examines many factors which contribute to marital stability or instability, including family finances, premarital and contraceptive sex, dealing with family dysfunction before the wedding, premarital inventories to examine compatibility, warning signs, getting parental opinions on potential mate, online dating and many other factors.Wood bases some of his advice on research and some on his experiences. He has an experienced, fatherly perspective, and cheers a couple on to get the support and necessary skills they need to have a stable, loving marriage. Although some of his opinions are not mandated by Catholic teaching, they are based on either traditional practices, such as involving the family in the process, or modern research, such as the use of a premarital questionnaire to indicate compatibility or lack of it.I highly recommend this book for those who are looking for practical Catholic advice from an experienced husband and father.

review/text: Reading through the other reviews posted here, I can't believe some of the things I'm seeing! To the reviewer who thought it 'bland' because he listened to a friends copy whilst at work.... do you really think 1 listen is enough to warrant a review? Or any of the reviewers for that matter?This album is a brilliant album. It's different enough from Wiretap Scars, whilst still remaining close to their roots. If you have a winning formula, why change it? The band have moved on well in my opinion. The material is fresh and a natural progression from Wiretap.The main difference that I have found so far in how the albums have grasped me, is that Wiretap grabbed me immediately, whereas the songs on Porcelain seem to have more of a 'growing on you' effect. This is not to say they aren't jsut as good if not better as the Wiretap tracks, just how it happened for me!As for the actual music, I think it's an extremely solid production, I don't find myself hitting the skip button at all when listening. Each track can stand on its own as a good track. The absolute standouts for me are Tensioning and Splinters. What amazes me about sparta is the way in which, upon repeat listens, one can pick out subtle new riffs and elements to songs not heard previously. Each track has managed to get stuck in my head at different points since i bought it, which is pretty rare! I own upwards of 150 album, and Porcelain is definately, even after only 1 month of owning it, one of my best buys ever.If there is one gripe I have with this album, and it is SLIGHT, but it is that 'From Now to Never' (brilliant track!) should end at about 5 minutes, but instead launches into a weird 3 minute slow piano driven fadeout including random french speaking, it just seems a little out of place, and disrupts the flow a little. But again, this gripe is minor. A STRONGLY recommended album for all.

It is not necessary to watch the sequel to appreciate Jean de Florette, but you will have to watch this first to make any sense of the the characters' motivations in Manon.I just wanted to comment on the review that suggested that the film-maker's motivation in splitting the two parts was financial. Look closely - the sequel takes place some 10 years later and uses the same cast. The story had to be broken up to allow everyone - especially the child Manon - to age sufficiently to continue.These are a couple of amazing films.

Lewis' witty and systematically logical defense of Christianity still endures as a favorite today. Although intellectual works of this caliber can seem intimidating, his conversational style of communication makes the book approachable and thoroughly enjoyable. He not only addresses the common sense of Christianity, but also thoughtfully doesn't neglect the practical need, the heartfelt void, that Christ alone can fill. All in all, this book is an all-around, solid work that consistently covers all the bases of thought and makes for a great read.

review/text: This is one of the most inspiring series that I've ever seen. I have seen in the online message boards how many young girls have written to the actresses, talking about how this show has inspired them to become doctors. Many women are out there without good medical care or the means to provide for themselves. This show inspires us women who have nothing to become something. It is also a really cool drama that will open your eyes to diseases and other health related issues in a way that ER will not. ER is more focused on the relationships between the actors, where this show is focused on the health issues and their impacts on the people's lives. A very, very good show.

review/text: mr. holmes was one of the masters of the hammond b-3 as this set attests. he melded the blues and jazz together in an endlessly swinging atmosphere, one that can't help but make you get off your seat and shake your behind! this album captures him in full roar toward the end of his life in 1988. &quot;blues all day long&quot; gets things off to a great start, setting the tone for the entire date. this is a soulful blues, best heard late in the evening when things are settling into a pleasant groove. &quot;killer joe&quot; shows mr. holmes could also handle funk/r-n-b. finally, &quot;groove's groove&quot; reveals just how much swing an organ can have. mr. holmes may never have gotten as much recognition as other b-3 masters like jimmy smith, jack mcduff, lonnie liston smith, or even shirley scott, but he certainly belongs in their ranks. if you can find them, his recordings for the pacific jazz label are also worth finding.

review/text: Homesickness is the second novel I've read by Bail. It reads well though not as well as 'Eucalyptus'. From my own limited experience in traveling, 'Homesickness' does an excellent job of capturing the stereotypical tourist comparing every country to their own, usually in a less than flattering manner, sending home postcards with generic statements, and trying to go native. The museums the characters of the novel visit are strange, bordering on plain weird. From the (literal) Institution of Marriage to a corrugated metal museum, Bail leads us through each one with subtle humor. His sketch of each destination is done well, especially New York City and Russia. While this is an interesting novel, though the average reader might get lost by references to various aspects of Australia culture, I liked his more recent novel, 'Eucalyptus'. I think readers who travel a lot will find much of this novel amusing and dead on. A few of the sentence structures are strange such as missing commas or the syntax in unusual order that I had to reread a second time to understand. Just before Bail dumps the Australian tourists on their last trip to Russia, he provides his own experiences in Russia, which seemed like he wanted to include this extra material for the heck of it.

review/text: My 2-year old grandson is completely mesmerized by this video. He wants to watch it all the time - and asks for it by name.There are so many good lessons to be learned from this production about what to do in case of a fire - and it is directed to the toddler in such a way that not only does it grab his/her attention - but the message that the video intends to convey is done quite well - with subliminal tones.Be prepared for a different format - an actual trip to the firehouse and a sampling of the life of firefighters with on-camera interviews and interactions. I categorize it as being more educational than pure entertainment - but what a lesson it brings to the little ones!I shared this video with the day-care that my grandson attends - and all of the little ones (toddlers) were taken with it. The mix of real life and regular Sesame Street life is just right for their level of attention and comprehension.As a grandparent of a young child - I highly recommend it as a holiday stocking stuffer. It is well worth the cost in terms of life lessons and is certainly appropriate in today's world.

The complete dominance of honor, and the constant heroism and adventure in these books is heart warming, as well as thrilling. In this part of the series, somewhat to my dissappointment, John Carter is no longer telling the story, but his son, Carthoris, is. Readers of the first three books don't be alarmed however! Carthoris is &quot;just as good a story teller as his father.&quot; And the story is just as exciting.

review/text: As you probably know, 'Who Framed Roger Rabbit' is a great movie. Unfortunately, the DVD version offers ZERO extras. No cut scenes. No feature commentary. No 'making of' featurette. And NO trailer (the back cover clearly states that the trailer is on the disc)! Isn't there some kind of law against such blatant false advertising? The picture and sound quality are good, but owners of DVD players deserve more than just a bare-bones copy of the movie, especially when it's a cinematic/special effects achievement of this caliber.

review/text: The Future is Wild is easily one of the most original and unique consepts for a film in a while. Showing the world of the far far future. When humans has gone (how or why is not explained) and the world has returned back to the primitive world is once was. This DVD version of the movie is quite different then on Animal Planet. Some new details are added it is also missing completly the space prob. My guess is the space prob was just Animal Planets form of political correctness. The Future is Wild is extremely imaginative. The bizzare future animals it predicts are very cool. Scientist explaining laws of evolution and using examples of modern animals make this future world more probable. It takes three time periods. 5 million years, 100 million years, and 200 million years in the future. As expected the more time goes on the more bizzare the animals get. 5 million years we see giant swimming birds, giant running birds, giant bats, giant rats, running lizards, desert pigs, and rattlebacked rodents. This is a world of ice were creatures are scrambling to survive in the cold. 100 million years the world has warmed up. We see turtules bigger then the largest dinosaur, amphibious octupus, giant killer bugs, four winged birds, and poisionus birds. 200 million years in the future a mass extinction wiped out all mammels, birds, and reptiles. However we have swimming lobsters, super sharks, flying fish, hopping snails, plant worms, and squid that swing from tree to tree. All of this may seem to weird to be true but the world of 200 million years ago was just as different. These future animals are shown using computer animation in live action environments. While it is clearly inferior to framestones television projects the animation is good enough to serve its purpose. This 5 hour series spans over three discs. All are presented in anamorphic widescreen. DVD lacks any special features on the animation and has only 2 channels of sound. Theres more then enough disc room for a 5.1 track and at least some extras. This is a bit dissipointing but I still recommend The Future is Wild. It is a glimse at our possible future world. Remember Evolution Never Stops.

review/text: Recently, I picked up a copy of the first book in Issac Asimov's Foundation series, for which this review is written. I will not spoil the book in this review as some others have done.The theme was quite interesting. Essentially, one man somewhat manipulates humanity into protecting its knowledge and creative abilities by setting them apart from the &quot;masses&quot;, so that they can weather the coming dark ages. The great joke of this book is that Asimov almost makes it seem as if history is pushed forward by the &quot;masses&quot; themselves but in reality, his apparent humanism and rationality comes through as he shows that it is always the &quot;individual&quot; who in the end can save or destroy humanity.If you are a man (or woman) who cares about how ideas move history, if you believe in the sanctity of the individual, if you love life, then this is a book for you.Asimov is a man of reason and he shows it well throughout this first, in what I hope to be an excellent sci-fi series. Often times, contemporary authors infuse their lack of values into their books and characters, making one wonder who one should be rooting for. Asimov paints a clear picture of the values within man that make him worthy of praise (or not) - reason, justice and a love of life.This book can proudly stand side by side with Ayn Rand's Anthem and Orwell's 1984 as a warning to society about the dangers of the &quot;irrational&quot; in all its glorious forms.

review/text: Early on in his classic "Into Thin Air", Jon Krakauer recounts how his team leader, Rob Hall, was stung when fellow New Zealander and Everest legend Sir Edmund Hillary denounced the business of "guided climbs" on the mountain. This book tends to reinforce Hillary's point of view. The author was a client on Scott Fischer's team, one of Hall's competitors, and, as dozens of others have observed, it is primarily an exercise in shallow ego gratification, and a poorly wriiten one at that. To be fair, to simply get up Everest, even with Sherpas and guides doing most of the support work, is no mean feat; nonetheless a non-climber like myself has to wonder whether these people are really entitled to claim Everest as a trophy. Her repeated blather about being the "first Scandinavian woman" on the summit seems banal, I mean, what's next, the first gay Mexican to make the top? And her constant use of phrases like "Sagamartha, Mother Goddess of the Earth" starts to sound smarmy and condescending, heck, according to Krakauer even the Sherpas mostly refer to it simply as "Everest".The point is, these guided climbs offer a great opportunity for self-absorbed overachievers to make a name for themselves while in the process diluting the achievements of true experts. After all, if (as of 1996) some 600+ successful ascents had been logged, laymen like myself who aren't a part of the climbing fraternity might easily wonder what's so special about the whole thing. Of course, these expeditions do inject lots of badly needed cash into the Sherpas' economy, nonetheless one is inclined to wonder if the "sport" of mountaineering wouldn't be better served, as Krakauer himself suggested in passing near the end of his book, by simply banning oxygen from Everest. If nothing else, it would keep the hacks and wannabes off the hill and restore the summit to its status as a place open only to the very best climbers.

review/text: I have a general rule when it comes to Gerard Depardieu, if he's playing sexy then pass but if he's playing a character then keep.Depardieu is the title character in Jean de Florette. Jean has inherited his mother's family farm. He is bringing his wife and young daughter Magnon. Jean did not grow up in the area so even though it is his family farm, he is an outsider.To further complicate things, he has a slight hunchback, which the villagers take as a curse.Caesar (Yves Montand), the farmer next door and his nephew (Daniel Auteuil) would like to buy the land and expand their holdings.But Jean looks at this as a chance to build a new life and refuses. Therefore Caesar plots to force Jean out, including stopping up his spring.Jean's new life is hard but he makes it work. That is until there is a drought. Jean eventually works himself to death. His widow sales the farm to Caesar. The final scene is Caesar and his nephew unplugging the spring but unknown to them, little Magnon sees this.Claude Beri is on of the great French directors. He has captured the flavor the rural France at the turn of the century. This is Depardieu's finest performance and is the first film that brought future French superstar Daniel Auteuil to the American filmgoer. And it is nice to see Yves Montand again.This is part one of two films call Pagnol's Water Stories. The second is the even better, Magnon of the Springs. But both films stand alone and you do not need to see both - but it is recommended.DVD EXTRAS: NONE

review/text: Over the last few years, Super Mario Bros. has evolved into a more well-received film as it has reached a cult classic status in the eyes of nostalgic moviegoers that grew up in the late 80s and early 90s. As present-day moviegoers are drowned in over-the-top, often times cheap-looking computer generated graphics in just about every film nowadays, it has become refreshing to look back at films from the 80s and 90s where higher budgets allowed large scale practical effects & set pieces to push the technological envelope. It was a time where a dab of CGI could complement or enhance the film's special effects rather than completely replace them. Films like Terminator 2, Jurassic Park, and yes, even Super Mario Bros. found that perfect balance between practical effects & CGI and paved the way for so many "unfilmable" stories to be made into films today.Although there is no denying the fact that the atmosphere of the film is a departure from the original source material, the film still successfully captures the spirit of the video game, but with a more adult-oriented twist. While the film doesn't have any of those colorfully polished, fantastical landscapes that the video game is known for, what it does offer is the same adventurous, playful spirit of the game. If you watch the film closely, you'll see that even through the dystopian, Blade Runner-esque art direction and set design, there are a multitude of references to the video games proving that for every gritty aspect of the film that seems like it doesn't fit in with the game, there are many other aspects that are taken straight from the game. References to the Bullet Bills, Bob-Ombs, Hammer Bros., Thwomps, etc. are cleverly scattered throughout the film and any fan of the game will have a blast going on a scavenger hunt to find them as they watch the film.Looking past the visual aspects of the film that do not seem to fit in even though the ties to the game are countless, the true spirit of the game is found in the enthusiastic, playful performances of Bob Hoskins, John Leguizamo, Dennis Hopper, and the rest of the cast. Sure, much of the dialogue is campy and over-the-top, but what works so well is how much fun the actors are having in the roles. And that is where this film exudes the true spirit of the games. It is a FUN adventure film just as the games were meant to be a fun journey through each level.Is it a great piece of cinema history? No, of course not. This was never meant to be an Oscar worthy film, it was simply meant to be fun, escapist, summer entertainment for kids and adults alike that gave them a break from the real world for 2 hours. It's a fine example of films from the early 90s that were just designed to be fun films to take your imagination on a great ride.So instead of feeling like you're taking a chance with this film, just sit down with a bowl of popcorn, a few friends, and an open mind and simply enjoy a film like Super Mario Bros. that isn't afraid to be a little silly and unrealistic, like so many films of today are. And just in case you need that dose of cynicism that most of today's films have, this one even has a little bit of that too.To read more about the filmmaking roller-coaster ride Super Mario Bros. went through, be sure to check out [...] for a behind the scenes look at the costumes, props, and sets, as well as what the filmmakers and cast think of the film today!

review/text: For their third album, Dredg have undergone a slight musical makeover. Make no mistake, this is still the same great band that brought you "Leitmotif" and "El Cielo," but on their latest effort, the group go for a more straight-forward, rock sound, as opposed to the sprawling concept albums of past. Each song on "Catch Without Arms" stands on it's own, and can be listened to out of arrangement and still make sense. As expected though, there is still an abundance of creativity and variety to go around. This ain't your average rock album, and just like before, Dredg still keep their signature sound intact.Now, if you have a problem with a group who streamlines their sound (what other people like to call "selling out"), keep the title of the album and it's respective song in mind. On the title track, singer Gavin Hayes lashes out at the groups record label to the point where it is so blatantly obvious and you start to wonder how they slipped this one by -- some sample lyrics: "I'm not your star, I'm not that beam of light, here to save your life, to make your wallet fat while mine is on a diet." Now, with keeping this in mind, it pretty much goes without saying that the style of this album was mainly imposed upon by Interscope records. So, don't get mad at the group if this album doesn't sound like you think it should. Despite the fact that they were under the gun to put something "Radio-friendly" out there, "Catch Without Arms" is easily one of the most unique and emotional albums in recent memory. If there is any justice in this world, this collection of songs will gain Dredg the notereity they so badly deserve. It's hard to deny the pure emotion in songs like "Ode To The Sun" and "Bug Eyes," which are, coincidentally, catchy as hell. Other songs show Dredg stepping out of the ordinary for a bit: "Sang Real" briefly touches on the group's rap-rock origins (yeah, you heard me), while "Spitshine" is pretty much the quintessential Dredg song, and "Matroshka (The Ornament)" sounds like something U2 would do and serves as a perfect closing piece to the album.If you have a problem with change and loved Dredg's first two albums, you are probably not going to enjoy or understand this album. However, if you have a broad taste in music, an open mind, and don't mind hearing the group simplify things a bit, you might discover one of the best albums of the year! Hopefully Interscope's pressuring pays off, because Dredg deserve some attention. I am now convinced that they are the #1 most underrated band of the moment. I can't recommend "Catch Without Arms," along with their previous work, enough. Anyone who appreciates music in general will find satisfaction in Dredg.

review/text: Sandwiched between Raff's monumental 1st, 3rd, and 5th symphonies, we find 2 works which are much shorter in length, scope and vision.Symphonies 2 and 4 are, however, no less enjoyable than their towering neighbors.Of Raff's 11 outings in the symphonic genre, numbers 2 and 4 are unique in the fact that they are the only 2 without an accompanying title. They are also similar in the fact that the influence of Beethoven can be keenly felt throughout. It's almost as if they are in a sense Raff's homage to the great master.And what an homage they are!Don't get me wrong, the writing is unmistakably Raffian through and through, but Raff makes no bones about the fact that Beethoven was a major influence. In fact, the opening of the final movement of symphony 4 has a DIRECT QUOTATION from the choral movement of Beethovens 9th. It is not meant to be hidden, and is guaranteed to bring a smile to your face.Now, as for this recording of Symphony 2, there is much to love.Chalk full of dynamite melodic and thematic material, every movement is an absolute winner. No favorites here, and that is a rare statement for me.The 2 overtures on this disk are very good, but to be honest, I'd rather stick with the main course.A stunning, brilliant performance, excellent recording quality and equally good liner notes earn this CD my highest recommendation.Enjoy.PS-Don't lend it to a friend.

One thing though: I don't get why the author keeps calling himself &quot;a rogue archeologist&quot;: someone has to explain to him what archeologists do. DHC is no archeologist, whatever he might think; he's a traveler, a gossip gatherer, and a free spirit, but all this has little to do with archeology. I enjoyed his open-mindedness, and the relativism with which he judges most of the theories and hypotheses considered. Going through his whole opus, I can't help noticing that this writer is a really great guy, and that his travel companions and friends must have been lucky to have met him, but archeologist? Please, give me a break. And use some proofreader, for the next edition.

review/text: Kids has gained notoriety since its 1995 release for its controversial view on the life of kids today. Some of the subjects that this movie covers are very real, indeed. Praise should also be given to the casting director for this movie, Alysa Wishingrad, who was able to choose actors who looked very real and actually appeared to fit the part that they were chosen for--the role of kids.However real they may have looked, there is just something about the performance of Leo Fitzpatrick as Telly that doesn't work. He seemed to fit into the role far too well, and at times it seems that he is overacting the part as a cocky sex fiend. For this reviewer, Telly just grated on the nerves after a few minutes.Praise should be given to the late Justin Pierce in his role as Casper, as he no doubt was created to be a very likeable character, and he succeeded with flying colors. In this movie, he appears to be the most realistic male kid on the cast, as many young teenagers could likely identify with the personality that Casper conveys.As far as the females go, it should first be noted that Kids was the first role for both Rosario Dawson and Chlo Sevigny, who played the roles of Ruby and Jennie, respectively. Sevigny's performance was stellar, as her emotions felt real, her plight was understandable. She was given all the sympathy in this film, and she earned it with excellent dramatic acting.Unfortunately, the performances of Pierce and Sevigny are outweighed by Telly, who overexaggerates his role and ultimately ruins the movie. By the end of the film, however, things will have picked up, and the climax thankfully delivers a disturbing, yet satisfying ending.The sad truth is that this movie is merely kids play (pardon the pun) compared to the things that kids are getting involved in today. Still, the events that these kids go through seem very real, and they are very real. All in all, Kids is a movie that should be seen only once or twice, to understand the controversy that this movie has rightfully garnered with its headon attack at kids' issues.

review/text: El Cielo and Lietmotif were albums for musicians, lovers, and dreamers. They took you places with their lyrics and melodies. El Cielo captured an ambience that few artists ever could.Catch Without Arms, on the otherhand, hardly justifies its purchace. It is weak lyrically as well as musically. they have simplified their sound, while recorded well, there is little feeling or soul in the music. I feel that the band was either pressured by the record company to make music that is easier for the mainstream to swallow, or they simply ran out of ideas. The lyrics sound like rejected Thursday lyrics: "You spitshined my corroded halo." Phrases are often repeated over and over, as if he can't think of anything else to say. When I listen to CWA, I feel that only six songs are worth listening to, at best, but from there, I can honestly say I enjoy only three or four of them. These songs are "Ode to the Sun, Bug Eyes, The Tanbark Is Hot Lava, and Sang Real." Everything else sounds like an old U2 album. If I wanted U2, I would listen to War, not Dredg.Finally listen to the end of the last song, Matroshka. Then listen to Peter Gabriel's "In Your Eyes." Oh my goodness! It sounds the same!

review/text: This is an excellent recording and fine tribute from the pianist to his teacher Nadia Boulanger.A few words to one of the reviewers for his questionable comments about the works of the two women composers on this album. First of all, Nadia Boulanger herself admitted that she was not a composer, but a teacher. Lili Boulanger was not a teacher but in the span of her short life of 24 years she left a small body of work of remarkable quality and inspiration very much earmarked with genius. We can only speculate on what she might have further achieved had she lived. Igor Stravinsky was 28 when he composed The Firebird and 31 when the Rite of Spring was first performed. Arnold Schoenberg was 38 when he wrote Pierrot. To compare Boulanger who was born ten years after Stravinsky who himself outlived her by over fifty years of creative life or Arnold Schoenberg who was almost twenty years her senior is a bit unfair. Furthermore composers Aaron Copland, Roy Harris and Virgil Thomson also lived into creative old age. Personal responses or opinions about a composer or artist are the right of all, but a review should be put into perspective.

This book ends with a sweet yet subtle reminder that true and successful friendhsips take vulernability and and self-less-ness.

review/text: In the Fifties Britain produced a number of well made WWII movies that recaptured the valor and victories of British arms. The war was past and the civilian deprivations that had lasted well after the war were going away. It was time to celebrate what Britain had accomplished. The Man Who Never Was is among these movies. It tells the true story of Lt. Cmdr. Ewen Montague (Clifton Webb), a barrister who now is in Naval Intelligence, who has been charged to come up with a scheme that will convince the Germans that the Allies will not mount a major effort to invade Sicily. His solution is named Operation Mincemeat, and involves using a body as a decoy. I won't go into the details because the fun is in seeing just how Montague and his small staff, an aide and a secretary, go about it. But having accomplished their assignment, they are faced with the likelihood that the Germans will try hard to verify what they are being led to believe. The second half of the movie is a tight little drama where Montague has to outwit an Irishman who has become a German agent.Webb is quite effective playing Montague. There's almost none of the prissiness he brought to most of his roles. He's quiet, determined and smarter than many around him. He has a sharp tongue but seldom shows impatience. It's a nice job. Gloria Grahame plays a young woman who provides an important piece of evidence establishing the body's history, and then unknowingly faces the Irish agent.In my view, this is a very watchable film that keeps moving at a good pace. Ronald Neame was an experienced, effective director who knew what he was doing. Two of his best films and well worth watching are The Horse's Mouth and Tunes of Glory.And for those who appreciate a stiff upper lip and immaculate British manners, here are some of those Fifties WWII movies to track down: The Colditz Story, Ice Cold in Alex, The Battle of the River Platte, Ill Met by Moonlight, I Was Monty's Double, Above Us the Waves, The Cruel Sea. I like them all.There are no extras to speak of. The DVD picture looks very good

review/text: Daughters of Darkness is the second book in the Night World series and centres around three groups of people - Mark and Mary Lynette Carter, two siblings who are wannabe astronomers, Rowan, Kestral and Jade Redfern, three vampire sisters escaping the confining life their previous home the vampire conclave, and Ash Redfern, their elder brother who's come to drag them home and successfully has L.J. Smith fans swooning in the aisles.It is an interesting premise, and things start to heat up when the girls arrive at their great-aunt Opal Burdock's house in Briar Creek only to find her staked through the heart. Panicking, they bury the body in the garden outside, but are witnessed by Mary-Lynette who's watching the stars on the hill overlooking the house. Doubtful that Mrs Burdock is really dead, Mary-Lynette and her brother nevertheless investigate, and come across the vampire sisters hunting in the wood...However, because Mark and Jade fall pretty fast for each other a truce is made and the sisters share their fears with the two siblings - something is out there, something that's killing things, and all of them work their dectective skills to figure out who it is ... Ash? Bunny Marten, the shop attendant with the lamia name? Jeremy, the garage worker with a deep, dark secret? A vampire hunter?And then Ash turns up, and to his and Mary-Lynette's horror, they find they are soulmates, destined to be together even though Ash is not a very nice guy.The story is pretty interesting, and it's fun to guess whodunnit, though I admit I was a *little* disappointed as to the murderer's motives. L.J. Smith obviously had fun designing the three sisters, all with different personalities and features. For once there wasn't a contrived happy ending that is so popular in L.J. Smith's books, and the atmosphere of the book was very well done too - the desert-like Briar Creek gave a sense of being trapped in the middle of nowhere with a wild beast on the loose, and chemistry between all the characters was realistic, poignent, and sometimes funny. (Watch out for Ash giving Jeremy a hard time).All in all, this was a much better book than the first 'Secret Vampire', which extented the Night World a bit, and mingled together characters that have been in previous books (Ash) and characters who'll appear in future ones (Quinn).

review/text: Let me start off by saying that if you are an F1 fan especially a technical one(like myself) you can't pass up this book. If you do not know who Giorgio Piola is, he draws for the weekly magazine AutoSport. He is one of the best artist I have seen. His technical drawings allow you to understand the F1 cars in a technical perspective. Compared to the last edition &quot;Technical Analysis 98&quot;, this one is even better. If you don't have the 98 book you should order that one too. I do like the 99 book since it is written in english only as opposed to the 98 which is in italian and english, but thats not a problem. What will really impress you is the attention to detail of the drawings, but they are so easy to understand. Again this is a must for any F1 fan. Hope you enjoy it as much as I did.

When their father goes out on a long fishing trip the children stay at home alone. On one of the days they are alone Ivan's video game batteries go out so he hooks up the radio battery to it, even though he is not supposed to since that is their only way of communicating with the outside world. When he does this the radio breaks and they go out to get a new radio. The only way Ivan and September can go anywhere is on a boat but they are not supposed to and dig up clams to earnm money to get a new radio. On one of the clam digging days there is a large storm but since they do not have a radio the do not know the weather so they get in the middle of a very large storm.

review/text: Like an extended music video, Run Lola Run is one of those visceral movies that can be watched passively for while but before long it gets under your skin making your heart pound your lungs heave and your mind race. Tom Tykwer's direction and writing turned out a fantastic film that is pure action. This is a foreign film but its concept and style are close to home. Using the universal appeal of driving beats, as well as techno tunes and fast action photography this film is one that immediately grabs hold of teens and young adults and older people too! Franka Potente is powerful in this film. She is aesthetically pleasing (as always) and really makes the film enjoyable to watch. The dialogue is quite simple and you need not know a lick of German except maybe die tasche (the bag) which is a line used often throughout.The film is centered on a young arty couple who are in need of money to pay off a loan after getting the. I am not going to give away a single plot detail because it may make the movie less enjoyable. However the movie is in fact three different scenarios of what happens in their pursuit of get back the money. Not all of these scenarios end happily. I have always imagined the movie as the imaginings of the couple as they plan and go through the contingencies of getting money.Stylistically this movie is shot a lot like a music video and is more emotionally stimulating than is an intellectual one.Its adrenalizing driving feel is refreshing especially considering it is a foreign film. So often foreign films are intellectual or just quaint. Not here. The only omission I would have made was the use of the animations that run in a few parts. They aren't bad and do not heavily detract but they are a little bit like something out of the `80's. But overall, the heavy use of high energy volume fast action shots, aggressive dialogue against a relatively austere urban German backdrop that accentuates the action makes this such a fun film to watch.Beware when watching this movie you will probably want to do some cardio and this makes a great one to watch while on the treadmill if you have such a set up. This movie is pumped with energy and is a great point of entry into foreign film. It is one that is highly accessible very stimulating and good for a wide audience. I highly recommend you see this one: Its style pushed the envelope of what a film can be and is truly a masterpiece. The DVD offers a few extras and English audio which makes it all the more easy to watch.-- Ted Murena

review/text: But sometimes it seems that way and for New York lawyer Ron Sinzheimer, on October 9, 1998, it was beyond dangerous, it was deadly. There aren't any more General Aviation accidents here than other parts of the country and there's nothing particularly stunning about this one so there's little reason to remember it. A man and the family dog in a single engine Grumman Traveler flying into the Cape to link up with his wife and son at their vacation home. Because I remember this accident, live nearby in Brewster, and it speaks to something of keen interest to me, my perception of the book may be quite colored and thus this &quot;five-star&quot; review. Nevertheless Phaedra Hise has written a compelling story that will be of interest to a much broader audience than GA pilots and people who live on the Cape.The challenges associated with flying to and from the Cape are all to do with weather, specifically fog and haze. That means &quot;instrument flight rules&quot; and talking about flying as different from &quot;visual flight rules&quot; as night is from day. Besides the personal tragedy to the Sinzheimer family, the thrust of Hise's book is that once a pilot has lost visual reference to the horizon things very quickly begin to unwind. It takes a sharp pilot to sort out the conflict between what his senses say - &quot;i'm turning&quot; - and what the instruments read - wings are level. PILOT ERROR is too innocuous a description for the multitude of things (mostly bad) that are taking place in such situations. Sometimes the various instruments seem to be contradicting each other and you must fight the panic that comes when your mind screams that it needs a visual reference in order to understand.Hise could have used a famous case that everyone would have remembered in order to get across her message that instrument flight rules are a critical skill for any GA pilot. The struggle with understanding what his instruments were telling him was the same for John F Kennedy Jr when he was flying through haze on the way to Martha's Vineyard in 1999. Using his flight would have meant focusing on him rather than where the real story is - five small instrument dials, that GA pilots must be absolutely familiar with - lest we become an accident statistic or the subject of a powerfully descriptive and very well written book.

review/text: In the preface to this new, revised 20th anniversary edition of Catholic and Christian, author Alan Schreck reflects upon the centrality of the Eucharist at the core of the Catholic tradition as John Paul II calls us to enter the "Year of the Eucharist". This book covers all of the topics we Catholics are frequently asked about in conversation by our non-Catholic friends: Mary, the Communion of Saints, the Pope and more. The book is not only of value for its apologetic purposes, but also for any Catholic (or for individuals wanting to inform themselves about the Faith) who wants to learn more about the traditions at the core of our Church. The topics covered remain timely in an era when many are striving to understand the true teachings of the Church.

review/text: I was surprised and delighted to see this "remake". After purchasing I was, well, disappointed. I guess because the framework of the story was the same but nothing else was. The modernisation of the action was poor, the story only Ok and I didn't find it engaging except in one scene. A satisfying ending with all the story nicely wrapped up but I think the cast deserved a better story line and sticking to the original concept and doing a real remake with modern cinema techniques could have made this a four star candidate. Oh well I guess we'll never see a good modern updated version because this certainly is not it!

review/text: The most damning information that Goni found was that the Vatican had no qualms about helping "good, honest, catholics" from escaping their fates in Europe for what the did during WW2. Hundreds (maybe thousands) of SS and those who ran the 'concentration camp' system were smuggled out through Italy and Spain with the connivance of the Church and the IRC (International Red Cross). Everyone turned a blind eye to those men (like Mengele and Eichman) who used phony names on passport applications that were signed by 'fellow travelers'.In many cases Argentina would allow five or six jews to immigrate on a ship that carried SS Officers and their families so as to look magnanimous. What's worse is that Pope Pius XII, who never made public statements about the plight of the Jews before and during the war, was complicit in giving protection and succor to the perpetrators of the 'worst genocide' ever committed. In fact, none of those who were later condemned at Nuremburg or escaped, were ever ex-communicated.Monsignor Montini (who was later to be elevated as Paul VI) acted as co- Secretary of State for Pius during this time and met regularly with the groups in the Vatican who were working to help SS and others to emigrate to Argentina. Unfortunately, the Vatican still refuses to open up the Archives from Pope Pius XII and allow scholars to review documentation of correspondence between the Holy See and Buenos Aires during this time.Though many of the Argentine archives relating to those who were smuggled out of Europe were destroyed in 1996, enough is left over in other places that show who help develop the 'ratlines' that allowed these murderers to escape prosecution for their deeds. Sadly in many cases both the governments of the US and UK assisted in helping these people hide in the hope of fomenting unrest back behind the 'Iron Curtain' or using their scientific knowledge.Zeb Kantrowitz

So I'll just say this...1984 is beyond important, it is a masterpiece of relevance no matter the year you read it in. If you are being forced to read this book, don't worry. Don't be intimidated. This is one very weird, very scary, and very entertaining book. Orwell is a master at setting the creepy tone of a world without freedom, where you know that everything you do is scrutinized by unseen eyes. Yes there's definitely a strong message that is coming across. Look a little closer at the story and you'll find a potent argument against Communism, Fascism, Totalinarianism, and many more political -isms. I can't promote this book enough. It is timeless. It is horrifying. And it is real. And please forgive a total stranger for offering advice, but if you haven't read it yet, you need to.

review/text: This album title often surfaces in conversations about music, and some who don't listen to a lot of jazz are likely to hear unreserved superlatives when it is described. If those people go out and buy this, they're not likely to be over impressed on one listen. These are not easy sounds to listen to, much less enjoy, if your tastes have been bred on a diet of Kenny G or Michael Brecker.But give it a chance. This CD isn't just a recording of a man playing saxophone in front of a small combo; this is a jazz giant reaching an epiphany in his effort to express through music the raw essence of his love for God.I don't pretend to know a lot about the technical aspects of Coltrane's gift for playing the saxophone, but that's unnecessary to enjoy this. This is human expression in its purest, most unaffected form. Sit back in a comfortable chair and let this wash over you a few times. Listen to it, not as background music, but as if someone were speaking intimately to you on an important subject.I'm certain that some may still not be able to bridge the aural gap between radio-friendly pabulum and this undistilled product, but I'm equally certain that others will prize this recording as the jazz jewel in their CD collection.

review/text: I really wanted to give this product a one-star review, but the episode is such a classic that I can't bring myself to. "A Charlie Brown Christmas" is, hands down, the most wonderful Christmas special ever. Period. That fact makes this tepid attempt at a Blu-ray release all the more upsetting! The one thing above all that really cheesed me off was that the touted "digital copy" IS NOT COMPATIBLE WITH MACS!!!! How ridiculous is that? The most ubiquitous device upon which you can load digital copies is the iPod; the iPod is a Macintosh product. It stands to reason that digital copies would be compatible with Macs (as indeed every other digital copy I've ever experienced has been). But NO, not with this one. Preposterous. The next thing that was upsetting was that the price you pay for this is far, far too high for the limited content. By way of comparison, for one dollar more, we purchased the Star Trek movie (the new one) Blu-ray edition; it is a 3-disc special edition with over three hours of special features, plus a digital copy (that works on PC AND Macs!!!!). With this, you get two discs; the episode in Blu-ray and a standard DVD of the episode; an additional crappy Peanuts Christmas special (truly awful), a 10 minute making-of featurette; and of course the useless digital copy. THAT'S IT. For $19. RIP-OFF!!! I have to believe that at some point, either the price will come way down or WB will release a proper Blu-ray execution of this Christmas classic. My recommendation: save your money and wait for them to do it right!

However, after activating the GM Enhanced Data I found out that it was still not able to display some of the enhanced data such as CAM Retard, which is what I needed to set the distributor on by GM Vehicle. The standard features worked good, fast communication between scanner and vehicle, and you can clear codes without having to shut the engine down (cheaper scanners force you to have the engine off to reset the fault codes). If SPX can get all of the enhanced data working on this scanner I would give it a 5. My best word of advice before you buy, search forums and call SPX tech support to verify the data you need is available on the scanner.

Written in interview snippets with band members, associates and friends, you get a clear picture of what was actually going on with the band and behind the scenes while we were all busily worshiping Siouxsie.I learned plenty from things I must have missed reading up on since first stumbling upon the Arabian Knights video around 1981, up to and including their sad break up in 1995...Who knew that behind Robert Smith's back he was unaffectionately referred to as &quot;Fat Bob,&quot; or that PEEPSHOW was fueled most specifically by cocaine, that FEAST was hammered out in two weeks, that Siouxsie ruled the band with an iron fist (well, you HAD to know that). I still worship the music, but now I appreciate the humans who created it, whiny and childish as they seemed at times.It's a great read, I love Siouxsie's occasional foul mouth and the fact that she had the audacity to have been photographed for the cover of the book in a Burberry blouse. And you'll have fun at the end of the book highlighting all the gigs you actually saw and horrified at how many you allowed yourself to miss. (Discography and extensive index included)

review/text: This book has two major problems.One, its title is misleading. You think you are getting a quick, shortened version of an economics class, but what you are really getting is a conservative, free market view of the economy. If the title had been, Reasons Why The Free Market Is Better For The Economy, I would have a lot less problem with this book. Balanced, Hazlitt is not, and he takes a lot of potshots at Keynes with only the occasional quick nod to the problems the free market can run into. It's not that I disagree with a lot of his arguments, it's that you don't get both sides.Two, it's out of date. It was written in the 1940's. Oh, it's been updated alright. In the 1970's. A lot of economic events have occurred since the 1970's and the conservative view has some explaining to do.If you really want a balanced view of the economy you can check out &lt;50 Economic Ideas You Really Need to Know>. It's balanced, although a bit scatter shot. For a pretty balanced book, but with a left lean, try &lt;Economics Explained> by Heilbroner and Thurow, it tells a more cohesive story than 50 Ideas.

review/text: I wasn't quite sure what to make of this book at first. My exposure to nuns was quite limited as I was not raised Roman Catholic. I always saw them as these cold, austere, soulless beings in these odd outfits on the periphery of everything.Once I had completed reading, the role these women play in people's live became much more clear. Yes, there were some truly vile women who were charged with shaping Karen (Sr. Martha) but they were doing what they believed and had been taught was necessary to create strong, obedient &quot;brides of christ&quot; as was expected of them by the church.I agree with one other reviewer that there should have been more information included about what was happening in the church during those turbulent times which would have significantly aided in the readers understanding of what was happening to Ms. Armstrong.I'm very glad that Ms. Armstrong discovered that her call to understand God didn't require her to be part of that hellish order and her contributions to religeon have done more than anything those probably long forgotten superiors of hers have ever added to human understanding.There's also another book I'd recommend if you can find it &quot;Behold The Women&quot; which has many wonderful essays from women who were part of various religeous orders. It also has a large number of pictures of many orders some of which leave you wondering &quot;...who in their right mind would want to wear something like this for the rest of their lives?&quot;.

Matter of fact, this album will be your personal anti-christ. So don't listen before going to church on Sunday. But I dare you to listen while driving home hazy at 4 am thinking woulda-coulda-shoulda thoughts when drunken spirits are dancing and the girl is crying at the bar and you struck out big time. This album is aural absinthe.Strange moods this album evokes, usually dark, eerie, weird, out-of-place, awkward, but strangely beautiful too. The soundscape reminds me of a strange man walking through mountain mist, singing to himself...people avoid him because he really has problems. He stares at you and keeps singing. Creepy cool. Wanna see the darkness? The album title is absolutely congruent with the sonics.This is one of a handful of truly classic releases in the past 10 years. Most people won't understand it, but anyone can feel it. Listen to it to calibrate your emotional gauge. Lay back, clear your head, let the mist enter your ears.

review/text: I kept reading this book because on some level I was just waiting for something to happen. There were a couple of conflicts that could come to head somehow and make the book interesting in the "I'm reading a fictional narrative sort of way". However, none of these became more than hints until the very last two pages of the book. When this happens it seems like some predetermined anticlimax that you have been waiting for all along. The book fails as a narrative which is a problem when the publishers want to sell it as fiction.The problem is that it is not a work of fiction but is more a work of philosophy as story. I kept thinking ofCandideorGulliver's Travels (Oxford World's Classics). The problem is that Voltaire and Swift's works were at the bottom much more interestingly told. Island is the vehicle for Huxley to lay out his real utopia devised after a lifetime of intellectual work. The protagonist and the reader are guided around the island to learn about the pro-Buddhist, pro-hallucinatory drug, pro-sex, and anti(capitalist, communist, consumption, western education, nuclear family, etc) philosophy.This journey, as the protagonist learns and starts to internalize the teachings of the island, comes to an end based on the forces that represent the bad in the world. Poor Huxley's utopia even though isolated from the world cannot survive as the very nature of the philosophy is non-violent and acquiescent. It contains the seeds of its own destruction. I cannot help but think how much Huxley hated modernity and hoped for and sought a world beyond this one in the form of religion and drugs. For him, the struggle was not about the control of the means of production, but whether the means of production should exist. I just think he should thank his stars that he did not live to see the Brave New World in the flower as we can see it.

review/text: The film of &quot;Funny Girl&quot; was awaited with much anticipation after all the tremendous publicity given to Barbra Streisand following her stunning portrayal of Fanny Brice in the hit Broadway show. Streisand won the Best Actress Oscar for her role in the film (but had to share the award with Katharine Hepburn).The young Fanny Brice (Barbra Streisand) desperately wants to be a success in show business and after a shaky start thinks she has made it when she lands a part in a big Ziegfeld show. Ziegfeld (Walter Pidgeon) and Fanny clash over various matters connected with the show due to her strong personality but her talent shines through and she eventually becomes a major star. She meets gambler Nicky Arnstein (Omar Sharif) and falls madly in love with him. Unfortunately, his gambling habits get him in trouble with the police causing Fanny much sadness and anguish. However, she manages to overcome these problems to concentrate on her career and becomes a big Broadway star.The film was directed by the legendary William Wyler and produced by Ray Stark (who was in fact Fanny Brice's son-in-law!). The film had a superior supporting cast including Kay Medford (repeating her Broadway role as Rose Brice), Anne Francis (Georgia James), Lee Allen (Eddie Ryan), Gerald Mohr (Branca), and Frank Faylen as Keeney.Some favourite lines from the film:Barbra Streisand (to her reflection in theatre mirror): &quot;Hello, gorgeous&quot;.Lee Allen (to Streisand): &quot;Are you sure you can rollerskate?&quot;. Streisand: &quot;Can I rollerskate?&quot;.Streisand (to Walter Pidgeon): &quot;O.K. you win. You don't win fair but you win!&quot;.Due to the success of &quot;Funny Girl&quot; a sequel was made (in 1975) called &quot;Funny Lady&quot; with Streisand again and James Caan as Billy Rose. Omar Sharif also returned in a cameo role but the sequel was not as popular as the original. &quot;Funny Girl&quot; was one of those rare occasions when the perfect part came along with the perfect actress to play it. One of the last of the great Hollywood musicals. Clive Roberts.

review/text: I was given this book the spring I turned thirteen by my favorite aunt, who had read it when she was about thirteen. It has become as beloved to me as it was to her. It is a beautifully written story about the pain and excitement that accompany the time in one's life when the things of childhood get left behind for the lures of adulthood. Sensitive, it glorifies neither state, but shows the pains and pleasures of each. I wanted to buy if for my younger sister, and am devastated that it is out of print. If you can find a copy, do. It is infinitely worth the time. But be warned, you too will want to pass this treasure on.

review/text: The only reason I am writing this is because of that Time Warner commercial that keeps playing on TV was driving me insane! Now I mute the sound every time it comes on. I kept thinking, "Why are they showing this local musician on this ad?" Then I found out VC is a very popular singer, so I gave this CD a chance by listening to the preview clips above (maybe the ad did not do her justice, I thought). Well, the same weak,thin, and out-of-tune voice is still there. If you're over 14 years old and like this music, consider yourself tone-deaf (I'm a classically trained guitarrist who has played longer than VC has been alive, BTW). I think she does have some ability on the piano (I'm assuming that's her on the piano), though.

This card has the best quality DVD playback I've ever seen. 3D Performance is on par with Nvidia's current offerings, but more than adequate for games currently on the market (especially with the newest CATALYST drivers from ATi). Also excellent for video capture. The analog video capture rivals much more expensive professional products.

review/text: This is indeed a book of 3-line poems passing itself off as haiku. This is not harmful certainly UNLESS an unwary reader picks it up and assumes that it is, basing all future opinions of this delightful poetic form on The Haiku Year.&quot;There are those who regard haiku as a kind of 'do your own thing' poem, and never consider its foundations. But the haiku, as soon as it goes beyond the beginner's efforts, becomes a matter incorporating traditions and established values, aesthetic and otherwise, and can not be written well outside them.&quot; - Robert Spiess

review/text: I usually buy the salted version of this butter since I mostly use it for spreading and for that I like the flavor of the salted version better. That being said, there are a number of recipies that call for unsalted butter and then the unsalted Lurpak is as good as you will find.Note that Lurpak is cultured butter (not sweet cream butter like most American brands) and as such it has a deep and rich flavor that no simple sweet cream butter can match. Cultured butter of this kind is produced by fermenting the cream with lactic bacteria that convert sugars to lactic acid before churning the cream into butter.In my opinion, the Lurpak Danish butter holds its own in comparison with far more expensive butters. I actually prefer Lurpak over brands like Echire, etc.

I must tell you that the &quot;Lord Thy God&quot; really is on your side, and that you really have been called to do all that you do; Singing, Ministering, and blessing the lives of such young girls and boys in ways that you will probably never know. You and your songs are a gift to both me and my children, Cierra and Maliek. Thank You! I would also like to let you know that I just recently found out that my father is a big fan of yours. That makes me feel really good because he is a hard one to please. You are an ispiration to Maliek because he wants to be able to sing just like Bryan (his big brother). By now, I hope you know who I am and remember, You are Loved. Keep living for God, doing his will, and you will receive an even greater anointing on your life. Jesus Cares For You! I can truly relate to every song on the Cd, &quot;Growing Up&quot;, especially, &quot;My God&quot;. You were so right when you said that the devil wants us to believe that God doesn't care and that he won't forgive. But for anyone, that may be in doubt, just know that God is true to his word: He will never leave you, nor forsake you. God, Can't lie, and God can't fail. Be blessed Bryan and continue to do the work and the will of God. For all that may be reading this, Bryan is truly sincere, caring, full of wisdom, and he really has the love of Jesus for every one. He is fearfully and very wonderfully made.

review/text: In the early days of flying, few people had the amount of experience of flying in the Arctic that was possessed by Bernt Balchen. He extended that experience when he joined Admiral Richard Byrd for exploration of the Antarctic and became the first man to pilot a plane over the South Pole. During World War Two, Balchen joined the US Air Force as a Colonel and flew hazardous missions to help the Norwegian Resistance fight the Nazis. He and a handful of pilots also flew planes between Stockholm, a neutral hotbed of allied and axis spies, and Scotland. They carried a mixed group of spies, secret types, Norwegian resistance fighters, and one night they carried me. I was interned by the Swedish Government when my bomber crash-landed in Sweden. When I was released, a Balchen plane carried me out while it dodged German night-fighter planes over Norway. Balchen's motto was, "Vee do it," and he certainly did. The book is a fascinating story by a courageous man.

He plays a kind of derranged villian who hasn't a problem killing another person (except children).

review/text: As a response to one of the reviews that speaks quite highly of this novel, I would like to say that despite my understanding and comprehension of the book, I still found it entirely dull, boring, and a waste of my time. Since it was required of me to read this book in school, I was forced to make my way through each dragging chapter, but I would have never on my own time, and it's not because I didn't understand the book that I feel this way about it. My class discussed quite thouroughly about the book's symbolism, which was Golding's intention to start out with. Despite its hidden meanings, the novel still remains absolutely ridiculous in the sense that these young British boys turn completely salvage and kill their fellow islanders. If the book was looked at through a totally symbolic perspective, it would make more sense, but in order to understand its symbolism, one still has to read it, and it is really not worth it.

review/text: I am not saying that this is a bad movie or bad story... not at all. But here are the disappointments that might hit you:1. One of things that might disappoint the audience is that it cannot be easily swallowed after Russel's great movie &quot;Gladiator&quot;. 2. Second when you say Al Pacino, we remember his greatests &quot;Heat&quot; or &quot;Devil's Advocate&quot;. So this movie does not easily fit with many of his great movies.So the success of this movie is no more determined by the actors past successful history, but only if the story is good or not. And yes the story was good and had its certain type of suspense but it gets in a frame that we all knew about this story and now it has got out.In other words, we always believed that smoking cigarettes is an addiction. No this film told us why and how. So it's not new, but now it is out.I see that this type of story needed not such expensive great actors except to attract more audience!

review/text: I had looked forward to this book, as I enjoyed "The Romanov Prophecy" as a fun summer read. Unfortunately, Berry's allowed his religious and social views to turn his latest book into a screed. The hero's antagonist is a cardinal that believes in priestly celibacy and other traditional Catholic dogma, which makes him not merely wrong-headed but a scheming, blackmailing, cartoon villain who does everything but twirl his mustache as he ties the heroine to railroad tracks. The "secret" that Barry's concocted is intended to be "provocative" in the model of "The Da Vinci Code," but instead the revelation manages to be both hilarious and (there's no other word for it) blasphemous at once. Save your time and your money.

review/text: I bought this unit recently as i wanted a personal media player with good facilities and a large storage capacity (I bought the 8GB model). The unit looks lovely, has a very nice user interface, and excellent sound and picture quality.I bought an 8GB micro SD HC card to increase the total storage to 16GB.Here's the catch. The firmware in the unit is buggy; this makes the player unreliable and very annoying to use.After doing a full charge (12 hours), I loaded up the player from WMP11 in MTP sync mode - this requires you to sync to 2 separate devices: internal memory and external card. Once I had completed the upload, which took several hours, I removed the USB cable and the player rebooted.Ever since then, it has intermittently refused to power up. Sometimes when you switch it on, after displaying the Sansa splash screen for a few seconds, it simply switches itself off, freezes or crashes. On other occasions it gets stuck, saying 'refreshing database'. This occurs about 50% of the time, even after a full charge cycle. It seems to be worse if you have left it switched off for over 24 hours.I downloaded the Sansa firmware updater and installed the latest firmware update (01.03.02A) but this has not fixed the problem. I have to say I am frustrated by these bugs which spoil an otherwise fine product. I am consequently returning this product to Amazon, and will continue to look elsewhere for a personal media player.

review/text: There are only two real characters in this drama, narrated in Trevor's usual spare, sparse style that puts you into the heart of things. There's Felicia, a somewhat plain teenage girl from a depressed industrial town in the Irish Republic. She's the product of a convent school, but only on suffrance because her father tends the convent's gardens. She's inexperienced and naive and when Johnny Lysaght comes along and turns her head, her subsequent pregnancy is no surprise. And there's Mr. Hilditch, a fifty-something catering manager at a factory in the English Midlands, who lives by himself and fancies young girls, though he's very careful &quot;not to shop near home,&quot; as he thinks of it. Felicia runs away from home in search of the absent Johnny, but she finds it's not easy even to survive, much less to locate an errant Irishman, in England. She's a bit suspicious of Hilditch when he tries to help her out, but he arranges things to reduce her options, and Felicia is suddenly in very great danger indeed. Trevor does a terrific job getting inside the head of a pleasant, mild-mannered psychopath, allowing the reader to gradually understand what makes him tick. He won the Whitbread Prize (again) for this novel and he deserved it.

review/text: This book is so boring that doctors should recommend it to those with insomnia because it'll put you right to sleep. Billed as an erotic book of essays, it did not succeed with its task.The author seems to dwell in his promiscuity, but bores us with stories about his furniture and odd stains on his upholstery instead of telling us how those stains got there.In another essay he tells of his dying lover in the hospital and the last time they performed together, then, at the funeral, his lover's nurse comes to tell him that he was &quot;with&quot; the lover several times--and the author thought that was comforting. Yet there were no details of any of these couplings.There is a point when trying to write erotica intelligently, which I am all for, that the writer inadvertantly eradicates all hints of passion and heat. The author completely leaves his readers cold and unmoved and still not in the mood, which is unfortunate. This book could have been very steamy and still maintained its dignity had the writer moved into the scenes and relived the physicality of his sessions. But no, we are to read about distant memories that have no feeling or touch attached.Instead of this book being labeled and marketed as erotica, it should have been listed as autobiographic...and if these are the highlights of a life, I feel sorry for the subject--how can one lead a life so boring?

I havnt read any of the authors other works, which may be a little more deserving. Anyhow, the book is genuinely origional. The idea of a story that goes through a whole family's rise and fall was great, the repetiton of names, however much it was needed for the underlying ideology of the story, got to be a little too much for me to bear though, bordering on annoyance. The book itself never really drew me into it either, too many parts of it read like a history textbook, by the time the last few chapters rolled around I was just reading to finish it up, desperately hoping for something to save it, and the ending, however meaningful, was too little too late. The book did have its moments, dont get me wrong, but for me the cons too much outwieghed the pros.

It's not the narrative, which as the disappointed reviewer said, is primarily a trail diary--though a terrifically good one, especially if you're a trailie or trail ultrarunner. No, what's deeply inspiring is Holtel's spirit, which is unique. I swear, there's a wonderful, pure spiritual vibration in the writing.

review/text: I have been surprised just how little CS Lewis bases his theology on the Bible. He has some interesting ideas, but often writes things that are confusing or just plain untrue. He writes as though evolution is a substantiated fact, but really it is just people's ideas and it contradicts the Bible. He bases a lot of his ideas about our behavior on what seems like a good idea, with no reference to the Bible. He doesn't give the impression that he was very familiar with the Bible. He appears to have been heavily influenced by human philosophies and tries to incorporate them into a religious framework.

review/text: Out of all the movies I have seen that were made from books, this was the most terrible one I have ever beheld. I noticed a few things, but i am not going to say ones already mentioned cuz that would just be too repetetive:---According to Homer's "The Odyssey", most of the community was either incredibly buff, or wholly attractive. None of these were represented in the movie. All of the men were like little skinny rats. Crass, pusillanimous milliners. Some of the women were nauseating! Instead of fresh and striking, most of them looked dark, and many with wrinkles and other... features.---Another minus to the movie was the special effects. If the special effects had a scent, it would smell like: the putrid odor of water running down a rusty, tin overhanging onto a moldy cement below. Or maybe smell like a school cafeteria. ~~Now you have an idea how much the "special" (a.k.a. mentally challenged) effects are like.To anybody who wants to procure this movie: read the book while being inculcated by Mr. moobetoN FIRST.Bye.P.S. Thesauruses are awe-inspiring.

review/text: Michael Ball has come out with another superb album of songs from the musical theater. The choice of songs is eclectic, from the signature songs of the mega-musicals ( Les Miserables, Phantom of the Opera and Sondheim classics) as well as newer songs from more contemporary musicals. The difference between this album and his first musicals album seems to be in the story-like approach to the sequence of songs he sings here. Somehow it is reminiscent of the songs which best illustrate the life of a stage performer. This partly explains the beautiful and poignant air of melancholy that pervades the album. Michael has lifted his performance level yet even another notch -- the interpretation of the various songs gives us the depth and breadth of Mr. Ball's extrordinary musical gift. We are treated not only to his glorious voice but to his ability to deliver a performance rich with the nuances of life's many emotions. Don't miss out on this album, which should really be released in the USA. His version of Send in the Clowns and A Boy from Nowhere alone are worth the cost of this import album.

review/text: Words fail. Inspiration overflows.There is a reason that so many musicians - and non-musicians - hold this album in awe to this day.In my own humble opinion, there simply are no recordings that approach this by anyone I have ever heard. The sheer power of this music overwhelms all who can hear something of what it says. It is from the soul, but not sloppily, not "free", not randomly. It is music by absolute masters at the absolute peak of their powers. They have been assembled by their musical and spiritual leader to give thanks directly to God - whatever form that may take - with nothing between them and that "audience." What they create, what they unleash, are 4 movements of overwhelming candor, of unrivaled expressiveness. The minor blues forms are deceptively simple, hypnotic at times, but these four are masters of the blues, and the Tower of Babel they assemble on that unshakable foundation succeeds in reaching the heavens.It almost trivializes the accomplishment of this recording to praise the stunning technical mastery on display by Coltrane, Tyner, Garrison, and Jones. Rhythms fly on and off the mainline, but remain unfailingly - and at times astonishingly - true to the time. Listen to Elvin's rim shots in the first movement, amid the blurring polyrythmic overlays.This is primal scream, prayer, and devotion by geniuses. It is Picasso's Guernica, Michelangelo's David. It is my first and only nominee for greatest American contribution to world culture.For those who can't hear it, don't blame the album. Try to listen and learn the language. If it continues to make you uncomfortable, then consider the possibility that things that reach your soul hit too close to home.

The Searchers shines due to its externals, but Apache proceeds and then later culminates in a richer, deeper and more satisfying way, and the whole movie experience resonates with you in a way that The Searchers does not quite achieve.

review/text: I've been using this product for 3 months after evaluating other products such as Pharos, Navman and Socket.The strong points are:1) quick TTFF(Time to First Fix). A cold fix usually can be obtained in under 2 minutes. Make sure it is mounted with a clear view of the southern sky. You can use a velcro sticky from a crafts store if the rubber surface is not adequate to prevent sliding. Most peoiple mount it on the dashboard. Be careful in hot sunny climates as the black surface can cause the unit to overheat.2) Long Battery life: you can expect up to 8 hours with the lithium ion rechargeable battery. This is pretty good for most bluetooth receivers.3) Works well with IPAQ devices. No pairing relationship is required. This is often not the case for other bluetooth receivers.4) The mapping software is no-frills and works vey well. You can store important locations as favorites and also use addresses from your contacts on your PDA.Cons:1) The Black Case can cause unit to overheat in sunny locations when placed on the dashboard.2) Glare from the PDA screen is noticeable in sunny daylight situations. This is a problem eveident in all PDA GPS solutions. It is safer and less distracting to rely on the spoken directions as the GPS will warn you well ahead of any turns. I would recommend using a quality vehicle mount with external speaker and charging built in. The ARKON unit is a good device.3) Low audible output. Again, an external vehicle mount is a good idea when using this in your car.

review/text: Usually I read &quot;general fiction&quot;, but I also like to read &quot;crime novels&quot; from time to time. Of course that good &quot;crime novels&quot; also qualify as literature. Take Graham Greene, for instance, or James Ellroy, the Tinseltown Dostoyevsky. Of course that it's a very tricky business, that of writing crime novels. And unfortunately, Ms. Cornwell's &quot;From Potter's Field&quot; falls a little bellow the mark.Let's take the character development, for instance. Or rather, let us not take it, since there isn't any. Scarpetta continues to be a paranoid b***h who simply cannot stop moralising for a second (I like strong women characters; unfortunately, this one is just irritating). Lucy, whose very existence should be considered a crime, manages to be more annoying than Jar Jar Binks. Gault barely manages to be ONE-dimensional, let alone be terrifying (he's about as scary as Dr.Evil from &quot;Austin Powers&quot;. Minus the jokes.) Marino is his usual amusing cardboard self and everyone else is just walking backdrop.But let us forget character for a while. How about the plot? After all, a good plot can save a crime novel, can't it? Well, not always, but in this case there is no plot. None that Cornwell hasn't written before, that is. Think about it: someone is out on a killing spree, Scarpetta takes on the case, Scarpetta goes here and there and finally, some name is pulled out of the filofax and thrown into the page, only to have him/her shot dead (usually by Scarpetta) at the end. The only difference here is that this time we *know* who the killer is, so the plot becomes quite obvious after the first twenty pages! Not that there weren't enough intriguing possibilities around: say, what has the Army got to do with everything? Or who exactly is Gault's father? (It would be interesting if Cornwell did a &quot;Chinatown&quot; here - you know: the scene where Evelyn (Faye Dunaway) reveals who is the father of her daugther - and came up with some really nasty solution to the question of Gault's parentage. Instead, it appears that Peyton Gault's brother was shagging his wife - duh!) But unfortunately, none of this leads anywhere. The &quot;plot&quot; merely goes on undeterred in its path towards Trite-city, Predictable-land. The only thing that starts out by being vaguely arousing is the scene where Scarpetta meets the Gaults. We aren't usually treated to this kind of viewpoint in the over-simplistic Scarpetta novels, so my hopes were high. What a major disappointment, considering that that scene is handled with all the subtlety of a demolition ball wrecking a building. I know that scenes like that are very difficult to write, but surely Cornwell could have come up with something better? After some time I came to realise that the purpose of that scene was to remind us how much &quot;The Sweet Hereafter&quot; was brilliant in its handling of the reactions of parents towards their wayward - or their lost - children.Also, since we are talking about Scarpetta meets the Gaults, let us pose a question: why, pray tell, is there no explanation concerning Gault's fixation on Scarpetta? And consider the following situation: two twin siblings, very similar genetic traits, very similar upbringing... so why was Jayne Gault such an angel and Temple Gault such a demon? Should we start calling for father Merrin here? (OK, so he snorts about six lines of coke a day, but so did Drew Barrymore before her reinvention and never was she seen indulging in a killing spree.) Also, if it was so obvious from such an early age that Temple Gault had some serious problems, why didn't his parents commit him to an institution? Did they hope that he would grow out of it? In a word, Conrwell's tidbits concerning Gault are pure and simply bizarre. It's so ironic that I re-read the brilliant &quot;The Talented Mr. Ripley&quot; by Patricia Highsmith before I picked up &quot;From Potter's Field&quot; - what a glaring contrast. Gault the classical Anti-christ? Compared to the wonderfully textured Tom Ripley he is just a complete ninny.There were some other things that left some bitter aftertaste in my mouth, such as the ever-present pro-death penalty stance (alright, Patricia, we know what your opinion is... enough already, OK?) and characters being fans of Ayn Rand's books (eek!!!). But considering the former, doesn't Cornwell know that the US is the only industrialised Western country to still have the death penalty? (Here in Portugal we got rid of that *in the late 1800s*.) Doesn't she realise that her arguments either mean absolutely nothing to the other countries where this is being sold or simply irritate lots of people there (myself included)? Also, why does Cornwell insist in portraying Scarpetta &amp; mates as defenders of a featureless society against criminals that are portrayed as &quot;complete outsiders&quot;? Is she afraid to face the real texture of a corrupt society, such as in &quot;Seven&quot;, for instance, and deal with the underlying problems? Since crime has been a feature of almost all human societies from the dawn of time, how about devoting some pages to that issue, instead of brushing it under the carpet?But I see this is getting too long, and I believe that I have stated the reasons to why &quot;From Potter's Field&quot; was a complete waste of time and money. If you want to read an interesting crime novel - a *real* novel - from the female perspective, read &quot;Smilla's Sense of Snow&quot;. If you insist in reading &quot;From Potter's Field&quot; go ahead, but don't say you haven't been warned. As for me, this was not the first Cornwell novel I read, but it will certainly be the last.

review/text: I'll admit that I wasn't really sure what to expect from this movie. It sat on the shelf for three years before Lionsgate decided to finally release it -- straight to DVD. I'm somewhat of a fan of crappy slasher horror movies, mostly of the Evil Dead II variety, and I hoped that Simon Says might be able to give me something new to chew on between viewings of the Sam Raimi classic. It does -- sort of.Simon Says contains virtually every cliche of '80s slasher horror movies. In fact, this film is something of a tribute to those over-to-the-top gore fests. This time, a group of five stereotypical college students (the slut, the straight-laced Asian, the jock, the stoner, and the girl the serial killer is obsessed with) go out into the secluded mountains for a summer camp adventure. Of course, we all know that this leads to drinking, drugs, and a ridiculous amount of sex.Once the movie gets past 30 minutes of boring (and pretty much unneeded) exposition, the serial killer, Simon, makes his move. After attacking one of the college students, he takes out another group of nameless campers who have absolutely no connection to the plot. While this scene is utterly random, it is the best one in the film. Simon kills off a collection of people in highly creative, and highly gruesome, ways (pick-axe, anyone?) that'll make you cringe and laugh at the same time. The gore and the blood are done in such a ridiculous style that you have to laugh at the simple fact that it could never happen.One by one Simon kills off the college students until he is left with his "dream girl." Once virtually all of the characters have been killed off, the movie gets a little flat. The writers attempt to throw in a twist at the end, build the intensity, and make the viewers actually care about the campers. Honestly, by this point I just wanted to see more crazy violence; instead it felt like the writers were trying too hard to make the movie into something that it isn't.Crispin Glover, by far, steals the show as Simon. While his Southern accent is hardly believable, his performance is spot-on and laughably bone-chilling. This is honestly the best performance I have ever seen from him. He pulls off the creepy, disturbed serial killer well and makes viewers wish that there was more of him and his crazy killing antics than the attempt at a plot.This movie has both things that have come to define the slasher horror genre: blood and gore... and boobs, but with a surprising lack of the latter. Yet it also has no intensity, no surprises, horribly corny dialogue, and barely a shred of originality (completely committed to the violence).Simon Says is a polarizing movie. Fans of '80s slasher horror movies and of absurd gore-fest movies will think that it's perfect for taking up a Friday night when you have nothing else to do -- just grab some friends who like these kinds of movies, some alcohol, and a bag of popcorn and you're good to go. However, if you are not a fan of slasher movies or are expecting a horror movie that's actually scary, Simon Says will be an hour and a half of pure pain.

review/text: I have come to appreciate the style of Griffiths over the past few years. I first had his E&amp;M text as an undergraduate and I was grateful for it's simplicity. I now use the Griffiths E&amp;M text to augment my graduate E&amp;M text by Jackson. This is why Griffiths is a good author. He introduces the subject in a clear and concise manner for the purpose of giving the student a solid background.I used Griffith's introductory quantum text when I first came to graduate school. I had not yet taken quantum and so I enrolled in the undergraduate course to give myself sufficient background. Now I am taking a graduate course using Merzbacher's text, which is also a good text, and Griffith's text is the perfect companion.The truth is that no textbook in quantum is completely sufficient for providing a solid background on the subject. The field is relatively new in the realm of physics and I seriously doubt that there are many people on the planet who can say (without their perception clouded by dellusion or arrogance) that they have totally grasped all concepts in the field of quantum physics. One must evolve into a better physicist, and in understanding this very fundamental principle, one can understand that one must start small and eventually progress to bigger things. Griffiths has written a text for those who are taking small or medium sized steps who eventually hope to grasp the concepts introduced in more advanced texts.

As English is my native tongue, and I had studied French/Japanese at school, I was looking for an easy book that would teach me the hindi alphabet and provide me with some easily referenceable vocabulary. Whilst this book provides some assistance on both, I didn't find the layout to be very useful. I would have also preferred more attention on how to write the characters.I'd still recommend this book, but a little more visual assistance (the book is a bit dry, as it is predominantly textual) would have enhanced my learning speed, as well as more romanization of hindi words, especially for beginners such as myself.

review/text: Overall, I would say &quot;A Philadelphia Catholic in King James's Court&quot; was a good read with a few minor flaws. The story centers around a catholic boy named Michael who goes to Kentucky for the summer because his father died. Their he is faced with the pressure of the Fundamentalist Christians trying to convert him to their religion. First of all, Michael is faced defending his Catholic roots many time. One of the problems I found with this is that it seems a little far fetched that he would be able to come up with some of the arguments he has in the short time he is given. On a good note though, his arguments gave me further insight into the Catholic religion, enlightening me on many aspects of it that I never knew before. Next, I found that it was a little too unrealistic that his prophetic dreams actually would come true. After that, I would also say that I think that the book makes the Fundamentalists look to much like bad guys, and it seems that often they go a little too far in an attempt to convert Michael. Even Michael's own Uncle is constantly pressuring him. I felt as if he should just let him be, especially since he just lost his father. Lastly, an aspect that I really enjoyed was the effect that Michael's defending of his religion had on some of the Fundamentalists. In conclusion I really enjoyed &quot;A Philadelphia Catholic in King James's Court&quot; and found myself coming back again and again to see how Michael would defend his religion, being that I am a Catholic to. If you are looking for a book that successfully and accurately delves deep into the Catholic faith, then you will be sorry if you pass up this wonderful story.

review/text: Eric Arthur Blair, under the pen name of George Orwell, wrote 1984 because of his concern of the spread of communism. It is a dark, gothic look at what society could become if the spectre of communism led to totalitarianism. Essentially, it is a more graphic and adult version of his Animal Farm, with people. It is told by a nameless narrator who knows all the goings-on in the world of the future, and follows the life of a middle-aged citizen of Oceania, Winston Smith, who is an employee in the Ministry of Truth. 1984 is not plot-driven, nor is it based on character development (these aspects are still present, however). The primary focus of the book is the setting. We are given the world as it could have become in 1984. Of course, we are not in a situation like that, but the threat of such a situation is still present. This differentiates it from other books, although there is never a reason to dislike or fear something new before trying it. Orwell believed it to be the most effective way to explain the world of 1984, and I think it is effective. If the focus were on the characters or the plot, a high proportion of the messages would have to be interpreted, rather than explained in detail. Different interpretations could mean that certain events make no sense, and discussion would be difficult. Some people may have missed some meanings altogether. By explaining his 'apocalyptic' vision of the future in complete detail, Orwell is able to get the entirety of his message to his readers. Orwell is a very articulate and imaginative writer. The world he depicts is divided into three world powers - Oceania, Eastasia and Eurasia. The Party controls Oceania, the setting of the novel. Big Brother (a parallel to Napoleon from Animal Farm, or Stalin in real life) is at the apex of the social pyramid. He is the father-figure worshipped by the citizens. The Inner Party comprises 2% of the population, and the Outer Party 15%. The remainder consists of the dumb masses, or 'proles'. Any sign of unorthodoxy is dealt with swiftly and harshly by the Thought Police (a parallel to the dogs, the American secret service or Russian KGB). The telescreens that are planted in the walls receive and transmit information simultaneously. The Thought Police use these to keep their citizens under surveillance. Children are turned against their own parents through the use of spy camps and worship of Big Brother. 1984 is partially a look at how easily children can be manipulated and what happens when it goes wrong. Ironically, the people with the least intelligence are given the highest degree of freedom. They do not pose a threat. The chances of an uprising are non-existent because the proles believe anything they are told, and do not take material facts into consideration. Three of the Party's main slogans: 'War is Peace', 'Freedom is Slavery' and 'Ignorance is Strength' are swallowed without question by the majority of the population. The reasons for this, and how the Party pulls it off, are explained in detail later on. The Party was meticulous in its planning. Any totalitarian system requires a scapegoat. In Oceania, it is Emmanuel Goldstein (John Lenin), the subject of the Two Minutes Hate. The Brotherhood is the rebel group that follows Goldstein's teachings, and undermines the Party at any opportunity. The narrator shows us the thoughts that run through Winston's mind, and how he longs for freedom of thought. He meets the book's loveinterest, Julia, whom he disgusts at first glance and lusts after, due to his own failed marriage and her beauty. She wears a chastity scarf, symbolising her (supposed) contempt for sex, part of the reason for his lust - he believes he can never have her. The message here is the desire for that which is forbidden. He later learns that Julia is a rebel, but in a different way, &quot;only from the waist down&quot;, according to Winston. They find a secret hiding place without a telescreen, and are invited to join the Brotherhood by O'Brien. As it turns out, this is when their troubles truly begin. Orwell describes in detail how the Party came into power, its motives and its true objectives. The full implication and repercussions of these revelations are unfurled in the final riveting part of the novel. However, there are flaws in the exploration of the society. We are not given a sufficient view into the eyes of the older generation that lived through the Revolution. Winston only questions one old prole in a pub, and appeared to give up his inquiry too early. 1984 is a very mature book, and I would only recommend it to people who can grasp similar concepts. If the reader is too young, they may dismiss the book as boring. It may seem so at first, but the novel will make more sense with some thought and, possibly, subsequent readings. If you enjoyed Brave New World, you will enjoy 1984, and even if you didn't, you may still like it. This is a philosopher's book.

Problem is, the quotes, and many of his anecdotes, just don't have anything to do with what he was talking about.

review/text: Written in an amateurish, stream of consciousness style, RANSOM reads like an author's first attempt at a novel. The omniscient point of view, deployed arbitrarily, prohibits any sort of conflict or sense of immediacy. Pages and pages of inane dialogue also fail to create intrigue, plot development or chemistry between two-dimensional characters. And we've met these nice, uninteresting people before (although Ms. Garwood &quot;tells not shows&quot; how arrogant, stubborn, brave, gorgeous etc. they all are.) Scores of needless, faceless characters are given names, a smokescreen for the lack of plot.The series of non-events, which fill three-fourths of this overlong book, creep toward a unsatisfying climax, though by the end the reader has forgotten where the story was heading and ceases to care.Try an active voice, Ms. Garwood. Give the heroine something to do besides be pretty, stubborn, and handle flesh wounds well. And more descriptions of settings and descriptions sprinkled throughout might have helped; often the voices spoke from a void.Nothing is more wonderful than a historical romance where the hero and heroine conquer insurmountable odds to be together in love and a happy ending.Unfortunately in RANSOM, neither the characters nor story was up to it.

review/text: I purchased CA's antivirus software because I had read some good reviews. After purchasing I downloaded the most current version. I installed it on one of three PCs in the house. All reasonably new and powerful Dells: 2 running McAfee and 1 running Norton. The first PC is XP Pro. The installation went smoothly, with only one "program must terminate" error that did not seem to affect the installation. I noted that the program was smaller in disk space and in memory footprint. I tested this for a week with only one occurrence of needing to reboot due to some obscure failure (red X over the icon in my system tray).I decided it was good to use and purchased two more licenses to install on the two XP Home machines in the house. This did not go well. Now, I have two machines that are requiring me to completely reinstall Windows. After removing both McAfee and Norton from these two respective PCs, they booted up fine. Then I installed CA eTrust Antivirus version 7.0.6.7 and the problems started. The PCs both would boot to the Welcome screen and then freeze. About 20% of the time when booting in Safe Mode they would finally get all the way to the desktop (after 30 minutes of chunking) only to get a message "Windows must now restart because the remote procedure call (RPC) service terminated unexpectedly". Then a 50 second timer starts and Windows and the PC reboots. The taskbar is unresponsive while Windows is up and the CPU is pegged. For this 50 seconds there is no way to interrupt the automatic shutdown. Basically, the installation of this software made the PC behave as if it was infected by a very bad computer virus.I spent 45 minutes chatting over the Internet with friendly Sameet. The final outcome of that painful communication was that Sameet types something like: "I must inform you that I am not authorized to work on this problem because it is your problem and I am not authorized."So, now I am reinstalling Windows XP Home on two machines and returning CA eTrust EZ Antivirus for a full refund. Looks like I will be sticking with Norton from now on. I think CA is rushing this product to market without doing enough testing. Don't buy it unless you like reinstalling Windows.

review/text: Rob Walker's LETTERS FROM NEW ORLEANS is part travelogue, part memoir with a little social commentary thrown in for good measure. According to the introduction, this book grew out of actual letters he began writing to friends after he and a girl friend identified only as "E" moved to New Orleans in early 2000. Four years later the couple left the city "for reasons that remain unclear." Since they at first were not meant for publication, perhaps that is why these meandering letters are so wondrously conversational and totally unself-conscious. To a letter, they are a delight to read and made me want to revisit this most European of U. S. cities.Mr. Walker covers some of the subjects usuallly associated with New Orleans: Mardi Gras, jazz funerals, fine dining, the French Quarter and the relentless humidity. Although he obviously loves this city, he does not shy away from writing about the blight of public housing, urban decay and the fragile balance of race relations. The book is chock-full of both memorable characters and places. Whether they got that way on their own or were made that way by Mr. Walker's pen, it really doesn't matter. We meet Ernie K-Doe, the R & B singer who gave us the hit "Mother-in-Law," whose funeral Walker writes about. And Galatorie's, the restaurant that fired a popular waiter-- who apparently couldn't keep his hands off women diners-- and so incensed its clientele that the article covering the firing in THE TIMES-PICAYUNE generated more reader comments than any subject since September 11. Don't forget the part-time embalmer at the funeral home Over by Rhodes and fulltime cashier at the grocery store Save-A Center. Or the notorious Gennifer Flowers. I feel better knowing she wound up in a club in the French Quarter where she now occasionally holds court, sings a little and will be photographed with you for $6.00. It seems appropriate that her now club once was a bar with what the writer describes as a "high-end whorehouse" upstairs.The author is nothing is not thorough. In one of the longest chapters in his book, he tells us everything we ever wanted to know-- and then some-- about the song "St. James Infirmary." Although I had never heard of the song before, I'm going to find the Harry Connick version and see what the fuss is all about. Mr. Walker is that good at making his case for this music.One of the most intriguing things about the LETTERS is that Mr. Walker never tells the name of the woman who is living with him although he mentions her constantly. She is simply "E." Elvira, Emily, Evangeline? We do not have a clue as to what the "E" stands for. Since he tells us that she left a good job in New York City to move to New Orleans with him, we are probably safe in assuming that he is not guilty of transporting a minor across state lines. On the other hand, perhaps, as Garrison Keillor would say, E thought she could do better and insisted on remaining anonymous.Finally, although there are many interesting photographs scattered throughout the book, we never see a picture of the author. Most readers want to see what a writer they like looks like-- and like Mr. Walker you will. LETTERS FROM NEW ORLEANS is a fascinating, informative read.

Amazingly, it speaks just as powerfully to me, a 30-year veteran of "human potential" and "spiritual growth" books and workshops who thought she'd read it all, as it would to a neophyte. If you do the simple exercises at the end of each chapter, your life is almost guaranteed to change for the better. But even readers who don't do the homework will find the book uplifting and rewarding. It's easy to read yet profound at the same time.As a woman in a major life transition, I find this book a wonderful companion on my journey of personal growth and change, as it confirms and validates my own intuition and sense of the Truth. One term that especially resonated with me but with which I was previously unfamiliar is "non-alignment fatigue," describing that drain of energy that comes when one is with companions whose emotions are different from our own. Caroline makes it OK to trust our intuition and offers exercises to fine-tune our ability to listen to it. I highly recommend this book!

review/text: If you've seen stray dogs in your city and wondered how they live, how they became homeless, and what finally happens to them, this book will tell you. This is the story of dogs on the street and one man who has dedicated his life to saving them.Randy Grim works every day with homeless dogs in the St. Louis metro area. These are dogs that were once pets, now abandoned by their owners. Or, they were born on the streets and have never known a safe and loving home. By the time Randy finds them in abandoned city warehouses and on busy streets, they have little faith in humans. It is his seemingly impossible job to convince them to trust again. He acclimates them to human behavior so that they can be adopted by responsible families. Randy's non-profit organization, Stray Rescue of St. Louis, is dedicated to saving the lives of dogs on the street.This is a story of heartbreak and hope. It is the story of dogs who were brutalized and who come to trust again. When we see how Randy's patient work can turn around even the most distrustful dog, we can celebrate that special bond that exists between man and animal. It will make many animal lovers sad because it details struggles of dogs on the street. But it will also serve as inspiration to show the rest of us what can be done!

review/text: This video is a documentary of The Animals and Eric Burdon's bands after the Animals broke up, up to and including War.There are quite a few interesting interviews and commentary but all the music contained herein is all just short clips.At least they mostly interview people relevant to the story, mostly Eric Burdon in a really laid back way. There are also interview clips with Chas Chandler, Alan Price, etc., but the appearances of Sammy Hagar is awkward & out of place. I guess since he says he saw them at Monterey it has some relevance.Very interesting stories about the Animals days, especially touring England on one bus with Jerry Lee Lewis and Chuck Berry, who apparently were not very compatible touring partners, to put it nicely. That story is a hoot. Also who knew that "House Of The Rising Sun" was done in one take, and their management (Michael Jeffries of Jimi Hendrix fame)and producer Mickey Most resisted even doing it. The story about Eric meeting Nina Simone was also very interesting. Interesting views about Jimi Hendrix, too, of whom Eric was supposedly a good friend of.You could tell that early R&R; management, producers, touring, etc. took its toll on musicians, even when they were strong and young. The Animals just got screwed from the get-go. No wonder why they didn't last.All in all, a good documentary for Animals, Eric Burdon (and the Animals), and War fans. My main gripes are a lack of identification of people being interviewed (at least do it on their first appearance), and music clips that only last a minute or two. Come on documentary makers, many of us want to see the ENTIRE song, not just a short clip. At least make it a menu item to watch the entire performances separately, if possible. Warning - if you must have a performance clip of the song "Sky Pilot", it does NOT appear here.Sound quality varies (stereo and mono) but is acceptable considering the sources.

review/text: This film is the continuation of Jean De Florette and deals with the grown daughter's(Emmanuelle Beart) revenge on the unsuspecting farmers who deceived her father. This continuation develops the original plot further. The deceitful farmers played by Yves Montand and Daniel Auteuil soon realize that they've deceived themselves as much as the innocent Jean de Florette. The theme is a complex study of human nature and is somewhat akin to Caine's dilemma, 'Am I not my brother's keeper?'The cinematography and script are excellent but I was rather disappointed in Emmanuelle Beart's performance. She's the weakest actor in this film and, because she's unfortunately also the central character, her inept skills have a significant impact on the film altogether. Her acting is forced and the emotions she attempts to express don't leave a very strong impression. Other than that, the story is great with an impeccable supporting cast.

review/text: Okay, I have only printed 10 pages so far, so the stars are based on those great prints, the 5th star taken away because I am a MAC user! Here is my experience and I HOPE it helps all of you other Mac OSX users out there! I spoke with an HP rep for over an hour at a retail store, he sold me on this VERY affordable laser to replace my ink sucker Epson, all was great until he finds out I am a Mac user. As you all know, this is a problem. After some thought and reading the 58 reviews before me and other websites, I decide to take the plunge. I try to install it using the 'cheat' HP 1022 method to absolutely no avail! Now, exteremly frustrated, trying every 'trick' in the book, I google this problem. I stumble into the [...] and there is a review from "fpc". I was a little leary but this is my last hope. It tells me how to do this once and for all. Not thinking it would actually work, I download his provided link (which apparently is the 'original' link before HP pulled it and reloaded a non-working one for Mac). And IT WORKED!!!! I followed his instructions which took 3 minutes and I am printing perfectly... I ALMOST sucked up the 15% store restocking fee, but thanks to "fpc" I can print again!!!! SO for all of you who want this printer and not the headache, visit fpc's review and follow his instructions! GOOD LUCK! And to HP (and that friendly rep, you know who you are).... WHY? Why make us have to do all of this? Seems rediculous doesn't it??????????

review/text: The greatest achievement in western literature is now available in a bound version heretofore reserved for second rate "How to" books from the remainder bin. This publisher offers no preface, foreword, notes, or so much as an illustrator's credit for the apt cover; the sole redeeming feature of this tawdry effort. Usually clocking in at 740 pages plus, this version manages to squeeze every word of the masterwork into a nimble 554 pages, thanks to a total lack of margin space or chapter breaks. Laughably, the book's spine does not allow even for this squeezed assembly, so that it arrives splayed and bow-legged, in unintentional tribute to the willowy author perhaps. Under-inked to the point of appearing mimeographed, with serifs giving way on almost every page, this is hardly the version one needs of a book to be cherished and re-visited often.

review/text: Overall I'd give this product something like 3 1/2 stars, as the device itself is ok, but the way it works with the iPAQ is problematic. The hardware itself is pretty straightforward, although you can charge only either the device or your iPAQ at once, not both at the same time with the car adapter (you can use the iPAQ AC charger to charge the device at home, however). More problematic is the iPAQ itself (in my case, the 5450), which is simply unreadable in the car due to glare--I had to take it out of the holster constantly to read it. The sound at full volume is also barely audible, I had to turn off the AC and radio to hear it; I would check the volume and readability of your PocketPC device in your car before considering this solution. The navigation software is competent, although it is somewhat erratic regarding turns; sometimes it tells you to turn a block before, other times right at the corner. The software will lock up on you (necessitating a reboot) if you don't exit the program before turning your PocketPC off--you can't just turn it off when you reach your destination. The GPS unsurprisingly conks out in tunnels, and can take several minutes to find itself again. It has a tendency to slide around on your dash unless you find a flat spot. The good things about this device? The price--one of the cheaper GPS solutions you can get if you have a PocketPC; portability, you can upgrade your PocketPC device and still use this solution; you can use it with Microsoft Streets (with a bluetooth connection) on a laptop. It's probably best used however with a passenger reading the iPAQ for you.

This was a fast read (I did it in 3 days, along with working 8 hours each day and studying) and I was wrapt until the middle of the book, when I realized exactly what was going to happen. I finished the book, with hopes that I was incorrect. I was disappointed with the transparent climax, but overall this is worthwhile, especially if you haven't read any of Plain's greater works or can forget that you have.

They are stylish, waterproof, well crafted and a brilliant fit for a broad foot. This is a boot you can walk in all day and not have sore feet; I have never had one blister and they require no breaking in. In recent times I have been unable to source this brand in Western Australia, and when I finally found a store that carried them they were twice the price offered by Amazon. And thanks to Amazons sizing chart the mens size 9 translated perfectly. I have yet to be disappointed by Hi Tec which is why I have found it unnecessary to try other brands. The Altitude rates as the best to date. I cannot recommend this boot highly enough.

review/text: Representing Reality theorizes documentary in all-round perspectives. Among others, I think this book is important especially in that it raises the question of reality per se. Documentary has always been marginal not only in discourse but also in cinema industry, under the poor understanding of reality. I think Nichols's notion of &quot;reflexivity&quot; is a key concept itself in understanding documentary, which also provides a good alternative reading regarding what is documentary or not. I think this book will give you a great deal of food for thought, when you have ever contemplated what is real and when we become to question about what we are seeing, not only in films but also in real life.

review/text: Walker James has the assignment to infiltrate a Middle Eastern Terrorist organization called the Brothers of Darkness so that he may locate and destroy an anthrax lab before a deadly plot decimates the majority of the country's population. Walker's delinquent childhood and experience as a thief hold him in good stead as he walks the shadowy world of espionage. Indeed, Walker fits well into a world without the clarity of black and white, preferring to walk the ambiguous gray areas. He's earned the nickname The Ghost for his ability to slip in and out of seemingly impenetrable places. While he works well alone or as a part of a team, he's not prepared for his new partner. Jasmine LeBarr outmaneuvered him three years ago, and he's never forgiven her.Jasmine goes undercover as an emissary called Rose Mahrain with Walker accompanying her as her driver. She has a gift for gaining people's trust, and of getting them to underestimate her, which she uses to her advantage. While Walker calls her an opportunist who will go any length to get what she wants, Jasmine actually adheres carefully to her own moral code. Walker is dangerous to her well being as any man she's ever brought down. He's already hurt her once with his callous dismissal, and she refuses to be that vulnerable again. Indeed, their lingering attraction may prove to be the most dangerous aspect of the mission.Kylie Brant weaves an intriguing web of danger in this timely tale of terrorism and romance in BORN IN SECRET. Unfortunately, while the theme of first-born sons frames the narrative, it does not affect the plot as a whole, resulting in a tacked on feeling at the end. Nevertheless, BORN IN SECRET is a highly believable, vividly realized tale. The fast paced plot and the strong characterizations are nicely balanced, resulting in a tale at once deadly, yet richly balanced by powerful emotions and physical attraction. Jasmine is a vivacious and strong heroine who refuses to allow Walker's scathing comments regarding their shared history get to her. In addition, she knows exactly how to apply her feminine wiles to great advantage to the men she encounters. Further, Walker's James Bond-like charisma and looks, complete with cool spy toys, makes him a memorable hero. Highly recommended.

review/text: This is definately on of the scariest movies ever made! 4.5 out 5 stars! It's a little slow in the middle. This film isn't for everybody though, this one gives you authentic scares! This isn't for everyone. You have to use your imagination and put yourself in the characters shoes. Works in every movie. But if you are one of those who just don't care about story, or just to lazy to think, and just want thrills, Then rent Halloween, Nightmare on Elm Street, Friday the 13th, or The Texas Chainsaw Massacre.This has the perfect ending! This isn't as scary as The Omen or The Exorcist, but it's right up there with them! Definately worth checking out!

review/text: Having suffered the derision of fellow sci-fi fans for many years, I recently picked up the Foundation Trilogy for the first time; I was actually pretty disappointed by my first exposure to Asimov's longer works. Obviously the man is one of the renowned masters of science fiction because he got there first: he wrote about a Galactic Empire long before it became cliche, speculated about the limits and triumphs of science, etc. That said, what struck me most about this beginning to the Foundation series was that Asimov's story exactly parallels Hari Seldon's theory of psychohistory: only movements, not individuals, are significant in shaping history, and even the main characters in the book are accordingly underdeveloped to the point of being forgettable. I enjoy world-building as much as the next sci-fi/fantasy buff, but I also appreciate well-constructed sentences and good characterization, both of which I found sorely lacking here. Also, &quot;Foundation&quot; is clearly a man's world, setting a tradition of male adolescent sci-fi in which strong and/or interesting female characters have no place.I give the novel three stars only because it sets up the background for the next two in the series, which overcome some (but not all) of the faults in this first effort. But I think that I will return to my personal favorites among the old masters, including Robert Heinlein and Theodore Sturgeon, who have always delivered philosophy, wit, and imagination along with excellent storytelling.

I found that Catholicism and Protestantism are very closely related. We do have some political and some idealogical differences. However, we are united in Christ which does make us brothers and sisters in faith. This book is great if your a Protestant and are just curious about the Catholic faith. It really helped me become more firmly rooted in Catholicism. Thanks, Alan Schreck!

review/text: I'm still not to sure what possessed me to read this. Sure a bunch of people I knew said it was great. Now I'm seriously questioning their sanity. For some reason I kept reading, as I hoped it would get better. 600+ pages later, I've realized that I'm never going to get that time back. The author manages to reduce the Tudor Era into a cheesy soap opera. Seriously, one could have just replaced the names with modern day ones, and set the story in some inner city, and made it about drug dealers and prostitutes, and it would have more or less read the same.First off, the main character. Besides Bella in Twilight, I'd find it difficult to find a more bland and boring main character. Her sum goal in life seems to be, I want to marry for love! and have lots of bouncing babies! The author glorifies this, by contrasting her to her nymphomaniac of a sister, Anne, who's depicted as cruel and comes off as an insane harpy. Now, the author considers her self a feminist, yet she portrays the active woman as a monster, and the "good" woman, as passive and bland. Oh, and if its not subtle enough, Anne has dark hair, and dark features, while the good sister, has blond hair and pale features. Coincidence? I think not.Now, on to the history of this book. For some reason the author decided that all allegations made against Anne were true. This is the historical equivalent of saying that all the allegations made during the communist show trials of the 50's were true. The author takes this to the extreme, and in her book, Anne sleeps with her own brother in an attempt to get pregnant. At the end, the whole thing just comes off as offensive.The writing is pretty bad also. The heavy use of foreshadowing doesn't help the situation. I'm pretty sure people already know what happened to Anne, so they aren't going to be saying when they reach the end of the book "Darn...I should have seen that coming!"In short, save your money, save your time and read some good historical fiction. Like Susanne Alleyn's A Game of Patience, or The Caviler of the Apocalypse.

review/text: This is frightening. Not just because of the volume, the grindingly slow pace, the subsonic frequencies, the sense of revelation through abjection, or even Alan Dubin's tortured vocals. No, what's really frightening is just how MUSICAL Khanate are.They're often described as an evolution from Stephen O'Malley's earlier band Burning Witch: whereas BW was more obviously doom metal (although their two tracks on the Goatsnake/Burning Witch split album pushed the envelope pretty far, and sound more like the later band), Khanate goes way beyond the genre. Think of Swans, or Melvins' more experimental stuff. Most of all, think of Scorn, whose bass player James Plotkin provides the foundation for Khanate's rotting edifices of sound.And there is something architectural about Khanate, a sense of coherent structure that you don't get with most doom metal. Far from just cranking out 16rpm Sabbath riffs, Khanate create a sense of space and atmosphere I haven't heard since Scorn's 'Vae Solis' (THE prototype ambient metal record). Don't get me wrong, there are spine-rattling riffs here. But there's also beautifully teased feedback, near-impressionistic percussion (via Tim Wyskida's 'hammers'), and some surprisingly clean guitar sounds. And how they manage to play in time at this speed is beyond me. It's almost telepathic.Then there's Dubin. Personally I preferred Edgy59's vocals in Burning Witch: he could sound like a murderous psychopath one second and a frightened infant the next, and even convince you there wasn't much difference. Dubin is more aggressive and more self-assured. Superficially the two bands are similar, but where Burning Witch sounded lost and confused, Khanate sound like they've come through that to the other side -- they have suffered into truth.If you like anything else O'Malley has been involved in, any of the bands I've mentioned so far, or Earth, Thrones etc. you will love this. Just don't listen to it on acid.

review/text: This movie is in black and white (better still, in black and red!) and I don't mean colorwise. It's your standard politically-correct hagiography where good guys ooze beatitude, bad guys reek evil, and if you don't root for the former, you belong with the latter. Like history told this way? If so, then you're gonna love it; if not, at least you'll get some laughs.Mind you, it's not that I object the fake look, dubbed dialogue, hammy overacting or holier-than-thou attitude of everyone concerned in this dated political flick from the sixties; I mean, we were all pretty much ridiculous ourselves back then. But Joan Baez's awful lyrics and worst wailing tear apart the movie's only redeeming asset: Ennio Morricone's beautiful music score. Now that's a true crime!So you've been warned!

review/text: I recently saw this on my bookshelf and decided to read it again after a hiatus of many years. Well, time has not diminished the power of this book to engage the reader. Humorous and thought provoking, it allows the reader a glimpse into the mind of Bettina Balser, an upper middle class woman, living in Manhattan somewhere in the late nineteen sixties, who feels that she is losing her mind. Consequently, she begins to keep a diary, because she finds it cathartic. Through her diary, the reader sees a dawning awareness of self, a self that she has long repressed.Bettina married her husband Jonathan, when he was an idealistic up and coming Assistant District Attorney. When his political aspirations did not bear fruit, he left public service and became an insufferable, materialistic, social climbing corporate attorney. He is also a total control freak, planning every aspect of their lives and disparaging his wife at every opportunity. The sad thing is that he is totally unaware of what he is doing to his wife, so self-absorbed is he. They have two equally insufferable little girls, who seem to emulate their father at every turn. It is no wonder that Bettina feels that she is sinking into an abyss. It is as if she were a displaced person with no place to go, no place to run, no place to hide. Where has her self gone?The author takes the reader into the inner workings of Bettina's mind. The reader sees how she copes with her struggle to find the woman within the shell she has become. In its time, this book was viewed as being feminist in nature. What else would one call it, when the book is clearly about a woman's struggle with the hand that fate has dealt her simply by virtue of her gender? Although some of the references seem a little dated, such as the cost of certain things or the fact that everyone seemed to smoke cigarettes, it is simply reflective of its time and quite fitting. Full of humor, wit, and discreet social commentary, this is a book that has become a modern day classic.

review/text: I found this book VERY difficult to follow. It contained many typographical errors, misspellings, and inappropriate word choices and phraseology. The content was poorly organized. I had expected a cogent articulation of the situation, the facts, conclusions, and recommendations for further reseach or review. This book contained none of these. I struggled through at least one-half of the book and then gave up. I scanned the rest of the book and decided it was not worth my time. If I could return it for a refund I would do so. Having said all of this, the readers of this review need to know I am not a casual reader of books about the topic. Over the years I have read over 20 to 25 books about the assassination of JFK. I was hoping to learn something more, new, or different. I was disappointed because the author probably had something very worthwhile to say but his message was lost in his very poor presentation. My recommendation would be for him to give whatever information he collected to someone else to write.

review/text: ** Major plot points revealed ahead **Having thoroughly enjoyed _The Mayor of Casterbridge_ and _Jude the Obscure_, both of which featured strong central characters and real pathos, I was somewhat disappointed with _Tess of the D'Urbervilles_. The novel starts promisingly enough: early on, Tess Durbeyfield's family learns that it is descended from the noble and ancient D'Urberville clan. Tess's father is so elated at this news that he drinks himself into a stupor, requiring Tess to perform his delivery route early the next morning. Unused to the work, she gets into an accident, killing the family's only horse, and is sent to a nearby D'Urberville homestead--which the family thinks belongs to a rich relation--to beg a replacement.Alec D'Urberville, the owner of the mansion, is a wealthy bourgeois who purchased the D'Urberville surname. He hires "cousin" Tess as a farmhand and attempts to seduce her. Eventually, she gives in (some reviewers wrote that she was raped; Hardy never spells out the nature of their sexual relationship, but various clues led me to believe it was consensual). Tess becomes disgusted with this way of life and returns to her parents, soon realizing that she's pregnant. The child dies soon after birth, however, and Tess leaves home once again to find employment.She meets and marries Angel Clare, with whom she believes she is mutually madly in love, but to whom she cannot bring herself to reveal her past relationship. Finally she does so, at the worst possible time--their wedding night--and Angel, being one hell of a hypocrite (he had just "confessed" to her that he once spent two days with a hooker) rejects her. Brokenhearted, Tess goes back to work, falling deeper into poverty while mourning the loss of her husband's love. By sheer coincidence, she runs into Alec D'Urberville again, who expresses real remorse when he learns that she had had a child by him and had been disgraced, and offers to marry her and legitimize their relationship. Although Tess dislikes Alec and holds out as long as she can, hoping for Angel to return to her, she finally accepts Alec's offers of assistance and security and elopes with him--right before Angel arrives to reconcile with her. Upon seeing her husband for the first time in years, Tess spurns him, then runs upstairs and stabs Alec to death. At the end of the novel she reconciles with Angel, then is executed for Alec's murder.If the latter half of the plot sounds a little silly, it is. Tess is not a wrongdoer or a "bad woman," but she is utterly spineless, submissive, and slavishly devoted to her husband--himself a weak hypocrite who abandons his now "impure" wife. If you're looking for a Victorian novel with a protofeminist heroine who defies public opinion and really belives women's role in society ought to be improved (as in the works of Burney, Wharton, or even James), you won't find it here. The real tragedy of _Tess_ is that she victimizes and punishes herself as much as the society that condemns her. Oddly, the most sympathetic character in the novel is the villain, Alec, who, having destroyed Tess's virtue, feels genuine remorse and tries, in good faith, to make it up to her. Tess is a creature of such gutlessness--time and time again, she finds herself unable to assertively communicate with those around her even when it's imperative that she do so--that it's impossible to imagine her stabbing this fellow; one of the major faults of this work is the implausibility of the characters' development.As always, Hardy pens lovely descriptions of his famed Wessex as well as of 19th century farm living; as a travelogue, this novel can't be beat. But the story lacks any real conflict: Tess is so despairing and accepting of her fate that we can't hope she'll ever move forward, and she doesn't. The inevitability of _Tess's_ conclusion is its tragedy.

review/text: Jack Polidoro grabs the readers attention from the start. He puts the reader right into the lives of the people who are the players in this book. He begins by telling just enough to whet one's appetite making the reader hungry for more of the story. His eye for detail is amazing, one would have to believe that the author himself is a pilot and has been through a crash landing in open water. Once the serious actions began to take place, I found myself riveted to the book to the degree that I could not put it down until I had completed it. Polidoro manages to come up with an unexpected domino affect as a result of the first tragedy to take place. He has just enough twists and turns in his novel to peak the interest of any reader. Had I not read the nature of the plot, I might have been hesitant to take another flight on a commercial airline. This is one book that has it all, suspense, romance, intrigue, and fast action. I would recommend it as a great read for everyone.

review/text: This meticulous study of the Luftwaffe on the Russian Front during the 1942-1943 debacle doubtless is a major contribution to the genre, but the text is peculiarly dry and remote despite the extraordinary subject matter. Hayward decided to &quot;avoid all unnecessary anecdotes, however fascinating they are&quot; and the resulting narrative, in this reader's opinion, exhibits a curious detachment that is in sharp contrast to the drama of the events he describes.Although it would be absurd to compare this book with, say, a Tom Clancy novel, it also would be fair to say that the text largely fails to capture and reflect the human dimensions of these shattering conflicts. As a substantive work of scholarship it deserves much credit, but it is difficult to know exactly who the intended audience is. I doubt that the general reader of WW II history will read this detailed chronology from cover to cover. The text does not compel that kind of sustained attention.I wonder if all the reviewers who have heaped accolades on this book actually have read it through. It often is easier to recognize virtue than to embrace it...In it's favor, I cheerfully concede that the scholarship appears to be thorough and careful. The abbreviation lists, explanations of German operational units/commands, endnotes and bibliography are quite helpful. I assume that the technical accuracy is beyond reproach. Possibly it is the best and most accessible English-language chronology available to serious scholars of these actions.The problem here seems to be that a meticulous and dispassionate chronology of military engagements, movements of units, and casualty lists, written after the fact by distilling details from primary sources, is not a full history. It is an essential part of the historical record, to be sure, but it is two-dimensional. The total experiences of the Luftwaffe on the Russian Front cannot be so neatly described because the conflict was not neat and tidy. War is a desperate enterprise: quirky, unpredictable, savage, gentle, brave, cowardly, wise, foolish, loving, hateful, and essentially incomprehensible. In short, it subsumes the full, rich tapestry of the human experience.In Hawyard's book we have the melody, but by his choice the harmonies are missing. If one contrasts this text with Bruce Cattons' extraordinary series of Civil War studies, or with Evan Connell's brilliant and evocative biography of George Armstrong Custer in &quot;Son of the Morning Star&quot;, one is struck by the difference between history as art and history as an actuarial record.Reading Hayward's precise, accurate, and aseptic text seems, to me, like watching a skilled neurosurgeon perform a difficult operation: Technically impressive but emotionally absent. The men on both sides who struggled and died here largely have been overlooked, subordinated to the sanitary recounting of operational details. They deserve more.As a different approach to the historiography of this conflict, one might wish to read &quot;Citadel: the Battle of Kursk&quot; by Robin Cross (Sarpedon, c1993).The index is very poor. The large number of undifferentiated page references make it, in part, useless. For example, under &quot;Hitler, Adolf&quot; we find over 60 page numbers or page ranges strung uselessly together. Similarly, under &quot;Richthofen, Wolfram Freiherr von&quot; we find 42 page numbers/page ranges en bloc. Under &quot;Fliegerkorps VIII&quot; 56 page references are clustered together. Undoubtedly this makes for a shorter index. But, as Einstein once remarked, &quot;Everything should be made as simple as possible, but not any simpler.&quot;The Luftwaffe campaign in the East reflects all the intrinsic contradictions, strengths and weakness, brilliant successes, tragic failures, and unparalleled human cost, of this titanic conflict between two profoundly antagonistic world views. If Hayward's text represents the high-water mark of scholarship regarding Luftwaffe actions on the Eastern Front, the fully-fledged, three-dimensional account of this unprecedented carnage remains to be written.

review/text: I have had the Rhomba now for about 8 months and I am very happy with it. There was a problem after about 3 months but after some intense convosations with creative's customer support and online assitance I upgraded the firmware and have had no problems.It can hold enough wma for my needs. It is small enough to go running with (the reason I chose it in the first place). I have a couple of issues with it which would not have stopped me buying it. but may be of concen.Power&#62; power display on the screen bares little relation to the power held in the unit. It never appears to go below about 60% power but has run dry several times. I would (in restrospect) have prefered to have a battery powered as if you don' have a PC around with a USB port, you can be kinda stuck. perhaps someone will come up with a power supply cable which goes straight to a USB conector from an AC source (with whatever voltage they need)radio &#62; when this works it is great.. sadly to get it to work i need to heavily flick the unit a few times. OK not best practace!But as I said do have a small MP3 player which works with WMA and is easy to use I have been very happy with this unit.

I have a canon digital rebel all I have to is pop in the CF card and dump all my pics and keep shooting. This process doesn't even take 5mins, and that's a 512mb card.The video is amazing, it's flawless, I haven't noticed any jerkiness in the playback. The software is pretty slow but I use another freeware program to convert video.Excellent Sound quality, it has a customizable EQ and Bass boost, what else do you expect from a company that makes high end sound cards? The navigation is SOOOOOO easy and fun to use. Battery life is great as well. This has to be the best thing Creative has ever produced.

review/text: Before I begin my review, I would like to say this: art is not a fact, it is a personal opinion. So to all of the Bj&ouml;rk fans, like myself, do not harass people who are not able to appreciate her music. It doesn't mean they're stupid, it doesn't mean they're ignorant, it doesn't mean they don't know art. Everyone has different opinions and they are entitled to share them. With that said, I will move on...I had been anticipating the release of this album for what seems like forever. I watched the podcasts and the little "vlips" on YouTube. I checked her website daily. So when the day finally came, I was unbelievably excited. Upon first listen, I was very disappointed. For an album entitled 'Volta,' I was expecting, you know... voltage, energy. I thought this was going to be 100% upbeat. I got the wrong impression. (Mind you, before hearing the whole album, the only songs I had heard were "Earth Intruders" and "Innocence." I resisted downloading the leaked version.) I'd say the albumn is half up-tempo and the other half is composed of slower songs.I was ready to post a three star review on here, but instead, I chose to give it another listen. The initial shock was now gone, and I was able to appreciate 'Volta' for what it is. I was looking for the raw energy in all the wrong places. I was looking at the surface and thought that just becuase the LP is not all fast-paced, that it lacked in charge. But what I realized the second time around was that the energy is here, in the emotion that Bj&ouml;rk delivers with each note and lyric she sings. Bj&ouml;rk's vocals are better than ever on here, the production is superb, the lyrics are amazing and the brass ensemble adds shockingly beautiful elements to this tribal album. This is arguably Bj&ouml;rk's most well-rounded work to date; it has the fun and mainstream elements of Debut, the experimentation of Post, the raw emotion of Homogenic, the softness of Vespertine and the primitive, tribal elements of Medulla. Wow! I would review song by song, but I'll keep it short.Now, don't get me wrong. There are still one or two dull patches throughout the album and it will take even more getting used to... but when all is said and done, 'Volta' is another excellent, beautiful piece of work to add to Bj&ouml;rk's discography. If you are a fan of hers', this is a must-have. If you are not, I still encourage you to take a chance and try this out. I did so with her last album, Medulla, and I do not regret it. Well done, Bj&ouml;rk!*The limited edition has a thicker case. (It's the same material used for the original digipak, though.) The packaging and contents is a bit different and expanded from the normal edition. The two flaps are held together with a slightly larger sticker, with a gold outline instead of the regular white. It has the CD and a DVD with the album in 5.1 and DTS. The discs are not contained in any plastic tray, but rather in a puzzle of little boxes/sleeves. There are 5 cardboard sleeves. Each one has a photo of Bj&ouml;rk with the flame letters like the ones in the standard edition booklet and the back of the sleeves are all funky, Volta-ish colors. They diminish in size with each one and in the last sleeve are two thin, paper, orange and red sleeves that hold the discs. This edition also has a different booklet. There are no pictures in it, since they're already on the cardboard sleeves, so there's more room for the lyrics. Each song has its own page. Hope that helped. To me, it was definitely worth the purchase and I think any Bj&ouml;rk fan who likes Volta will be satisfied.*

Every song hits a chord with a certain emotion or memory whereby the songs become a conduit for thought and musing. Some songs have a Beatlesuqe feel and others bring Dylan to mind but Kelly's lyrics and his unique voice make the music clearly his own. He can menacing like on &quot;Give In To My Love&quot; or &quot;Before Too Long&quot; and poignant like on &quot;Winter Coat or &quot;To Her Door&quot;.

review/text: I cannot count the number of times I was asked, "What's so special about the year 1984?" while I was reading the book the title of which randomly forsees that particular year. That question scared me, because this novel is so important. Beyond that, I was floored that some people had not at least heard of "1984" (which was first published in 1949). That is not a criticism of those who are guilty of this, but rather an indication of my incredulity, because the impact had on our culture by Orwell's genius, manifested in "1984", cannot be overstated. As another reviewer here noted, it is indeed true that many people reference George Orwell's prescient masterpiece, oftentimes without realizing what it is that influenced their thought or even having actually read the book."1984" animates the collective paranoia that stems from our well-founded wariness of contemporary society's ever-encroaching governmental systems, as well as the potential dangers introduced to them by the evolution of modern technology.Furthermore, it reminds those paying attention that we must guard our psyches and intellects against the mad intentions of those who forget, or disregard, the truth that to conform for conformity's sake alone is to surrender rights to humanity's defining gift.I would suggest that you don't pick "1984" as a casual beach-read. It is riveting, but heavy and thick with relevance to current events. Don't read it after having a few drinks either, especially when you come to the book-within-a-book portion.

So back and forth with numerous, long waits and calls and some very tense arguements. Received a new monitor after about 5 weeks and it was good.

review/text: I remember having read this book in high school. I immediately fell in love with Hardy. (I was also fond of Hardy Boys at that time, so in my opinion the name Hardy acquired a special significance.) Unfortunately, though, I never liked another book by him quite so much. I've read Tess of the d'Urbvilles, Under the Greenwood Tree, Far from the Madding Crowd(which was perhaps his second best novel, as others here have affirmed), and perhaps a few others. It is strange, or perhaps significant that I remember the exact circumstance when I was reading this book. It must have been about ten in the night. I had cleared my study desk, and unlike my common practice of lying on my stomach on my bed to enjoy a book into the night, I sat down on the straight-backed chair at the desk to read it. Very soon, I was overwhelmed by the narrative of Mr. Hardy. My father came in to see what I was up to, saw the tears streaming down my face as I turned the pages of my book, and quietly went away. I have never before owned any story books- my parents told me to read out of libraries. But now I am 22, and have started earning some money of my own, and I'm going to start a little collection of my most beloved books, to pass on to my children, perhaps? And this is among my very best.

review/text: Poor production from the early-mid 80's cannot be corrected with a "remaster" attempt. I purchased it directly from the company a few months back. With the greatest respect for the lady giving the sewing instruction who can be your best friend's mom up the street, the production values are so low and filming techniques so outdated as to be useless to observe. They make use of a mirror on her work surface, a camera does not go right into her work much of the time and contrasts are low. Editing was also very choppy at times. The resolution is so poor that I could not see critical details. It just isn't easy to see what she is doing half of the time.Good solid information is given for beginners but I cannot recommend this product. Not good value for the price. I honestly believe the company should scrap it (and the series assuming the rest are like this) and start over.

review/text: I've read a bit about Anne Boleyn and the rest of Henry VIII's court and many wives, so I was intrigued by this book in spite of the flashy movie tie-in cover. Like most, I had no previous knowledge of Mary Boleyn's life. The factual evidence that Mary was Henry's mistress for 2-3 years, together with the timing of the births of her first two children would certainly give great credence to the theory that they were Henry's children, as well as the many honors which were granted to her family during that time. It would also seem very unlikely that Henry would have tolerated Mary bedding both him and her husband during the years of Henry's favor.Regardless of the accuracy of Ms Gregory's narratives relating to the maneuvers of her father and uncle in getting her into Henry's bed, or what Mary may or may not have thought about the role of women in her era, I think the author is owed a few bows for bringing this bit of history to wider audiences than serious Tudor scholars. Certainly the 4 or 5 biographies of this era that are in my personal library scarcely mention Mary at all. Ms Gregory has written an interesting and very readable tale, one that kept me turning the pages.

review/text: An excellent book that I thoroughly enjoyed. Bought the paperback for less than $3, yet Amazon & the greedy publisher think I'd be dumb enough to pay $13 for the Kindle ebook??? Was thinking about buying a Kindle. After looking at the Kindle prices of most books still covered by copyright, though, I definitely will not. I can buy the REAL book for about the same price brand-new in most cases, and substantially cheaper if I buy a used copy. Besides a truly backward price, with a Kindle version I'd also lose the ability to do any of the following: lend out my books anytime I want to anybody I choose, donate them to libraries or secondhand stores, or trade them in for credit towards other books at a used bookstore. Net result: current ebooks = epic FAIL on value.

I have used the TRV608 for a wide array of events, my kids are involved in music and sports so I have used the camcorder in many different situations indoors and out with outstanding results. One of my children used the camera for a &quot;movie&quot; for a school project and made a great grade.I am very pleased. The clarity is amazing and the low level performance is incredible. An S-video cable does help the video image. Perhaps one of the other reviewers had a bad camcorder, but I am glad I chose this camcorder.Sony reliability and quality is hard to beat. The only drawback I see at this time is the audio quality isn't up to digital, but since I wanted the better lowlight performance I went analog. Perhaps as the digital technology improves in lowlight I will go digital.

review/text: The blurb on the dust jacket says: &quot;a provocative and important book that will profoundly change our understanding both of Islamist politics and the way America is perceived in the world.&quot;This is probably true. The book presents a view of the Muslim world that is quite different from others such as Huntington's &quot;Clash of Civilizations&quot; which holds that the next big struggles between Muslims and the Christians will be the world's next big battlefield based on cultural differences. Mamdani sees the Muslim's current actions as an extension of the Cold War. (He grew up in Africa, among who's nations the US and the Soviet Union fought the war.) That he is probably right does not alter Huntington's view in my mind.I'd also like to see a chapter, maybe two, on the impact of oil on the crisis. Would 9/11 have happened if Iraq's invasion of Kuwait hadn't happened right over the oil we need to import?I further question some of his historical aspects. Mohammed was both a religious and military leader. (He was pretty good until he came up against one of the Greats - Genghis Kahn.) There seems to be to me more of an emphasis on uniting the two in the current Muslim thinking.I really like his closing statement: &quot;To win the fight against terrorism requires accepting that the world has changed, ... that to occupy foreig places will be expensive, in lives and money. America cannot occupy the world. It has to live in it.

Given his flawless interpretive skills, with every heartfelt lyric, listeners are truly transported to another place. &quot;Run to Me,&quot; &quot;I Survived You,&quot; and &quot;No More Sad Songs&quot; are PERFECT examples of this. Like Bolton, Aiken has an AMAZING instinct for what songs fit his voice, an ability that takes some singers years to acquire.

Are all English and Americans really good? There were so many subplots it was hard to keep track of what was going on. Each subplot was mentioned in each chapter and many had nothing to do with the main plot. Made you wonder why they were written other that to just fill paper.Turtledove missed a good opportunity here to write a classic science fiction novel.

review/text: Ghostface just doesn't make bad albums, you should know that by now. If you like Ghostface's style of rap (mile-a-minuet jargon or intricately detailed story telling) then you're be ready for another great installment to his career. If you don't like his style, which is not for everyone, that's fine: The Pretty Toney Album is probably not for you.The thing that takes this album to the next level is the sampling style and production. The majority of the songs are heavy in soul samples, straddling the line between creativity and blatant jacking. Somehow, to Ghost's credit it just works. Although Ghost uses a host of producers, it flows really well together and the styles don't seem that different from each other.The intro sets the stage for Pretty Toney, Ghost makes this music for the art and himself... not to please everyone. So either get behind him or step back. "Biscuits" sets things off nicely with True Master production using an uncredited sample. [...] is a quick typical dark RZA track."Beat The Clock" is the first incredible track. Minnesota provides the fast paced beat, which sends Ghost literally racing. "Metal Lungies" is another outstanding track, which uses some nice deep horns over a dark beat provided by No I.D. Sheek & Styles only add to this track, which has a Wu-Tang feel to it. "It's Over" uses an almost identical piano loop from Biggie's "Who Shot Ya?", although it's not noticeable at all, since the track takes a completely different direction. Ghost goes into his story-telling mode on this one, he's been one of the most consistent at doing this for the past decade."Holla" & "Save Me Dear" do something I'm not sure I've heard before. They both have Ghost rapping not just over soul samples, but the entire original song. I'll admit it was a weird experience hearing The Delfonics "La-La (Means I Love You)" in entirety easily recognizable in the background of "Holla". After I got over the initial shock, I realized the way Ghost's lyrics match up with the original song make this truly exceptional. "Be This Way" is also heavy with this soul sample of Billy Stewart, ghost flips it into a dark depressing track. This is one of my favorite tracks on the album; Nottz's production is just incredible."Run" could be in the running for Ghost's best track ever. RZA just brings a sick beat, that's got that ominous Wu-Tang song yet creates a sense of urgency. Police and sirens in the background only help out. The whole song really pulls together on the concept of being on the run from the police, plus Jadakiss and Ghostface rhymes are both clever and well paced. Defiantly the best track on the album."Tush" has some great production and is sure to have some people loving the track. As many that like it will hate it because of Missy's spot or the "single" quality of it. I can see people's opinion either way, but it doesn't cause a problem on this album even if you want to skip it. "Love" is a pretty solid introspective song, yet it lacks the production and emotion that Ghost's previous tracks like this have had (see "All That I Got Is You").Two skits are actually short songs, rapped like short stories: "Keisha's House" & "Last Night." The latter especially will have you questioning why it was cut so short. The other skits don't take away from the album and are typical Ghostface skits (lots of yelling, mostly incoherent dialogue. Ghost fans should be used to this.)There are some missteps on this album. "Ghostface" has a really weak beat, wack chorus, and has nothing to bring to the table. "Tooken Back" is just really silly and Jackie-O simply is not welcome.As a quick note, it's worth mentioning that Def Jam should have paid up for the samples and allowed Ghost to release the album as it was originally presented, it is a classic. The tracks left off would seriously take this album to untouchable status.At the end of the album, the big thing that makes you look past the missteps is the fact that you can listen to the other tracks over and over again. I've had this album since it came out and I can honestly say, while it's not the best I've bought this past year, it's easily one that I listen to the most. There's just something about it that makes multiple listens not just easy, but something that you want. You know an album is really good when you just keep finding it going back into your system after a long period of time. It might not be the best album of the year, and it might not even be the best of Ghostface Killah's catalogue, but The Pretty Toney Album is certainly going to have you listening to it as if it was.

But after reading Lene's book, I came to realize how strenuous and physically challenging it is to climb Everest. I was not aware of all the work and risks that are taken just to prepare for the final assault. Lene proved herself, showing incredible strength, fortitude and emotion. There must have been such a terrible sense of despair and fear knowing that death was probably inevitable and no help available.Lene gives the reader another perspective of this awesome event, using her professional knowledge as a clinician and writer. I would recommend everyone who has followed this climbing event, either from past magazine articles and stories, or from the several books written about this Everest climb, to read this book.

review/text: Here Kevin Phillips combines three modern political trends into a very compelling historical analysis. This includes America's ignorance of growing problems in energy resources, religious and political fundamentalism, and national debt. These three troublesome scenarios are covered in plenty of other books that deal with one of them exclusively. Phillips goes through each a little more sketchily than they deserve, but he has a winning sense of historical developments, in that these same trends were evident in the collapses of previous Western empires. The parallels that Phillips finds with old imperial downfalls are extremely worrisome for the thinking American, and he provides plenty of strong historical and statistical evidence. This entails the current administration's severe ideological addiction to oil, the influence of a growing conservative religious lobby on social and military policy, and an economy focused on credit and investment rather than manufacturing and development. Plus a governing style controlled by yes-men, a pandering to conservative extremism, and bombastic military hubris. This is an effective thesis from Phillips, and he has added credibility as a knowledgeable and informed Republican strategist.But while this book's conclusions are solid, there are some flaws in the way Phillips put his triple-pronged thesis together. Part I, about oil and energy policy, is thin and perfunctory, and is mostly quoted from stronger books on that subject (such as the masterful works of Paul Roberts and Michael T. Klare); while Phillips commits one severe oversight in forgetting about the massive subsidies enjoyed by the fossil fuels companies, which keep them artificially profitable and entrenched in the status quo while also unfairly holding back alternative technologies. Part II, in which Phillips analyzes the growing influence of Southern religion and culture on national politics, is the strongest and most chilling section of the book. We find that Southerners have now nationally fomented their culture of good/evil indignation, myopic millennialism (why talk about long-term social and economic policy when the Rapture is just around the corner?), and fundamentalist hostility to Church-and-State issues and world politics. However, Phillips misses the point that the Bush administration mostly coddles this coalition for the votes, and his mini-hypothesis about the Christian Right's collusion with the oil and credit industries is a bit of a stretch, socially and religiously. Part III focuses on the looming collapse of the American economy due to ballooning debt and speculative bubbles, and this portion is terrifyingly informative, though rather tiresome as Phillips tries to prop up the argument with a parade of repetitive statistics.In general, Phillips is really on to something here, and while the book is occasionally alarmist, the open-minded reader will see that there are real cautionary tales in his historical analysis. However, the overall three-part political philosophy just doesn't quite come together. But still, anyone concerned with America's future direction will be considerably swayed by this book's mostly powerful arguments. [~doomsdayer520~]

review/text: Those familiar with Laurie Sheck's three other books will find her latest to be an impressive expansion on her vivid imagery drawn from urban or ancient settings as she now ventures into the black of the Nevada Test Site, among other places. Anyone who has visited the haunting Mercury, Nevada cannot fail to be captivated by Laurie's poem Traces. We who read The Store Windows Glitter in the Boston Review last year and were gasping for more will not be disappointed, as she continues with The Mannequins to explore and contrast the living and the inanimate.Laurie has once again crystallized the meaning of urban life in The Subway Platform, which is in some ways a poetic parallel to Cristina Peri Rossi's The Crack in The Museum of Useless Efforts, though Laurie's poem is more personal and intense.Readers who enjoyed Laurie's previous works on ancient subjects will find much to enchant here, such as Medusa and Pompeii. It is this contrast between the past and contemporary worlds that makes these poems a compelling read. Cave paintings compared with urban grafitti (in separate poems) are but one example of the startling imagery that permeates this book.Another aspect of these poems that elevates them above much of today's poetry is their sense of the impact of computers and technology on our lives. In reading most poets writing today, one would never know that computers or advanced technology exist at all, as these dominant aspects of life are largely ignored. Laurie's poem Circuits is but one illustration of how this book responds to our electronic environment and makes a literary statement that any reader can appreciate.Note: The title of this review is a variant on the title of Moynihan's Maximum Feasible Misunderstanding. The misunderstanding here concerns a rather pathetic review of Black Series that appeared in the New York Times in which the critic displayed a complete ignorance of what Laurie's poetry is. Without belaboring the point, that reviewer felt that Black Series needs more &quot;precision,&quot; a charge so ridiculous that it reminds me of a critic of Emily Dickinson's &quot;I taste a liquor never brewed/From tankards scooped in pearl&quot; who disliked the poem because he believed pearl to be an inadequate material for making a beverage container. That's about as much sense as the NYT review makes, so ignore it.Black Series is a book to buy and enjoy through multiple readings. The subject matter is astonishingly diverse, and the poems are much more intense than most being written today. This book is a feast for the reader.

review/text: "Adam Sandler's Eight Crazy Nights" could have been a really sweet Christmas story with a heartwarming message at its core. Instead, it's a vile, heartless animated feature that swerves back and forth between naughty and nice, not sure what to become. Take, for instance, the scene towards the end, when the mayor of Dukesbury (voiced by Kevin Nealon) cracks a very unfunny joke in the town hall, and the citizens of Dukesbury start to snort snot all over their tables, and some deer outside get in such a violent fit of laughter that feces squirts from behind their tails with little *splurt* sounds.Does that sound like a good-natured family comedy to you? That's because it isn't. The film stars, in one way or another, Adam Sandler, who has finally found a suitable medium to let loose all his crudeness without (a) getting the film banned from every country in the world, and (b) injuring himself in the process. Because there's something innocent about cartoons. In "Eight Crazy Nights," his self-crafted character, Davey Stone, is on the run from the town police after ripping off a Chinese man (voiced by Rob Schneider). He picks up the lid of a trashcan and slides down a railing like Vin Diesel did in "xXx." It's funny to see a limitless and physically fit Sandler, yes, but right as the scene starts to become fun, we get a worn out gag involving squeezed melons that has been done countless times before, including last year's "Austin Powers in Goldmember."Davey resents the holidays, and he especially resents the "eight crazy nights" of Hanukkah, because when he was 12 years old his parents died on their way to his basketball game. Ever since, Davey has been the town troublemaker, getting stoned (hence his last name?) and making out with cars. (Don't ask.)Davey gets picked up by the cops and is sentenced to ten years in jail, when the town eccentric, Whitey (also voiced by Sandler), offers the judge to make Davey a basketball referee in hopes of changing his ill spirits. The judge agrees, but as soon as Davey leaves court he throws Whitey into a porta-potty and knocks it down a hill. Whitey emerges with human feces all over his body, and Davey then sprays him with water, saying, "See ya' later, poopsicle."That's why the film careens from gross-out gags to heartwarming moments and then back to juvenile bodily function jokes. You've probably heard a lot of people complain about bodily function humor and how bad it is, but this will disgust the most crude and vile audience members. I did for me. (Hey, I'm joking! About being crude. Er...never mind.)A lot of people hate Adam Sandler and his humor, but I think they're just all jumping on the bandwagon. Ironically, his "breakthrough role" in P.T. Anderon's 2002 art film "Punch-Drunk Love" has been praised as his crowning triumph. I, personally, still enjoy "Happy Gilmore" and "Big Daddy." His comedies are very basic but also, on occasion, very funny. I also like "Saturday Night Live"-type humor a lot, so that may have something to do with it.Is "Eight Crazy Nights" a bad movie? I guess. It's hard to place a finger on. It's mean-spirited and vile, and that's where the film fails, but when the film has its touching moments they are touching. Too bad it always has to ruin the mentioned scenes by ending them with lame poop and/or seizure jokes. Again, don't ask.

review/text: My partner is a Chinese Medicine Acupuncturist and Herbalist. Her basic education took 5 years to complete. Five years later, she still takes many supplementary courses each year to continue her education. Most of her free time is spend with distance learning courses or reaching herbs. Chinese Medicine is vast and deep. A 5 year basic study is not nearly enough time to understand this medicine. In Chinese Medicine, they say even a lifetime is not long enough to understand this medicine. Thankfully for the lay person we have this book!I personally own 2 copies of this book. One I have at home, the other is in our Chinese Medicine office. Many of our patients have purchased their own copy of this book after reading our office copy.The Complete Illustrated Guide to Chinese Medicine is the best book that I have read to understand what my partner practices. I have read other books, likeThe Web That Has No Weaver : Understanding Chinese MedicineandBetween Heaven and Earth: A Guide to Chinese Medicine, although highly recommended, these 2 books are much more technical and can be overwhelming at times (especially The Web 2nd edition). After reading The Complete Illustrated Guide, if you want to learn more then these other two books are worth a read. Far and away the best dietary book on Chinese Medicine is Bob Flaw'sThe Tao of Healthy Eating: Dietary Wisdom According to Traditional Chinese Medicine. Also,The Book of Jook: Chinese Medicinal Porridges--A Healthy Alternative to the Typical Western Breakfastby Bob Flaws is a good helpful for breakfast food and as a total diet longevity practice (similar to Kitchari in Ayurveda).The Complete Illustrated Guide to Chinese Medicine provides a complete overview of all of the modalities included under the largre umbrella of Chinese Medicine. You'll learn about the medicine theory, diagnosis, energetic "anatomy", acupuncture, herbal medicine, diet, exercise, qi gong, tai chi, meditation, and lifestyle theory.The section on diet is lacking, in my opinion, however the author does state that information on diet could fill an entire book itself - which is definitely true. ReadThe Tao of Healthy Eating: Dietary Wisdom According to Traditional Chinese Medicinefor proper Chinese Medicine dietary knowledge.The sections on Qi Gong and Tai Chi are great for a general book. You'll be taught a basic sequence in each. For additional learning, Mantak Chia's books and DVDs are some of the most complete spiritual-style Qi Gong practices practices. Dr. Yang Jwing-Ming has created some of the best martial arts style Qi Gong and Tai Chi books and DVDs.The theory and science sections make up the majority of this book, providing an excellent introduction with much knowledge and no fluff. Someone interesting in attending TCM school would greatly benefit by reading this book first. You'll understand what TCM is and have good preparation for the conceptual basis of Chinese Medicine.The entire book is filled with pictures to support the information. A picture is worth 1,000 words and many times it is only through pictures that proper understanding can be attained (like meridians, tongue diagnosis, etc). The book is very well organized with section titles and concise paragraphs with subtitles. It is clear that the authors spent much time and calculation to create this book.Personally, I can't think of anything missing from this book. Although I would have liked to see another 2-4 pages on dietary theory and practice, it is not strong enough of a complaint to remove a star from my rating. This book is 5 stars all the way!Additional note:It is important to remember that Chinese Medicine is a medicine and should only be practiced by a trained professional. There is a lot that a person can do to improve health and grow spiritually without the help of a Chinese Medicine practitioner/doctor - like diet, exercise, meditation, qi gong, yoga, etc. However when it comes to deeper knowledge and practices like Acupuncture and Herbal Medicine, these are best left to the professionals. My partner is a professional Chinese Medicine Acupuncturist and Herbalist. It is common that people come into her office who are worse off after having self-treated using herbal knowledge from books, magazines, and newscasts. Taking herbs for symptom relief is not anywhere close to the Chinese Medicine herbal understanding. If you are suffering from health problems, please see a professional.After it's complete, an education in Chinese Medicine is a 5 year Ph.D. program (including both Acupuncture and Herbal Medicine). This is an entire year longer than Western Medicine. This is not to say that Chinese Medicine is superior, but rather that both studies are long and difficult. Chinese Medicine should not be looked at to be inferior to modern Western medicine. Rather both are complete forms of medicine and require much more understanding than can be gained by a single text book.The Complete Illustrated Guide to Chinese Medicine is the best place to start to better understand what Chinese Medicine is and how you can live a healthier and happier life.Was my review helpful?

review/text: Beat Takeshi provides another violent movie, whose purpose seems to be that violence begets violence, and ultimately it's a dead end. The basic plot has Takeshi playing a yakuza forced to leave Japan upon the death of his boss. He finds his half brother in LA pushing drugs rather than attending school. Takeshi violently turns the small time crew into a major crime cartel.Yakuza themes of loyalty to family and honor over life pervade the movie. The omnipresent violence somehow avoids being gratuitous, perhaps because one realizes how more graphic it could have been. Unlike traditional western shoot 'em ups, we are left with the aftermath instead of the fight scenes themselves. At times it is hard to follow the plot and remember who is on whose sides, but perhaps that is the point.

review/text: If you're thinking of buying the soundtrack to Final Fantasy VII, get this album and no other. If you've played through the game you'll find that most, if not all, the songs you'd want to keep are in it. Most noteworthy, and the real reason why anyone would buy this album, are the final three tracks.I'm no collector of video game music, but the quantum leap in emotion and quality that was derived from merely translating a MIDI format song to pure orchestration definitely warranted at the very least my applause.The orchestrated main theme starts of with a subtle pizzicato that captures the moment you (as Cloud Strife) step outside of Midgar and be thrust into a huge new world. The feelings of wonder, excitement, adventure, and brooding darkness that is the Final Fantasy VII experience are truly expressed in this rich composition.One-Winged Angel is much more dark and powerful in this rendition. The choir did not have as much &quot;oomph&quot; as I wished but they nevertheless were spellbinding. To be true to the composition the horrible &quot;cartoony&quot; portions were still played, though somewhat compensated with not only excellent orchestration, but a few added parts by the vocals and instruments.As good as the last two discussed tracks were, the most heart-wrenching and emotionally rending piece is the orchestrated Aeris' Theme. It starts with the piano notes that captured us in the game, then gets richer (albeit a bit repetitive) as the notes are played by different instruments. Still, absolutely beautiful and masterfully translated. Good job, Uematsu-san.

review/text: I was intrigued, horrified, and was ashamed for humanity in reading this book. It was well worth the read. I was cheering for the whales and actually felt good when the whale attacked and sank the ship!! Thank heavens for the environmental movement. It is overwhelmingly sad that so many tortoises and whales met their end during those days. Quite interesting, however, that we killed so many more whales in the 1900's than they did in that (and previous centuries) because of improved technology!The environmental movement has helped tremendously to save these great mammals, though I recently read that Japan is going to be killing whales again! And they are voracious eaters of creatures from the sea. I only hope they have strict limitations.The book was very educational, and you feel you are a part of the whaling community of Nantucket in the early 1800s as you read it.

review/text: This book suffers from; 1. terrible writing and 2. a story that is only mildly interesting in the first place.The writing:Somewhere in the book it is mentioned that Holtel is a man of few words. This becomes painfully obvious in the first few pages of the book. The book is basically a day by day journal of his runs. Every day's entry reads pretty much the same - difficult hills, rocky descents, etc. He does little, if anything, to describe the beauty surrounding him, the people he encounters, or even a brief history of the trail.The story:The author likes to say that he "ran the Pacific Crest Trail". While this is technically true he did not cover it in one stretch - as I think most people would assume from this statement. It took him over three summers to cover the distance. This undoubtedly was a great way to spend three summers but in my book it doesn't make him out to be the great hero he would like to be.He also likes to repeatedly tell about how difficult it was and how amazed everyone he met on the way was when he told them what he was doing. This gets very tiresome very fast.

review/text: Usually, a CD like this would meet with at least some approval from me. Inoffensive, fairly upbeat, and with some pretty lyrics...if this was from an unknown, struggling artist, it would be acceptable. But from Clay Aiken? The man who almost won American Idol and who is supposedly (at least to some) the best singer in the country? No, I'm sorry to say that coming from such a person, this CD just isn't enough.As said, there is nothing really terrible about &quot;Measure of a Man,&quot; but nothing really great, either. It is all sort of vaguely nice. I listened to most of all the songs on this CD, and it's telling that that not a single one &quot;jumped out&quot; at me. On a good CD, I will often listen to it the first time and certainly not memorize every song, but know the ones that I definitely want to listen to a second time. But everything on &quot;Measure of a Man&quot; kind of blends. It's all &quot;kind of pop&quot; and all mildly schmaltzy love songs. To make matters worse, I didn't get much of a &quot;feel&quot; for Aiken's voice-most of the time the cliche upbeat background is drowning him out.If you like this sort of genre, try Josh Groban. Yes, he's a little different from Clay-more &quot;classical&quot; and less mainstream-yet his voice is stunning and his material usually shows it. Yes, bubblegum pop such as this may be fine, but why settle for it when there are better &quot;musical sweets&quot; around?

review/text: ...you should acquire this title. It's encyclopedic in scope on the topic of garlic, and L.J. Harris has a lively writing style and a passion for the subject that keeps it from ever becoming stuffy or long-winded. Health Quarterly described him in their review as "kindly, mischievous and talented". Included are chapters on references to garlic in the Talmudic and Mohammedan traditions and quotes from Pliny and Virgil that are surprisingly contemporary in their points of view about health and society. Herbalist and culinary traditions from China and India are represented, as are the viewpoints of the British (alliophobic) and the French (alliocentric, depending on geography and politics). Literary lore, folk medicine, herbalist tradition, and culture & politics all contribute to this very readable volume. My two favorite recipes were Puerto Rican Garlic & Egg Soup, and Nancy's Artichoke Pie.

review/text: When I saw the depressing amount of 1-, 2-, and 3-star reviews for this novel, I had to wonder what had gotten into the general populace. Then I read the actual reviews, and realized something. They are reading this for pleasure, yes - but why in the world to people turn to a classic novel for a fast-paced, action-packed story? (Yes, I quote.)Tess's is a dark tale, a depressing tale, a tale with no perky moments to speak of (seeing as how we all know it'll get that much worse should anything good happen). The language is poetic and ethereal, with descriptions of incredible beauty that I would give anything to have written and an overtone of intense tragedy and ill-fated cruelty. The characters are all conflicted and in turmoil, oppressed by the moral standards of the day, and Tess is likeable, as opposed to Emily Bronte's Catherine Earnshaw, say. I would like to mention that I chose this book to write a ten-page analytical paper on, know it cover-to-cover, and know that it is SO much more meaningfull when one stops to take in the paragraphs that scream, "Pay attention to ME!!!" I would also mention that I am not a college professor. I read this as a high-school freshman, which goes to show that this isn't just a book for the elite.And in relation to all the readers who feel that Hardy is a bad author? I always believe that people who act as though they can write a classic far better than the author really ought to try their hand at writing a story that will survive the ages as well as Tess. Hardy writes in lyrical prose, in similar style to his poetry, and though I completely understand wanting to read "mind candy", I don't understand expecting books accepted as real literature to do the trick. Maybe try a trashy novel first, and read Tess to cleanse the palate.This is, ultimately, my favorite novel of all time. Naturally, I have many more to read, but of all those I have tried, I have never read another that so seamlessly combined luminous tragedy, heartwrending romance, and cruel fate in a novel as beautiful as it is painful.

review/text: But sometimes it seems that way and for New York lawyer Ron Sinzheimer, on October 9, 1998, it was beyond dangerous, it was deadly. There aren't any more General Aviation accidents here than other parts of the country and there's nothing particularly stunning about this one so there's little reason to remember it. A man and the family dog in a single engine Grumman Traveler flying into the Cape to link up with his wife and son at their vacation home. Because I remember this accident, live nearby in Brewster, and it speaks to something of keen interest to me, my perception of the book may be quite colored and thus this &quot;five-star&quot; review. Nevertheless Phaedra Hise has written a compelling story that will be of interest to a much broader audience than GA pilots and people who live on the Cape.The challenges associated with flying to and from the Cape are all to do with weather, specifically fog and haze. That means &quot;instrument flight rules&quot; and talking about flying as different from &quot;visual flight rules&quot; as night is from day. Besides the personal tragedy to the Sinzheimer family, the thrust of Hise's book is that once a pilot has lost visual reference to the horizon things very quickly begin to unwind. It takes a sharp pilot to sort out the conflict between what his senses say - &quot;i'm turning&quot; - and what the instruments read - wings are level. PILOT ERROR is too innocuous a description for the multitude of things (mostly bad) that are taking place in such situations. Sometimes the various instruments seem to be contradicting each other and you must fight the panic that comes when your mind screams that it needs a visual reference in order to understand.Hise could have used a famous case that everyone would have remembered in order to get across her message that instrument flight rules are a critical skill for any GA pilot. The struggle with understanding what his instruments were telling him was the same for John F Kennedy Jr when he was flying through haze on the way to Martha's Vineyard in 1999. Using his flight would have meant focusing on him rather than where the real story is - five small instrument dials, that GA pilots must be absolutely familiar with - lest we become an accident statistic or the subject of a powerfully descriptive and very well written book.

review/text: This book was horrible.I had to read it but in my own opinion this book really had nothing to do with witches.They only mentioned a few things about withches.For example ,when the main character{Kit}jumped in the water to save the little girl's doll,they just mentioned she could get in trouble for swimming.Another example of this would be how Kit was put on trail.They just said she was but it would have made the story a lot more interesting by adding the twist that she was found guilty. The story was actually about how dating worked back in colonial times.The author mentioned that in order to go out with someone that the male had to ask the father's permission in order to call on the female.An example of this would be when an admirer of Kit{William Ashby} asked Kit's uncle if he could call her out.He did this by sucking up to him then asking him his permission.In conclusion, my once again is that this book has nothing to do with witches or witch craft.

This boils down to the fact that you need to start making noise 5 or 6 seconds before you say anything that will be heard on the other end.The sport club that I belong to, makes heavy use of the sub channels (there are so many people using FRS type radios now... you REALLY shouldn't bother buying anything that doesn't have sub channels).From the reviews I've read, these guys have come a LONG way from their early models. However, without the sub channels, and with such a delay in the VOX feature... it's a neat "toy," but they still have a bit more to go before they become truly useful.-D

Most of the time, I listen to them once. &quot;Stone Dog Soup&quot; is one that I want to hear again and again. Between Guy Clark's exquisite writing style, his exceptional musician friends, and his outstanding taste in choosing music that he hasn't written to interpret for the listeners, this cd is worth the price of admission. The wide range of styles--from the title cut to &quot;Sis Draper&quot;--brings Guy Clark alive into your living room or the cd player in your car. After hearing this one, it was difficult to move on to the many others I needed to preview. Now I'm buying two more for friends. This is, as they say in Texas, a good 'un. Make that a great 'un.

review/text: This is one of Lewis's most famous and oft-quoted works, and for good reason. It is an honest and intelligent - not to mention brilliantly written - examination of the many facets of the Christian faith and human nature: the existence of and belief in God, the Trinity, faith, love, pride, morality etc. Although written during World War Two, the subjects explored still resonate powerfully with contemporary concerns.I found the opening chapters particularly helpful in presenting a well-argued case for the rational foundations of Christianity, or at least belief in the existence of God. It offers a challenge to Christians to question the intellectual grounds for their faith, and the reassurance that sufficient answers can be found. Non-Christians looking to investigate the rational basis of Christianity, or of religion in general, will also find this an accessible and thought-provoking read.The book is also an ideal place to start for anyone thinking to dip into the non-fiction works of C. S. Lewis. No book in my opinion gives the reader a better first taste of the prolific author's delicious prose, keen intellect and razor-sharp wit.I cannot recommend this book more.

I plan to buy this jacket in some other colors now that I have the proper size. This is a great easy wearing piece for any professional woman young or old.

review/text: Reading a book that is both erotic and literary is always a treat. Alma Marceau's Lofting is one of the most exquisite erotic novels ever written. As fiendishly graphic as it is beautifully philosophical, Lofting chronicles the unraveling of a woman's electrifying sexual desire. She has decided to surrender her body to her master, but little did she anticipate that she'd end up surrendering her heart...Lofting is full of wonderful imagery and poetic undertones. To describe this novel as erotic is putting it mildly. It is an extraordinary piece of work, beautiful and lyrical. There are some humorous moments as well. Are you in the bargain for literary erotica? I suggest you pick up this incredible book.

review/text: Since I heard once on vynil the incredible apssionate and to me the greatest version of the First Symphony of Johannes Brahms ever made .And believe me , I love this symphony and I have heard at least one hundred versions : with Furtwangler , Toscanini superb performance of the forties , Istvan Kertsez , Kubelik Chicago , Munch , and a long etc .But the inner mood and the clear but cleverly established sequence of the right tone and the use of the concise tempo in every phrase make of that version unique and unrepeteable .I know about the Mozart Symphonies with the Berlin Philarmonic that still in those ages sounded with the furtwanglerain mood . They are sublime .But consider once more that only with this Brahms Symphony, all the rest of the set you may regard a special buy , a worthable and fundamental bonus. Igor Markevitch was a conductor unfairly neglected .Buy this CD because it will let you astonished and will prove by itself all the virtues of that master conductor .

review/text: I read this in the 1980's, and it was a non-event back then. Like most books that claim to have "the answer," this book gives an enormously over-simplified view of economics that does not reflect the real world. Moreover, it presents as settled many open questions, claiming the authors opinions as facts. There are many better books on free-market economics, and far, far better books on economics in general.

review/text: This book is one of the classics on Timber Framing for those who want to get into this type of construction or build their own house. It is a very easy read. Though sometimes the author tends towards to much philosophy about life, construction and wood working.This book has very useful sections on joinery, design, raising, engineering, load physics, etc. Very easy to understand even if, like me, you are not a professional carpenter, contractor or mechanical engineer. I know nothing of contracting or building and understood the whole book.The book does not mention anything about Scribe Rule and Square Rule techniques and the differences between the two. These old techniques may not have been widely known when this book was written, although they were well known by early timber frame carpenters, before Timber Framing was replaced with cheaper, but faster Balloon Framing.A book that does go into Square Rule in a more structured way and is equally easy to read is Buid a Classic Timber-Framed House, by Jack Sobon.

Mr. Cheney's wife is named Lynn, not Liz. Aside from the ad hominen attack on our V.P., I wonder how many other errors might be found in Mr. Wallace's ponderous review, if I had time & energy to check?I haven't read the book, so I can't really rate it on content. However, if you can judge a person by the company they keep, then I can see that this book contains too much common sense, objective reality, and documented evidence for a liberal reader to stomach.

If you liked Tropico, Rollercoaster Tycoon, you'll love Virtual Resort: Spring Break.It has 11 or 12 levels in which you go through and fix several problems given a selected amount of time. It's a little rough but very addicting!! And in no time you're figure out what to do and be successful. With every level you complete you unlock that island to play in sandbox mode for later on.I give the game 5 stars for good graphics, fun play and ease of use!! Check it out!!

review/text: I came across this novel by accident while trying to satisfy my daily addition, books on tape. Red Sky at Morning is a charming and humorous documentation of the complexity of teen years - the challenges of bullies, the development of sarcasm as a tool for pleasure and protection, the fear and anxiety of impending sexual maturity, and the bonding for long-lasting friendships. Richard Bradford kept me rivited and smiling. Only Mark Twain can claim a similar acheivement. This now part of my personal library to cherish again and again.

review/text: ...Anyway, Eight Crazy Nights is the exact oppposite of Adam Sandler's preceding film, Punch Drunk Love. And in the first 15 minutes of it, Sandler loses all "critical credibility" that he gained in his last movie... which isn't &lt;i>necessarily&lt;/i> a bad thing...The movie tries to be too many things at once. It attempts to be a grossout teen-flik while at the same time, tries to be the warmhearted holiday film.Overall, if you like adam sandler, see it. it'll be worth... yyeaahh..

review/text: My name is Kevin Olson I am a senior at walla walla high school and I recently read the book 1984, I really enjoy most science fiction books, but in 1984 I had complaints about the fact that I felt like i was outside looking down on the characters instead ofbeing along side of them during the different ordeals through out the story. the mood generally seemed hopeless in both the beginning and the ending. I think that it was like a movie with a very bad ending. so if you want to watch a movie thats based on this book, but has a better ending then go ahead and watch the movie equilibrium.

review/text: The disparity between the contents of this book and its title may be judged by comparing a comment on the back cover with a section of the main text:Back cover:&quot;Rakoff - who was intended by McGoohan to play a key role in the scripting of future episodes - now reveals how the series could have developed, then and now.&quot;Main text (p.176, col. 1)&quot;McGoohan's promise that I'd have four episodes in the next tranche of the series was perhaps not seriously meant. It was probably only a well-meaning apology for having abandoned me in order to be free to go to Hollywood.&quot;In order to get this book in perspective you need to take full note of the subtitle - &quot;radical television and film in the 1960s&quot;.An even more accurate subtitle would have been &quot;Ian Rakoff, an autobiographical account of how I came to England and worked on a few films, and served as assistant editor on a couple of episodes of 'The Prisoner', during the 1960s&quot;.As Rakoff himself admits, he came &quot;in at the tail end of things&quot; (p23) as far as the making and editing of The Prisoner was concerned, and apart from a few brief and highly uncommunicative meetings with McGoohan, whatever he (Rakoff) knew about the series was gossip and hearsay.His version of the nature of the original 'Rover', for example, is clearly not from personal experience, and conflicts with evidence that there really was a blue VW 'beetle' with flashing light.He also suggests, for no good reason, that production manager Bernard Williams came up with the idea of using weather balloons; which doesn't tally with the more widespread report that McGoohan fortuitously spotted a weather balloon in flight and gave Williams the task turning this into a practical replacement for the VW bug.Not surprisingly, then, even that section of the main text that deals with the TV series (pages 23-100) consists almost entirely of vague anecdotes that are more likely to be of interest to film and TV technicians than to fans of the TV series. Nor is this section of the book entirely given over to items related to the making of The Prisoner, but regularly wanders off into pure autobiography, as in Chapters 5 and 7, for example.Having said all that, it might seem that Rakoff is still a key witness as regards the concepts and philosophy behind the TV series. After all, he did work as a writer on the series, didn't he?Well yes, sort of. It turns out that Rakoff wrote the basic story for the episode 'Living in Harmony' - but had very little to do with the final script. Indeed, on viewing the initial screening he comments:&quot;For a moment I couldn't believe I'd written any of what I was seeing. It seemed familiar but from somewhere far away and long ago. Dialogues struck chords.&quot; (p.98)The fact is that Rakoff based his own story on material in Gene Autrey (cowboy) comics of the 1950s. It's relevance to the central themes of The Prisoner was, (given his very limited time on the project), almost entirely co-incidental. And the episode as it was filmed and screened, owed nearly everything to series producer David Tomblin - who is credited as producer, scriptwriter and director on this particular episode.In short, if you're keen to lay your hands on 'anything' that relates to The Prisoner then you'll pobaby want to own this book as well.If, however, you're looking for material that provides genuine insights into this most enigmatic of all TV series then there are far better ways of spending your money.

review/text: Author Elizabeth MacKintosh, wrote under the pseudonym of Josephine Tey. She died in 1952 but her unique talent continues to entertain and enlighten her readers with her unusual mystery scenarios. With Daughter of Time she invites us to join the team of a 20th century Scotland Yard inspector Alan Grant and an American researcher currently on assignment at the British Museum as they utilized their powers of deductive reasoning (ala Sherlock Holmes) to ascertain the truth about with Richard III. Having been previously characterized by everyone from Shakespeare to Sir Thomas More as an evil hunchbacked usurper who murdered his two young nephews in the Tower of London in order to claim the throne; the Richard Plantagenet of this investigation is portrayed as an unusually trusting, loving and gentle man with no physical deformity.As creatively and intellectually plotted as this novel is, its' true beauty lies in the fact that it encourages the reader to THINK. It obliquely tells us that one should never accept any recorded history without question since most history is written from the perspective of those in power at the time and is not necessarily factual. In addition it enhances knowledge and vocabulary and sent this reader scurrying to the computer to look up definitions of items such as Bill of Attainder, Titulus Regius, and Star Chamber (lo and behold....it is more than a movie with Michael Douglas).Admittedly, this is a novel and the "Richard argument" presented by Tey's characters, although compelling, should not be viewed as incontrovertible fact. Her writing, however, deserves to be treasured and enjoyed like a fine wine that is rolled around on the tongue and savored before it is swallowed.

review/text: Are you in the mood for a movie as slow as molasses? Do you have a hankering for a mumbling, stumbling, celluloid hero that wanders around the house and gets lost in the woods? Then this film is for you.The only review that will do justice to this movie is a mumbling incoherent one, just like the flick. A little Q&A;:Q So how'd you like the movie?A Mmmf Pongloramin.Q What did you think of Blake/Cobain?A Alch Himlimsh.Q Thank you very much.A Yelcum Bermush.I think Van Sant and crew must've filmed this as a practical joke. He must've thought, "Gee, I have one more movie left in my contract. I think I'll just wing it. No script, no dialogue, let's just hang out at a swank college in upstate New York and soak up some indie/underground rock." Maybe they did it at Bard College. Bard/Blake -- get it?I will say that the music video is a lot better than the movie. It's a hilarious parody of Nirvana that's funnier than Weird Al Yanchovic -- but then again, Al isn't that funny. That video is more of a tribute to Kurt than this sorrowful excess of cinematic depression.If Van Sant had intended to punish his audience by ensconsing them within the mind of Kurt so they can experience his psychotic depression, he should've kept that deleted drum scene and expanded the dolly shot zooming in on his "performance" in the dark, dank room of the house.In the meantime, it'll have to do as a picture for hangover recovery.

review/text: This is the best guide available. Moon travel beats the major competitor (the main travel-trail eye-sore creator) in almost all respects, but not all.Moreso than other travel guides, the Moon travel guide for Vietnam, Laos, and Cambodia has tons and tons of recent political, social and economic history in addition to significant cultural notes that a visitor *must* be aware of. (i.e., what does a South East Asian smile mean?) The maps of the cities and provinces are excellent. the all-important overland border-crossings between 'Nam, Laos, and Cambo are cleary marked. This is one of the many reasons that Moon can't be beaten at the moment. This guide's overland itineraries are the best. Example: you want to go into China overland fron northern Vietnam. How can you get up to Kunnming, China? It tells ya. And, we learn, that the one way flight into Bangkok from Kunming is the same price as the one that flys from Hanoi. (This price equality of course must be verified).The information regarding the pricing and existence of certain establishments that cater to travelers is outdated. However, where to eat or sleep has never been an important part of a book anyhow, just the general information about the area in general and how to get there is all a visitor needs. Does someone need to read a guidebook to decide specifically where to eat? Where to specifically sleep? If it does for you, do everyone a favor: stay home.The underlying story that provides the "general-informational" foundation is enough. When we come through town, understandably we don't know much, but that is far better than knowing absolutely nothing at all, which is quite common now from my conversations with tourists, and especially now among "backpackers." The purpose of why backpacking started has been lost for most.By the way, it is a fact that the communist government censors this guidebook. I found that out trying to pick it up at the post office. Well worth having.

review/text: Well-developed leads, adorable baby, quirky characters and a sweet secondary romance...what more could one ask for in a good contemporary romance. I read this book in one sitting, it's that good. After a previous marriage that lasted less than a year, Annie went through a series of life changing decisions, partly with the help of her grandfather who speaks to her through billboard ads. Jake, on the other hand, is stuck in a rut after his wife died two years ago. When he began receiving letters from a fertility clinic thanking him for his &quot;contribution&quot; and offering to pay him for more &quot;contributions,&quot; he began to investigate. He found out that his sperm sample, which was actually meant for his wife before she died, had been &quot;deposited&quot; elsewhere, because of an unscrupulous doctor. And so the journey begins, to find a child he never knew he had....and along the way he discovers the child's mother who reads tea leaves, sells paca poop (paca poop comes from alpacas which are like llamas) and paints her toe nails in rainbow order.Baby, Oh, Baby is a lovely tale of finding new love and rediscovering passion. I'd recommend this book to anyone who loves a good contemporary romance - because that's what it is. A very good book. Robin Wells is one to watch.

review/text: Mr. Mamdani's book is a good read all through. His thesis is novel, arguments sound and conclusion is unbiased. His analysis of America's cold war policy of transition from containment to rollback is an eye-opener. Specially noteworthy is his observation of how covert operations undertaken during Reagan era in order to bypass obtaining funds from tax-payers' money through rampant act of aiding and abetting drug trafficking changed to Bush's approach of privatizing military with similar goal of keeping American people in dark regarding its imperial policy in Iraq and elsewhere. Also, his arguments showing parallel mind sets of imperial Europe and modern America regarding the practice of democratic despotism is laudable. European historians always argued in favor of colonizing &quot;lower&quot; races with the `sacred' interest to civilise and enlighten them, the so called &quot;White men's burden&quot; (Rudyard Kippling) and that mass slaughter (genocide), mass starvation and plundering natural wealth and enslavement to feed industrial revolution in their home countries are but the `collateral' damages. Similar `collateral' damages inflicted on the Third world countries in the name of containment during cold war and globalisation following that era by America bears all the diagnostic features of imperial Europe. Finally, I share his frustration when he concludes by saying that whereas serious efforts are being made by the world at large to restrain the terrorism of Muslim origin, an absolute lack of similar efforts to check American and Israeli fundamentalism (the Judeo-Christian terrorism) gives a helpless feeling.

review/text: One of the better books that I've read over the past year. Dr. Eby provides a biographical review of the miracles that God has performed in his life, beginning with his birth in the pre-depression era through the 1980's. I heard about this book on the radio and it was described as Dr. Eby's trip to heaven after his clinical death due to an accident. What I found was a wonderful collection of stories about how God worked miracles throughout his entire life, including an amazing story of his brief trip to heaven (he describes it in great detail -- I can't wait!) and a brief trip to hell (enough of a description to scare the salvation right into a non-believer). Dr. Eby is a great story teller and the book is very easy to read and enjoy. A very uplifting and &quot;feel good&quot; book. A great book to read to kids too!

review/text: I've never used this type of push-in wire connector before, although I've seen them used in the trade by others with mixed success. I finally decided to give it a try with a remodeling job where I had a lot of connections in several boxes and little room. Here's my experience:Wires must be stripped to the proper length. This is much more critical than with twist connectors (wire nuts). Too short and they won't make proper connection since they may not be able to insert fully, too long and you will have exposed bare wire which could make contact with other conductors or the box and equipment metal. Improper length is likely the main problem that people have had. The wire appears to make good contact inside the connector and the clear plastic allows you to see that (or if you need to push more wire in).You still need nearly as much free wire penetrating from the box. The two-wire connectors are easy to get aligned, but the multiple connectors need the wire length so you can get them pushed into the connector straight in and without bending the wire. I was unable to do this without using pliers except for the two-wire connectors, although with more experience it may become simpler. So unless you are really experienced, these are probably not faster.The real benefit is that (except for the two-wire connectors) these push-in connectors take much less room in the box, especially considering that with twist-type connectors, the wires must be all lined up parallel with each other for an inches or two before entering the connector. More than a couple of twist connectors containing three or more wires each and you are soon fighting for more box space. With these push-in connectors, each wire can bend in a different direction as soon as it leaves the conector.A final note. Removing solid wire from these connectors is easy: just rotate the wire while pulling it out. Stranded wires must be cut and the connector discarded and replaced.Amazon had the best price for the types that I needed, but if you only need a couple, you may be able to get a small selection from Lowes or Home Depot immediately and at less cost.

review/text: Kris Kristofferson's voice has sometimes been compared to a "croaking" frog. So, it is fitting that some of the best singers and Kris's friends should pay tribute to Kris and his 70th birthday by "breathing new life into his tunes"."Kristofferson was never much for easy. For most of his life, he craved both desperation and accomplishment. Or maybe he craved the kind of accomplishment that can only spring from desperation. Anyway, he threw himself into worlds of bruised-hearted trouble, of excess and alcohol and worry and peril. That everything all worked out in the end is one measure of the man. "All alone all the way on your own/ Who's to say that you've thrown it away for a song?" he once sang. Well, plenty of people said that about him." an interviewer said of him.This CD is everything The Legend would want; The producers selected Kristofferson's best songs and chose some major singers to interpret them. Willie Nelson, Roseanne Cash, Emmylou Harris and Rodney Crowell are so well known and would ensure the quality of this CD. But, it is the lesser knowns that enliven this CD- just wait til you hear, BK.Kris Kristofferson opens "The Pilgrim: A Celebration of Kris Kristofferson with an old intro to "The Pilgrim", which blends into the Emmylou Harris and friends' renditionWillie Nelson's interpretation of the spiritual song "The Legend "is the best there is.Emmylou Harris starts the CD off with her sweet rendition of "The Palm: Cheaper 33"".Roseanne Cash gives a soulful version "Lovin Him Was Easier".Rodney Crowell's "Come Sundown" is first rate.It is the other singers, who are lesser known who are standouts.Shooter Jennings sings "The Silver Tongued Devil" with flair.Randy Scruggs plays an instrumental of "Smile At Me Again".Todd Snider gives a gospel interpretation of those who find fault with friends in need of understanding in "Maybe You Heard".Marshall Chapman sings "Jesus Was A Capricorn" with a smile in her heart.Patty Griffin and Charanga Cakewalk take the political "Sandinista" and turn it into a personal plea for freedom.Shawn Camp's "Why Me" would make even an agnostic a true believer.Gretchen Wilson portrays life the day after with a mournful sound on "Sunday Morning Comin' Down."Russell Crowe is the biggest surprise. He tells the story of a man preoccupied with his work and material goods who loses it all when he discovers his wife has been unfaithful on "Darby's Castle". Crowe lets the tension build by singing the lyrics clear and straight and letting the words do the work.Brian McKnight sings a soulful version of "Me and Bobby McGee" that shows the sadness of this marvelous song.Bruce Robison and Kelly Willis, husband and wife, sing "Help Me Make it Through the Night." They sing the song of seduction with a country feel.Kris Kristofferson ends the CD with "Please Don't Tell Me How The Story Ends". This song functions well as a conclusion and also serves as pleasant reminder of the man behind the music.This is a CD to remember and to play as a reminder of the marvelous talented song writer, Kris Kristofferson. Highly Recommended. prisrob 07-11-06

These are goofy, indulgent, purposefully repetitive psychedelic grooves, music to space out to and enjoy. The End. If that sounds good to you, pick this album up and see what you think. Leave the fanboy "they rock" vs. "they suck" debates to the teenagers, indie nerds and would-be giantkillers who have too much time on their hands and think they have to prove themselves everytime a popular record comes along.

review/text: Who is Francois Pignon?He is a character that Francis Veber has used in many of his films, from La Chevre to the excellent Diner Des Cons, and he appears again in his latest Le Placard/The Closet.Pignon is always a lonely man, separated or divorced, with no friends or social life,accident prone,in short down on his luck, an average man living a dull existence, and invariably an oddity in a society that applauds people with good looks, and success professionally and socially..The very type of people that look down at Pignon and make fun of him..Hero vs anti Hero.This is Francois Pignon and Veber's character in the films should be looked at in this context, regardless if one film is funnier than the other.Certainly Diner Des Cons is funnier than Closet, and if you expect the same laughs then you will look at Veber's latest with less enthusiasm, and appreciate it less. Veber did not intend to repeat the same formula he used in Diner Des Cons, but give us a story about another Pignon, in a different context and situation.There is more poignancy in the Closet,and it is a bittersweet comedy, like the French can only make.The pretext of pretentious gayness to keep his job, is only a backdrop to Pignon's predicament at the hand of society, but it is a very clever insight nevertheless, into the corporate atmosphere and political correctness vs homophobia.Yet what I found very interesting about the gay angle, is how Pignon discovers a strenght and confidence he never thought he had by pretending to be gay.The way his colleagues and family react to him, from ridicule, to excessive friendliness, to pride, (from his own son, thinking it is very cool), is very interesting.The acting I though was very good. Assembling some of the best French working actors today , including Depardieu, Rochefort, Lhermitte and of course Auteuil.He plays Pignon in a straight faced manner..but not boring as some reviewer saw it, because his performance reflects so well the character he is playing. All Pignons are boring! Whereas in Diner Des Cons, Pignon had the gift of talking! even in the wrong moments, saying the wrong things, and entertaining the viewer in the process, Pignon of Closet had deep anxieties, and he shows them.The beauty about Francois Pignon is that he triumphs at the end. He saves the day..manages to make people happy, or clear the mess he put himself or others in, becoming the most unlikely hero. and this is Veber's triumph and with it The Closet.It is a wonderful film, that I hope Hollywood will not remake, because all Veber's american remakes,(Three Fugitives, The Toy, Birdcage) even the ones he directed himself, lose their magic,the magic of Francois Pignon.

review/text: Return Of The Killer Tomatoes is a film about many things. Product placement, TV news, big breasted babes in bikinis, Michael Jackson, Miami Vice, the Pope, scams, peanut butter on pizza and many other fads of the 80's. Starring such greats as George Clooney, John Astin and, of course, Karen Mistal (who has the best bottom of any B-movie actress I have ever seen) this is NOT as funny as the first but still has a ton of laughs within its many scenes.But under all the humor is a serious view about how people felt about the last, closing years of the Cold War against Communism. In a time when the Red Menace was seen as giant ants or aliens from space the director was brave enough to show that not all Communists, who were represented by the tomatoes, were bad. Chad, the always confused main male character, falls in love with Tara, a tomato-woman(but then who won't fall in love with a smart, willing, good cooking, great dressing tomato?). And FT, played by FT,(who as we all know become a huge star in the film industry as while as live theater in Europe), starred as the socialist with a heart of gold, who was even willing to put his own life in danger for the American way of life. THIS is a B-MOVIE to beat all B-movies. And remember, Tomorrow IS another day!

review/text: Rereading the Dharma Bums after probably a ten-year hiatus, I am struck by how foreign the beatniks seem to us today and how that impression must have been magnified tenfold for the Leave It To Beaver folks whom we are told ran the country back in the fifties. Then again Ray, Kerouac's protagonist, hitchhiked back and forth across America and found a surprising degree of tolerance if not admiration from the people stopping to give him a ride. Maybe that's just the nature of people on the move or maybe America wasn't really 100% homogenous like the beats and the flower children who followed them claimed.It would do "the kids today" good to read this book. I'll wager at least half of them won't get past the poetic language with which Kerouac writes his alleged prose. For the texting generation, Kerouac might as well be Shakespeare. A quick read fails to fully appreciate the music in his words. Slow down and enjoy.For those willing to embrace this new language, a world governed by thought, belief, emotion, experience, appreciation for nature and attention to basic human needs is unveiled; a world plunked down in the midst of the newborn consumer-driven American society governed by brands, advertising, the lure of "convenience," and the first hesitant salvos of pop culture. Kerouac's characters are as well-versed in Buddhism as the Middle America folks they meet are fluent in Christianity. For an introduction to American Zen Buddhism as it emerged in the beat culture of the fifties and early sixties, read Alan Watt's The Way of ZenThe Way of Zenand then read The Dharma Bums, looking up and studying every reference to Buddhism you don't understand. It's on my list of things to do, along with hiking to Desolation Peak. If you ever listened to the Doors and didn't understand why Jim Morrison sang "the West is the best," read The Dharma Bums and then Steinbeck's Cannery RowCannery Row: (Centennial Edition), and you'll begin to see, if not agree. It wouldn't have broken my heart if the last half of the book had been devoted to Ray's two months on Desolation Peak instead of just the last ten pages, but his adventures hitch-hiking, sitting in his family's woods, sleeping beneath the stars and eucalyptus trees, and riding the rails on the Midnight Ghost are worth every page devoted to them.Only Shot At A Good Tombstone

review/text: This DVD is in my library of Great films because it was entertaining but at the same time had a moral I'd like my son to understand.It was comedic in its dealing with the theme of the decades of the 60's and the 70's ( and even today) yet at the same time dealt seriously and respectfully with the topic.There was one theme, of a group's search for recognition of humanity and inalienable rights in the story of a young woman who kills her husband for her freedom and a younger Black man who gives his life in a similar cause. The two ongoing stories were handled in a unique and entertaining manner.I will watch this DVD over again and enjoy it many times in the future. I will watch for other films directed by Antonio Banderas.

review/text: Dudley Moore plays a famous conductor recently wed to a young and beautiful European actress played by Nastassja Kinski. It is a good relationship and the couple loves each other until a misunderstanding leads to suspicion on Moore's part. He comes to believe his beautiful child bride is playing around. Worse, he thinks she is playing around with his prot?g?, a notorious womanizer. Its untrue but coincidences mount up to reinforce the idea until he is blind with rage and plots both of their murders.It sound very serious thus far but remember that the jealous husband is played by Dudley Moore. That means that this is a comedy as he puts his plot into action with Moore's typically inept style. Nothing goes as planned and each instance is usually good for a few laughs.This film was NOT as funny as I remembered it being when I was a kid but I did laugh and I did enjoy it. Particularly effective is the use of classical music to set the mood throughout. Often, the pieces used are familiar and even stereotypical but that does not stop them from being appropriate or well chosen.

review/text: I've read and reviewed the three previous books in Jay Beale's Open Source Security Series -- Snort 2.1, Nessus Network Auditing, and Ethereal Packet Sniffing. I liked all three of those books, and I'm glad to say that this fourth book -- Nessus, Snort, and Ethereal Power Tools (NSAEPT), is a worthy continuation of Jay's series. NSAEPT is a unique resource for anyone who wants to extend Nessus, Snort, and Ethereal. The book could save programmers hours of work, and it should be the first step for those looking to contribute to the development of all three projects.It's unfortunate that an uninformed three star review has been the only commentary on NSAEPT until now. Of course the book is not for beginners! Why write another introductory book, when the three earlier titles serve that role (and more)? NSAEPT is strong precisely because it starts where the other three books end.I learned quite a bit reading NSAEPT. For example, Part I shared advice on using Nessus to audit hosts directly, by examining Windows registry keys, package databases, or Windows PE files (.exe, .dll) directly. I appreciated the discussion of creating NASL checks that were more protocol-aware (for MySQL) or that could speak NTLM authentication to IIS Web servers. Ch 6 even gave tips on building NASL generators.Part II, covering Snort, gave better advice on writing Snort rules than what was found in the earlier Snort 2.1 book. I thought this part was the weakest of the three, however. I would have liked to have seen many more examples of using advanced Snort rule options. Table 8.10 should have said that the + flag means "match on the specified flags, and allow any other flags." Also, I thought the author miscommunicated the purpose of the stream4 preprocessor when he mentioned dropping UDP and ICMP traffic. That's an issue when running inline, not passively as most people use Snort.I really liked Part III, which examined Ethereal. Ch 11 offered great guidance on reverse engineering an unknown trace format, namely iptrace from AIX 3. Ch 12 mentioned an undocumented tethereal flag (-G) that was new to me. I enjoyed learning about tap modules in Ch 13, and I did not know that Ethereal uses the wiretap library to read traces -- not libpcap.I subtracted one star from my review for a few reasons. First, NSAEPT features some really annoying formatting problems in many of the code listings. Every place the characters "FI" (any case) appear, they are changed into a single nonsensical character. I stopped counting the number of times this happened. For example, where one should read "Filename", we see instead "Xlename". The same seems to have happened with "FL"; e.g., "Flags" becomes "Xags". The reference to libpcap and "Chapter 1" on p 159 should instead point to Ch 11. I thought the inclusion of material from Brian Wotring's Host Integrity Monitoring book as Appendix A was unnecessary. Brian's book is great, but I don't think readers need 30 pages from another title. Is that just padding?Format-wise, NSAEPT features smaller fonts than one sees in more recent Syngress books. I thought the font was a little small, but in some ways an improvement over the jumbo text seen elsewhere. I also thought the paper used to print NSAEPT was much better than other titles. Compare NSAEPT with another 440 page Syngress book, Securing IM and P2P Applications for the Enterprise, and you'll see the latter book is much thicker.Overall I recommend NSAEPT to anyone who wishes to do more with Nessus, Snort, or Ethereal. NSAEPT is definitely a book for power users and developers. It's great to see a new book that starts with original material and avoids rehashing what's already been written.

review/text: I never thought I would get bored of watching giant robots fight one another, but I did.I had ready plenty of reviews that said this was the best Transformers movie ever or at least that it was better then the last one. Frankly, I am not sure what is different in this one that than the last one (2nd). I will state: I never watched the cartoon; I really enjoyed the first movie. The story had a pretty good setup, but by the end I didn't care and just wanted the movie to be over.The video quality on the disc is top-notch and the 7.1 sound was terrific on my 120" scope/ 7.1 system. I always like to see the subtitles in the picture (due to my constant in height setup). I heard great directionality. I saw no artifacts or any video problems. Could easily be a demo disc for sound and audio.As far as extras, this disc has none (probably why the video looks so good from a compression standpoint). I can't seem to find time to watch all of the movies I want to, much less the extras.I will be very wary before I spend more money on this franchise in the future.

Found this one (Empire Level 2784 Vernier Caliper, 4-3/4) on Amazon, but other than an OK accuracy, all left are cons: the edges are very sharp; the sliding part is super tight; the scale markings are not clear; the finish is probably the lowest quality you would expect from a caliper, it looks dark/gray as if it were taken out in the middle of production line. After an hour or so taking the caliper all apart, sanding and tension reducing (2 little spring plates), it's now look and feel like a normal caliper; without this self-adjusting, this item is hard and unsafe to use.

review/text: This book is an expanded version of the author's first book, originally titled _A Millionaire's Secret Investment Strategy_.This book is part expos&eacute; (about 30%) and part technique (70%).It explains how the author made his million (in real dollars, not in market value) actually investing (not writing about investing, not by commissions, and not by salary from a mutual fund company). That background separates the author from about 99% of all other authors who write about the stock market.It's defintely an eye-opener book. The technique or strategy presented is almost a &quot;why didn't I think of that?&quot; kind of strategy. Basically, the idea is to run your portfolio the same way you would run a business. It's not a get-rich-quick kind of plan, but because stock market investing is a compounding activity (the more you make the more you can invest), you can grow geometrically instead of linearly.The other nice feature of this strategy is that it requires a minimal amount of analysis compared to many others that I've seen. You just focus on the essential measures of quality (and they are essential).Be warned though: every business has it's good and bad times. Sometimes your portfolio will very profitable, but other times the profits may be slow in coming. It's the nature of almost all businesses. The key is to maintain your plan during the slow times and reign in your greed during the boom times.

review/text: It's been nearly a year since I saw 'The Piano Teacher', but I still have the images in my mind, still sharp, still intense, still somewhat disturbing. But, I like it that way. Heineke's film, is definitely one of the biggest rises in French film industry. And I agree with the other reviewers, that the film's unknownness is directly related to its unconventional tension, which literally made me scratch my seat in the theater.The film focuses on Isabelle Huppert's sexual and social psychosis, and her isolation from the rest of the society. During the course of the movie, Huppert goes through a couple of sexual explosions, which are not at a pleasing nor satisfying level at all, but rather resulting in discontent and hatred among her and her partner, who is the student she gives piano lessons to. This after-scene suffices for you to feel odd. Her sexual inmaturity, gives rise to her weird behavior during daily life. Her seclusion of her own mother, that precedes her real harrassment of her, is a good example of this idea.This film involves severe tension, sexual and social violence. Beware of this fact before you purchase the film. It's a brilliant film, but for some people. Some may not like the content. Great production by Heineke, great acting by Isabelle Hupport!

review/text: Alright, there are no special features. Alright, so there aren't even any subtitles. And there are a couple of seconds where the picture had grain- ok, I give. But overall, this film is excellently presented. I don't have any complaints about the sound or the picture- in fact, I thought it was remarkably clear considering that it hasn't been preserved as well as a lot of other pictures. Trust me, the plot more than makes up for any minor annoyances.In an Oscar nominated performance, Joan Crawford plays successful playwright Myra Hudson. When she falls in love with a handsome actor named Lester (played by Jack Palance, nominated for Best Supporting Actor) everything seems perfect. But when she discovers her husband's plot to murder her, she designs a plan to reverse the gun.This movie is great, and if you're not one of those people who whine when they don't get all the bells and whistles, you'll love it too.

review/text: I needed to replace a previous InSinkErator H990 instant hot water dispenser installed in our kitchen sink. I was not pleased that the prior model had failed in about three years time but decided to replace it with the newer model from InSinkErator. I was impressed with the design change that replaced a formerly plastic heating tank with a much more durable stainless steel tank. Also, I liked being able to keep the old faucet component and still hook up the new tank. The backward compatibility was a nice touch and can save installation time. I also like the new temperature setting large knob which replaced the old metal cover hiding the temperature adjustment.Don't set the temperature too high or there is a lot of spitting and girgling at the end of each heating cycle.The installation had no surprises and I was delighted enough to buy the same unit for my daughter and her husband and installed it over Thanksgiving holiday up in Boise. The unit is ideal for making single cups of tea or getting a head start on boiling water on the stove. The new larger tank 1/2 gallon vs. 1/3 allows more cups to be drawn in a short period of time.

review/text: Rollerball still stands as a solid sci-fi flick about the fear of corporate society and the crushing of the little guy (you). Sadly, if you look around, we're slowly approaching it.Fast forward to now and we have yet another remake. With Rollerball (2002) I am now convinced that these remakes serve a functional purpose: to make the originals look like masterpieces. If there is another reason, I've yet to see it. At this point, I would be less insulted if Hollywood studios publicly declared: We have no ideas, we are bankrupt of original thoughts, so we'll just resell you the same thing, over and over.The sickest thing about John McTiernan's Rollerball remake is that it had potential. The original film took place in a sterilized future world where corporations had taken the place of nations, society had everything it needed, and the main distraction for the pesty public was the ultraviolent sport of rollerball. Jonathan E began to meddle by somehow surviving the sport year after year and began to shine, which is exactly what the corporations did NOT want. The sport was to prove the futility of individual effort.In the remake, the setting is the near future, but the concerns are not global like the original. Rollerball is more a fringe sport (like Slamball, or Arena Football, or backyard wrestling) operating out of central Asia (any of the '-stan' countries of the old Soviet empire.) For the miserable masses who slave in mines, the sport, which is less coherent here than the original film, provides a distraction from their meaningless lives (sort of like all sports do, anyway.)I did like this idea for the setting, making rollerball a regional interest rather than global phenomenon. It actually makes it more realistic, and indeed there are references to WWE wrestling, which it resembles in the glitzy pageantry and shameless profiteering. This, along with other elements, are wasted in the ensuing chaos.An NHL draftee (Chris Klein, doing a career Keanu impersonation that is frightening) flees the USA because he's been busy illegally body-boarding down San Fran streets and runs off with LL Cool J to play for big money in the rollerball leauge. The (naturally) evil team owner is Jean Reno, who covets more and more ratings by getting rid of rules, penalties, and other pesty elements of the sport that prevent people from dying. This is all to satisfy some kind of global ratings meter that is instant and will gauge who is tuning in when.I could go on and on about this film. It was famously plagued during post-production (not to mention pre-production, production, and the 'idea', casting, and all other phases.) The film is incoherent, plain and simple. What you would call a mess.It is highly recommended to bad movie buffs the world over. I picked this baby up at a 2-for-$15 sale--that's less than the cost of seeing this clinker in the theater! The DVD wisely throws in many extras to entice you and to give you something approaching value after you realize how appalling the film is.The other recommendation is to buy the original Rollerball on DVD, also a good value.I now heartily endorse remakes like this one, as I'm sure Norman Jewison (director of the original) does. His film and his career shine that much brighter after atrocities like this.

review/text: "Rebus Set 3," as seen on BBC America, is newly-released. It was made by Britain's Independent Television (ITV), although it's being seen on the BBC channel on these shores. Like the others in this superb series, it's a police procedural excellently filmed in Edinburgh, though not the bits of it with which tourists are familiar. Furthermore, scenes, whether on the streets or in the police station, are crowded with people and cars, of correct-looking vintage, rushing around. The people have also apparently been encouraged to speak in the local dialect, which adds immeasurably to the engrossing "foreign" flavor of these productions; although the dialog might be impenetrable to those of us on these shores without the unadvertised subtitles thoughtfully provided by Acorn. The series is, of course, based on the Inspector Rebus novels, also set in Edinburgh, written by prize-winning, best selling Scottish author Ian Rankin. He's tipped by such of his colleagues as best-selling American crime novelist James Ellroy, as the progenitor and #1 practitioner of "tartan noir,"the Scottish adaptation of noir fiction: bloodier and more bloody-minded than the usual, boasting that scorching Scottish humor.This series features four more taut offerings from the hit British series of crime thrillers, including "Resurrection Men," based on the Edgar-Award for Best Novel-winning book of the same name; and "The Naming of the Dead," based on the book of the same name that won the British Book Award for Crime Thriller of the Year. Also"Knots and Crosses," based on an earlier book, the first Rebus novel, published in 1987 to great critical acclaim. And "The First Stone," apparently an original screenplay using Rankin's characters.These characters continue to be played by the excellent cast assembled for post-John Hannah productions: admired television actor Ken Stott, man of a thousand faces, in the title role, that of Detective Inspector Rebus. Claire Price as his earnest, ambitious partner Detective Sergeant Siobhan Clarke. And Jennifer Black as Detective Chief Superintendent Gillian Templer, Rebus's boss, and one of his many former lovers. Black's character appears to have beefed-up parts in this series -- and good for her -- though it looks to me as if she and Price are having trouble with the wardrobe department: the ones they've been given are dowdy, and quite meager. It's a good thing they're not making "Sex and the City.""Resurrection Men" has been just about totally rewritten from the book; that's probably just as well; as many people complained the latter was confusing. "The First Stone," an original script, is a riveting, gutsy attack on the Church of Scotland. "The Naming of the Dead" has also been largely rewritten from the book; also, undoubtedly, just as well, as many readers complained about that book,too. Finally," Knots and Crosses" is excellently done. It features actor Nicholas Farrell, who's virtually grown-up on TV and movie screens before us, as its villain.In "The First Stone," when Templer is asked how she sleeps at night, with the things she's been forced to see as a cop, she answers, "a wee dram." If you're watching this exciting series at night, you just might need similar help.

review/text: This is the second of the three novels in the original "Foundation Trilogy", which was published in 1952 by Gnome Press. An edited version of it was published by Ace Books in the 1950s under the title "The Man Who Upset The Universe". It consists of two sections which are taken from shorter fiction that was published in "Astounding Science Fiction" in the 1940s. While better than the first novel in the series, there are still some weaknesses as a result of age. Asimov himself wrote in 1982 that the knowledge of astronomy at that time was "primitive" and that he could now take advantage of electronic computers in his stories, which hadn't been invented until he was halfway through the series in the 40s.The two sections of "Foundation And Empire" are:"The General" - In this story, the Foundation is attacked by what is left of the Empire. The Empire, though much weaker than it once was, is still stronger than the Foundation. This was first published as the novelette "Dead Hand" in the April 1945 edition of "Astounding Science Fiction"."The Mule" - Perhaps the best of the Foundation stories; in this one the Seldon plan is destroyed by its inability to predict a singular event. The Foundation is threatened by a person known only as The Mule. He is mysteriously able to defeat more powerful forces, with inferior forces. This was first published as the novella "The Mule" in "Astounding Science Fiction" in November and December of 1945.The trilogy has been recognized by readers and critics alike over the years. In 1952, it was rated as the 15th best book overall by the Astounding/Analog All-Time Poll. It moved up to 12th on the same poll in 1956, and then to 1st in 1966. In 1975 it was ranked 6th on the Locus poll for All-Time Novels. In 1987 it was 6th on the same poll for SF Novels. In 1998 it was ranked 4th on the same poll for novels before 1990. It also received the 1966 Hugo for All-Time Series, beating out Tolkien's "The Lord Of The Rings", Smith's "Lensman", Heinlein's "Future History", and Burroughs' "Barsoom" series for the award.

What i can claim is that upon listening to this stunning piece of work, i was awestruck by it's natural and organic beauty. No studio trickery here folks, just raw musical talent, coupled with dolly's magical voice and charm.When listening to this remarkable album, you will honestly feel like you have been transported to some smokey mountain. The music is that rich, and lyrically, it is beyond exceptional. Dolly is a story-teller, and when she sings a verse or chorus, you believe every word of it.In short, leave pre-coneptions behind, and you will find a definitive materpiece within the covers of this album.As a side note, Dolly's cover of 'Silver dagger' might just be the greatest recording of her career. I have never heard song which is as compellingly haunting as this is. Dolly's haunting delivery of the lyrics will give you chills, and is easily the most beautifully crafted song on the album. Pure perfection, and worthy of the price of this cd alone!

review/text: Like other novels by Thomas Hardy, this is a beautiful and densely written work; I have read several of his other novels, but it is the character of Tess that sticks most in my mind. This is a tragic story, make no mistake, and as such it left a deep impression upon me. Numerous scenes and details linger in my memory, due to Hardy's rich prose style - the terrible death of the Durbeyfield horse; the texture of Tess's cheek, unwillingly yielded for Alec to kiss (as "damp and smoothly chill as the skin on the mushrooms in the fields around"); Tess's humane execution of mutilated pheasants, preyed upon by careless hunters. I could go on...but then half of the pleasure of reading is a sense of discovery, so I shall end there.Hardy's usual pastoral idyll is present here (in the form of Talbothays and eloquent descriptions of the bounties of spring), but this is thrown into powerful contrast by the increasingly bleak events that overtake the hopeless Tess as she progresses.I recommend it for any reader willing to try 19th century novels, and particularly fans of Eliot - Hardy was of a proto-feminist persuasion, like Eliot, but I think he writes with even more emotional power. It is interesting to observe that modern male writers seem relatively unconcerned with creating such singularly memorable female characters, although Hardy was admittedly an oddity of his era.If you have struggled to get beyond the first few chapters - as I initially did - I found that a total-immersion policy helped; the intensity of the denoument means that this is a book best read over a short time. I grew so attached to the characters and settings of the novel that I felt lost when I finished reading it.If you have read this and relished Hardy's fatalistic approach as much as I did, then Jude the Obscure is definately worth reading.

It fails as a novel because there is no story to speak of, just a string of scenes to initiate discussion of the issues Lawrence wished to explore. Apologists describe it as picaresque, but there is far more unity to most novels that deserve that descriptor. Nonetheless, there are wonderful scenes that fitfully jar this book to life, Lawrence's admirable command of language, and a brooding homoeroticism aching to burst out. Try this book after you've hit the major works (i.e. Women in Love, etc.).

His countless accounts of the Men in Black and their games will inform you as to their place in all of this, frighten you and even make you laugh out loud. His work helps defend the theory that aliens are inter-dimensional rather than extra-terrestrial.Even if you are not a UFO buff, this is a smooth, yet thorough induction into this strange and all too close world. Even for you non-believers, the connections made in this book will at the very least gnaw at you and most definately entertain you.I've probably read over a hundred books on paranormal and UFOs and still have them. I found 'Alien Agenda' by Marrs and 'Alien Rapture by Fouche - Steiger to be my favorites, and I have read them more than once. Alien Rapture - The Chosen by Fouche is being made into a screen-play by a major studio in Burbank CA. Also see all the books by Jim Marrs.

review/text: Just brilliant color quality and great B&W.;When using photo paper you cannot see any pixelation! It's like having your own printing lab.Unlike my many epson printers in the past, there is also no degradation in quality over time (8 mths.)The one problem I had was that the printing unit inside was stuck when it arrived. It made an awful grinding sound when it tried to start up, so I had to call support (not toll free!!). They explained that I had to apply pressure to a certain area to free the unit. It was all a bit stressful and it eventually worked and I have had no problems since.The ink cartridges seem to last way longer than my epson ones did in the past. Just recently changed both (8 mths) with fairly regular use. I probably printed 50+ 4x6 glossies.I have not seen or tried any of the newer epsons, they may be be comparable in all respects. I have my doubts though....it worked flawlessly on my XP OS.

review/text: This is an outstanding collection of the best know shorter works by Steinbeck, or more accurately a collection of his novellas. The writing is exceptional and this is a highly recommended buy.The stories are short and they cannot be compared with his best known novel "Grapes of Wrath." But this is a superb collection containing his best short work and first novel "Of Mice and Men." Also, it contains "Cannery Row," another great story. And, it has his interesting novel "The Moon is Down." It is about resistance to an invading force. We can assume that it is probably Norway during World War II, and their resistance to Germany, but Steinbeck keeps it a bit vague which broadens the appeal of the book. It could apply to any invading force.John Steinbeck (1902 - 1968) was among the best known American writers of the 20th century. He won the 1962 Nobel Prize for literature. His 1939 Pulitzer Prize winning novel, "Grapes of Wrath" has over ten million copies in print.Steinbeck was born in rural California, went to Stanford, and spent most of his life in California. He has been associated with the plight of farm workers and others. His books have been very popular and many were made into movies and stage productions. He won an Academy Award nomination for best story in 1944.I have read a number of his novels and am still surprised with the quality of his work - especially his short stories and short novels, so the present collection is a great buy.The collection has his famous short works and is not a heavy read. Each of the works takes one evening to read. I liked all the stories. Readers will appreciate the clarity of the prose, the characters, and the messages. This is a great value purchase and an interesting reading experience.

review/text: Although I didn't purchase this movie through Amazon, I thought I'd enjoy having this Blu-ray combo pack. The movie is fun. Better in my opinion than I would have thought. The action is fast and the CG has come a long way in the short time between the first and third movies.My one complaint is that although, you get a combo pack with the DVD and a digital copy, you get no extra features. If I had known that, I'd have waited to purchase it at later date. I thought it was insulting to include a coupon for the 3D copy of the movie in the package itself.Will I purchase the next version with all the extras? No.Buyers who don't care for any extra features will be happy with this version. The transfer to Blu-ray is very good. Surround sound works great on a home theater system.The story is really only an excuse for the action. Don't think about it because there is very little plot. It's a fun popcorn movie but missing vital information for those interested in any of the background information.

review/text: Clay Aiken's frist CD is outstanding. It has a bit of everything on it- some rock, some pop, AC, jazzy and some Latin tones. I love every songs on it. He has a great voice and can sing almost any genre of music. My favorite is &quot;Measure of a Man&quot;, beautiful lyrics and showcase his voice very well. Another favorite is &quot;The Way&quot;, so sensual it sends chills up my veins. Also &quot;Touch&quot; is very sexy and has a good beat.I was so tired of most of the pop music out there so I am glad Clay brought back good music into my life.For those that like the Beatles, Elton John, Journey and soft rock oldies, this album is for you!

review/text: I have never owned a good set of cookware before purchasing the Anolon Advanced 10 pc. set. I had always owned the cheap $10-$15 per pan stuff you buy at Wal-Mart or similar stores. I was lucky and was able to find a deal on this cookware at Bed, Bath & Beyond for about $230. The choice was either Calphalon or the Anolon, and because I got the free knife and the great deal, the Anolon won out.My initial impression upon unpacking was that this stuff was very heavy. In fact, I noticed that even the 8" fry pan was heavier than my largest cheap pan from Wal-Mart. Once cleaning and reading the care instructions (who would figure you can't wash nonstick pans in the dishwasher??) I set out to create my culinary creations.One amazing aspect of these pans is that they take what seems like forever to heat up. I attribute this to the heavy and thick nature of the pans. Once heated up though, they hold heat well and have very even cooking across the entire surface, even well up into the sides. In using the covered pots, I also noticed that water boils more evenly than any pot I had owned up until now. I must say that the food came out better than ever. Clean up was also a breeze and with a little dishwashing liquid and a washcloth, every single thing on the pans wiped clean. (just like you see in the commercials that never seem to come true once you buy the product)One word of warning: if you stack pans, you need to use some heavy paper towels in between them as the edges can scratch other pans. I have been fortunate, but the heavy nature means you need to be careful. Still, if you buy thses pans, you won't regret the purchase.

I also like the intro to the game,and the muscic in each room before you restore it. I even reconized a bit of music from the movie! If you love Fantasy,dragons,and rapunzel you should get the movie-and this very fun game!(The movie is very nice,even though it is 4 years old!)And another thing-Barbie's mask is not a mask-it is just a feather in the air-have you seen it?

My new system is as follows: Tyan Trinity 510 MB(using the current via 4-in-1 drivers), Pent-4 1.8ghz(478 pin), Radeon 8500 of course, 256meg ddr pc2100 ram, WD 20 gig 7200 rpm hd, soundblaster pci 512 sound, antec full tower case w/300watt p/s, and the standard cd, ups, etc. My cooling of the system is provided by 1 cool slot fan, 3 80mm fans, and one pci slot exhaust fan under the radeon. After upgrading to this system and reinstalling the radeon with the current 6071 drivers I have a new found love for this card. Serious Sam SE plays like a dream and actually looks better than my GF4 MX card! Aliens vs. Predator 2-ditto. Word of advice, this card was designed for faster systems(1ghz and up) with the motherboards supporting 4x agp and fast writes. I think the new drivers ATI put out recently has helped also.

review/text: When John Coltrane recorded this album in 1964, he intended it to be a tribte to God; the record is an epic four-part suite, with each of its sections representing a stage in the struggle for spiritual unity with the supreme being. The music is full of passion and power, bulging with internal conflict and meditative grace. 'Trane's playing here is incredible- it's as lyrical as anything Miles Davis ever did, a virtuoso display of emotional resonance and controlled chaos. The rest of the players aren't so shabby themselves: The rhythm section of bassist Jimmy Garrison and drummer Elvin Jones lend the proceedings a surging, driving intensity, while pianist McCoy Tyner radiates angelic slabs of pure melody.Just listen to the band moving through those four sections! "Acknowledgement" wastes no time in setting the tone for the rest of the suite. It's a mini-masterpiece in and of itself, boiling over with passion and intensity. There's pain in Coltrane's playing, but there's also hope and power- he shoots forth whirlwinds of pure, goreous sound, filling the room with pure electricified magic. "Resolution" builds on the template set by "Acknowledgement," which sees the band improvising on a rugged, bluesy theme. This section has an almost film-noir feel to it, thanks to the heavy tension in Coltrane's playing. Next up is the harrowing "Pursuance," which features a volcanic drum solo from Jones. The heavenly, meditative "Psalm" is an ideal conlusion to the record.Simply put, this is one of the greatest albums (jazz or otherwise) ever recorded. No collection is complete without it.

review/text: First off, this book is a fascinating read - John Douglas has taken some of the most fascinating cases in crime history, and offered compelling arguments and evidence for, or against, the accuseds in each case. I love true-crime books, and this one is very interesting, with its descriptions of what evidence the authorities had to work with.But on the other hand; it's when he goes off on one of his tangents; that if the authorities had done "this, this, and this", and if he had been around to have his hand in the older cases, he would have had the cases locked up. It's easy to criticize from a distance of years; but I'll bet there were quite a few competent investigators on the case, who did the best they could with what they had at the time.The author's shameless patting himself on the back in his books is incredibly annoying, to the point where I just fast-forward past it to the objective parts.

This book is enthralling for many reasons- it's amazing what people will do while under the influence of someone else and even more amazing how religion is usually twisted into everything, whether good or bad. Shows how easily fairly intelligent people can be brainwashed into thinking and doing things most would never consider. Fascinating, appalling, and unbelieveable all rolled into one.

review/text: Miserable Keanu Reeves film that is one of the worst movies ever made. Keanu is more than miscast in this film, he makes the film a real chore to watch with his horrible acting and lousy delivery of his lines. This is not his fault because he can be a good actor when he has the right material but he's not working with a full deck here and he's as bad as the film itself. The rest of the film is as bad as he is with a story that makes no sense and direction by music director who does not know the hell he is doing with the movie he's making. Some plot points go no where in terms of furthering the story a long and certain revelations don't makes any sense at all with the overall story. The special effects are not handled well and you really can't see much of the movie at all with how dark it is. Only Rachel Weisz and Peter Stormare do well with what they got and they both make this film bearable with their better than the script performances. Weisz deserves all the praise she is getting for her performance, and that's really because she's does give a better performance than the movie as a whole and Stormare does well with his ten minute cameo and does a better job with his role than most of the actors in the entire film.Now I have not read the comic book on which this film is based on but I hope it's a hell of a lot better than this lousy film.

review/text: Weak quality throughout. Even the cover art is clearly printed out on a computer printer, similar to what a good CD-R bootleg looks like. Perhaps that's the point - this album was rejected by a record label in the early '90s. Therefore, you should consider this a collection of Demos. Weak ones too...What I loved about Shriekback was the groove and the constant edgy vibe, like mysterious sex in dark passionate places. That sounds ridiculous of course, but Shriekback made it work - their best was just that sensual and weird. 1992's 'Sacred City' was a patchy comedown from 'Big Night Music' or 'Oil &amp; Gold', but the best moments captured the Shriekback vibe perfectly. You should check out 'Sacred City'....You can ignore this CD. I'm amazed how flat &amp; disjointed it sounds. Don't be misled - 7 of these 14 tracks are under 2 minutes, just instrumental jams caught on tape. They don't buffer the real songs well, and are completely dismissable. (They do make the album appear longer though.) The recording budget was clearly small, the studio time limited as well. On the positive side, there's a lot of unusual stringed instruments and ethnic percussion you don't hear on most records. That definitely helps, but Eh. &quot;UnSong&quot; is sly and works perfectly - this strong song will hold up well on any 'Greatest Hits' package. It makes the rest of the CD seem even slighter. Shame on you &quot;UnSong&quot;!Oh cruel fate. I'm resigned to the fact a unique '80s band that was great so often will soon be forgotten. 'Naked Apes &amp; Pond Life' won't help Shriekback's cause in the slightest. Sadly, I'll bet it's the last I hear from them. (Please prove me wrong, guys.)

review/text: I first heard Nik Kershaw's 15 Minutes CD at a listening station at a record store when it first came out. I am not a big fan of his, but I remember him from the early/mid 1980s and was interested in what he was doing currently. Boy, was I surprised. The first track is unbelievably catchy. The chorus is wonderful. "Have a Nice Life" is nice in a sing-along sort of way. "Find Me an Angel" is hauntingly beautiful. "Your Brave Face" is an addictive rocker. "What Do You Think of It So Far?" has one of the best choruses I've heard in a long time. "God Bless" is a different-sounding song with some interesting, and strangely familiar, guitar work. "Fiction" is a pleasant, slow number with more nice acoustic guitar and lyrics like: "If they made a film of the book of the memory with Bobby De Niro and Demi De Moore, you'd sit in your seat with your popcorn and chocolate, and wonder aloud at the point of it all." The heavy sounding chorus to "Made in Heaven" makes the song. "Shine On" is adequate but "15 Minutes" is an excellent ending, I especially like the synthesizer/orchestra part. Almost every track here is excellent. The only track I do not care for as much is "Billy" which seems like overly forced story-telling about a girl looking for Mr. Right and falls for a boy wanting numerous Mrs. Rights. It is cute, though, and I think a lot of people will like it.As one might guess, I bought this CD right after leaving the listening station, and only when I got home to listen to it on my stereo did I discover that this CD does not end with "15 Minutes" but includes a bonus remake of Kershaw's early 1980s hit "Wouldn't It Be Good." I was very happy to hear this song, as it was the track I most remember from Nik Kershaw's 1980s output. It is slower rendition of the song with acoustic guitar. It is not as good as the original, of course, but it was still a welcomed surprise. 13 quality tracks! I would not be surprised if Kershaw's most devoted fans call 15 Minutes his best album.

review/text: Welcome to Hammer's outstanding &quot;Hands of the Ripper&quot;, one of the studio's last movies and one of their best. The story tells of Anna, a young girl who is actually Jack the Ripper's daughter, and who was traumatised as a toddler by witnessing a vicious killing (seen in the prologue). Now an adult, she is prone to murderous seizures which provide the many grisly highlights of the film. It sounds rather lurid, but the film takes the subject seriously, and as a whole, the plot is tremendously engaging. Anna's rages are only triggered by a specific set of circumstances, and the script creates a surprising and clever staging for each one, following on every time with a suitably gory slaughter. The film features great performances from its prestigious cast, particularly Angharad Rees who is luminously beautiful as Anna, and Eric Porter as the doctor who realises her identity but is compelled to try and cure her rather than turn her in (as well as falling for her charms, as she has no recollection of what she does when she goes into a trance). Of course, in the movies such a situation can only end in tragedy, and the climax of the story is elegantly downbeat and very effective. The period London setting, the photography and the directing all fall perfectly into place, and &quot;Hands of the Ripper&quot; can be judged as one of Hammer's greatest acheivements. It's crying out for a DVD release, so hopefully someone will take the initiative very soon. There is a UK region 2 release, but it's only available as a box set with two far inferior British 70's horror movies &quot;The Monster&quot; and &quot;The Uncanny&quot;. I was lucky and got one from a split set, but it's a real shame that most people will miss out on enjoying this movie by it not getting the circulation it deserves.

review/text: Run Lola Run is a supercharged, ultra-kinetic roller-coaster ride that twists, turns, and boggles the mind with its remarkable profoundness! Lola is a shocking redheaded punk with a memorable scream, and the film all starts out with a really frantic phone call from Lola's boyfriend, Manni. He needs to deliver 100,000 German marks to his mobster boss Ronni in 20 minutes, or he will die a most definite death. From then on, Lola literally races time in three separate scenarios to save Manni's life, so the movie basically ends three times. Although this movie looks all rock-video, MTV-style from the outside, it actually has a profound message behind its unusual exterior. Plus it's got one of the most heart-racing soundtracks I've heard in a long time. This is probably my favorite movie--next to The Matrix, of course!Rated R, but it doesn't deserve to be. It has a few profanities, some violence, and a couple non-explicit discussions about sex. But that's it. This movie will appeal most to people between the ages of 12 and 25. It also often looks or sounds too weird for people to be interested in it, or they just scoff at the fact that it's in German with English subtitles. But you have to look beyond that in order to appreciate this movie. If you rated it less than 5 stars, you only looked at the outside, and in the third scenario, you were just too dizzified or disappointed to really see what finally happened. But you can still believe whatever you want.

review/text: I've had shirts custom tailored for me while overseas, often with fine, imported fabric. These shirts, stitched in Vietnam, rival the best custom shirts. The collars are extremely clean looking, and lay down well. The 'tonal diagonal' fabric has subtle darker pistripes every 1/16" and, every 3/4", a diagonal angled row of slightly raised, slightly lighter stitches. Hard to describe! But from mirror distance it is highly professional, not too showy look. Also comfortable looking, as well as to wear. I also like the long tail of the shirt to prevent pull outs. I am on line today to order several more of each. I prefer the tonal diagonal myselfbut presume that fabric and tailoring are of similar quality across the line.(The French cuff variety if this shirt is a real bargain. I recently paid $80 for a similar shirt, and am not highly impressed with the fabric. The 60-40 blend makes the shirt relax a bit more than the all-cottons one I have. )

review/text: Terrible adaptation of the great comic book "Hellblazer" is nothing short of a spit in the eye of the fans of the comic book with a terrible and down right crude performance by Keanu Reeves, who makes a joke out of one of the most beloved cult comic book characters made in the last twenty years. His performance is bad to the point of wanting to throw something at the screen just out of sheer rage. The screenplay is a joke and the dialog rages from bad to much worse as the movie progresses and the special effects are so badly done that the monsters would have been better off if they were puppets instead. Some of the actors in the film are better than the film itself with great performances by Rachel Weisz, who is the only ray of light this movie really has and Djimon Hounsou, who is the only actor who does his comic book character any justice. Despite Rachel Weisz, the movie is bad and not even her talent could have saved it.

Initially I was impressed by the ESPN features and definitely floored by the depth of the user options, GM choices, etc. The gameplay is smooth, the offensive and defensive strategies and plays are incredibly fluid and the true hockey fanatic with seasoned experience will really be able to get the most out of this game.The graphics off-the-ice are impressive, the players faces are also top shelf but the game play graphics aren't as fluid as EA's and the moves aren't as realistic. You can't have it all... you can tell just by the size of the manual that more thought went into NHL2K3 and their first attempt at hockey on the PS2 is definitely a sign to watch out EA, because SEGA has your number. I enjoyed the fact that there weren't all gimmicks like NHL cards, cheat options and choose your own celebration. All this including gamebreaker and dynamic dekes are [bad]. Anyway who knows and follows hockey is acutely aware that you have to play 60 minutes (or 15) to win. NHL2K3 does it self a favor by putting all its flavor on the ice and the ESPN brand helps the whole game's realism. If only EA could learn from this.A CBC Hockey Night in Canada graphic environment would probably take NHL2K3 to even better heights, maybe for next year. ESPN's dedication to hockey is definitely falling off due to their acquisition of the NBA.

review/text: When I got this album I was a fairly cocky &quot;guitar nerd&quot; type who loved imitating the likes of Joe Satriani and Steve Vai. A friend told me that John Coltrane had been an influence on Jimi Hendrix, who had of course been a big influence on my heroes. Well, I have to say this music did it for me in a big way. It helped me to see that technique did not necessarily have to lead to aimless flaunting and big, bad hairdo's (the all too obvious problem with most instrumental rock). Still, the beauty of the album took a while to grow on me. I was cocky enough to mistake &quot;out&quot; notes for bad notes. I simply thought the guy didn't know his scales. Still, I liked it. It had soul and it wasn't afraid to take itself seriously. In fact A Love Supreme would easily top any poll regarding &quot;serious soulfulness&quot; in a jazz recording. The lesson, I guess, is that great music is not created to be deconstructed, but rather to be enjoyed. Let this album wash through you (not over) and you'll feel some very nice effects.

review/text: In this uniformly clear and incisive volume (the third in Brand Blanshard's landmark trilogy in defense of reason), the twentieth century's greatest philosophical rationalist carefully examines the claims of religion in the light of reason (including its claims that something other than reason may provide an ultimate standard of truth). Entering sympathetically but critically into the thought of great religious thinkers in the Roman Catholic and Protestant traditions, Blanshard concludes that whatever legitimate content religion may have, the claims of reason as ultimate arbiter of truth cannot be compromised.This conclusion does _not_, Blanshard insists, remove the whole of religion. He conceives religion as the response of the "whole man" to whatever he regards as ultimately true and important, and he finds much in Christian tradition that is worthy of a rationalist's praise. And in the volume's final, positive section, "A Rationalist's Outlook," Blanshard sets out in detail what he thinks we may and may not accept from received religious tradition.The concept of "God" is one that he finds we must at least attenuate; he finds that while he can profess belief in an "Absolute" (roughly, all of reality regarded as a logically and causally coherent whole), this Absolute does not share enough features with the "God" of traditional theism that Blanshard feels able to retain that word as a description of his own quasitheistic belief. Nevertheless he also does not argue for scrapping the concept completely, and his disagreements with more traditional theists are always presented with the utmost generosity.Despite its fairly explicit focus on Christianity, this brilliant work also presents a model for budding nontheists in other traditions who seek to take a similarly sympathetic-yet-critical approach to, say, Judaism or Islam. For Blanshard, the primacy of reason does not involve wholesale rejection of religion as inherently "irrational." Indeed, he concludes that reason, properly conceived, has been the unadmitted architect of religion all along, and that taking it seriously is precisely the way to transform our world for the better.Blanshard, in short, takes the service of reason as his own religion. His thorough account should be read by anyone who takes either reason or religion with the seriousness such topics deserve.

review/text: This book was a big disappointment. I became a huge fan of Sedaris' work after reading "Naked" and "Me Talk Pretty One Day." Both those books were hilarious and, sometimes, even touching. After thoroughly enjoying his prior work, I anxiously awaited his next. Unfortunately, "Dress Your Family" does not even come close to the standard set by his earlier books.In this book, instead coming across as the witty, insightful goof that often says what most of us wish we could 1) actually think of to say; and 2) have the nerve to say, he now comes across as just negative, petty, and bitter. Unlike his prior books, I did not find myself agreeing with Sedaris' insights, but instead feeling more like I just wanted to shake him and tell him to stop being negative and such a jerk. In his earlier books Sedaris came across as a man who loves his family but is able to point out there various quirks. In this book, he is so negative about everything regarding his family, it really does not appear he likes them very much and that they do not like him.Moreover, whereas Sedaris previous gave us humorous insights into his family -- to such a degree the reader could actually feel as though he was a part of Sedaris' family or at least that he likes Sedaris' family -- in "Dress Your Family" Sedaris' focus on the negative becomes just depressing and provides none of the warm, fuzzy feelings about his family. When Sedaris writes about his mother's dying, his sister-in-law's inability to have additional children, his sister's inability to hold a job, the reader does not laugh along with his family, but instead just gets bummed out.A couple of the stories in the book are still quite funny -- "Six to Eight Black Men" for example -- but as a whole, the book was not funny. I did actually laugh out loud several times while reading "Naked" and "Me Talk Pretty." Such was not the case with "Dress Your Family." Perhaps Sedaris has already used up all his amusing life stories in his earlier works and all that are left are the downers.My advice, read his earlier work. THAT work you will enjoy. I doubt you will enjoy this book.

review/text: If you love seeing stuffed shirt heroes get their comeuppance, this is the book for you. Tarquin thinks he can pick his bride just as carefully as he might select the menu for an event. Naturally, nothing goes as he plans.Sibly is the unexpected guest -- the guest he really doesn't want -- and of course, the woman he really needs in his life. It doesn't take Tarquin long to figure out he would be crazy to marry any of his &quot;perfect&quot; brides, no matter how much planning went into their selection. It takes him a little longer to admit that the best choice has been in front of him all along.The would-be brides add much of the humor -- but the funniest moments come from Tarquin's reactions to the chaos.Though this is a farce, don't let that keep you away. There are also lots of passages of subtle humor. Now that I think about it, I might reread this shortly...Anne M. Marble Reviewer, All About Romance

review/text: Originally published in 1963, James Baldwin's, "The Fire Next Time", is an indicator of what society was like as many viewed it, and forces questions about the degree of change that has happened since he originally wrote the work. The position or the perspective of the reader, will greatly affect how each reader reacts. One issue that I do not believe can be doubted is that this is a powerful, and passionate book, written and published at a time the Author risked all manner of hatred and violence upon him. Published when Mr. Baldwin was 39, the book is not the rose colored view of youth, nor the writing with an entire lifetime to reflect upon. It does not suffer from the first, nor does it fall short do to the latter. It is writing that will elicit powerful emotions by all those who read it.Great change for the better has taken place. Former Joint Chief Of Staff Colin Powell will soon occupy the most powerful post ever held by a person of color in this Country's History. This was probably unmanageable in 1963. However this example does not represent the state of change in our Society. As an argument for how much change has taken place for the better between the races, a person pointed out to me the march on the anniversary of the sick events in Selma Alabama, and the lack of any violence. My feeling was that if the President Of The United States had made the same march with the same people in 1965, as the President did recently, the violence would surely have been different. The participation of The President and all that surround him tend to minimize Civil Rights abuse in his presence.There is no definitive measure of how much change has taken place, who is responsible, and who if anyone is to blame. The ease with which "The Race Card" is played by individuals of any color, at any level of our Country may not measure change, but it certainly does indicate that whatever change is needed is not yet completed.A very powerful work about a conflict that still occupies too much time as an issue in our Nation. This book is one man's views, and his shared personal experiences. He writing is not the final word, but after 38 years, the fact that his work and his thoughts are still relevant, speaks for the work and the man who wrote it.

You do not need a PhD in economics to understand this book and armed with it you could straighten many a PhD out. This book is equally valuable for a teenager just starting in economics or someone well read in the subject.Hell, I might buy it again.

review/text: The Scarlet Letter is a work of genius. Nathaniel Hawthorne tells his story with astonishingly perfect art. The plot is flawless (except for the final chapter). His prose style, though difficult, is entirely appropriate to the seriousness of his themes. We are taken into the mid-seventeenth century world of the Puritan New Englanders with brilliant economy, the social and natural scene is superbly rendered, the drama is immediately and vividly brought before us.In a holier-than-thou community where the sinner (a person who has broken one of God's commandments) is forever judged, damned and punished, a young woman, Hester Prynne, has been found guilty of adultery. She will therefore be made a permanent example of. The story of the rest of Hester's life is one half of what the novel is concerned with, showing us the goodness and healthy rebelliousness of the human heart that must, and does, prevail.The other half of the story concerns Reverend Arthur Dimmesdale, Hester's lover (the father of their 'unnatural', illegitimate child), who only near the end reveals his crime to the people of the town. Before this occurs, unlike Hester, who is almost completely ostracised and forced to always wear a scarlet letter A, for Adultery, he is venerated as a saint by the community. His confession exposes the whole compromised, hypocritical system - outcome of a movement which began (history records) with hopes of being a 'new Zion', 'a city set on a hill'.The novel is at its most intense when revealing Dimmesdale's profound spiritual torment as he struggles with his feelings of guilt and need to both confess and keep hidden his 'fallen' state. Our appalled identification with him, as he recognises his utter damnation (his conscience continually pricked by Hester's vengeful, cold, intellectual husband, whose true identity only she knows), shows us the full horror of believing sins are never forgiven and must be defeated through suppression of 'corrupt' human nature.As well as the justly famous symbolism, the story is composed of many other elements, including fable, psychology and the simplest down-to-earth realism. Reading it is to feel that all life - however circumscribed - is here. The characters, especially Hester and Dimmesdale, are so well drawn they rise above symbolic limitations. They are fully realised human beings, with recognisable flaws and virtues.The Scarlet Letter is a book for all humanity and all time. It took me to a world which I sometimes found oppressive and very nearly life-denying, yet due to Nathaniel Hawthorne's artistry an infinitely enriching and always enjoyable experience. These are, after all, the surest signs of a great novel.

review/text: Jeff McAndrew tells the story of living with and loving his son Stephen, who happens to have autism. The straight-forward, open approach to a wide variety of topics should be of great help to other families dealing with this condition. I especially appreciated the addition of comments of others - parents and professionals - who also are concerned about children with disabilities. It's important to remember that interventions which are effective for one child with autism may not be at all helpful to another, and vice versa. Finding interventions that work, as well as a strong support network, can make a critical difference in a family's ability to enjoy and appreciate a special child such as Stephen.

Without a doubt he has an amazingly heavenly voice which is on full display in all its glory in his debut CD. He pours all his emotion in each song. Aiken doesn't just sing it. He feels it. And I felt it. He hits every note, and every range possible. First on the list, INVISIBLE, is a definite radio friendly hit. The listener will sway and bop to this likeable beat. I WILL CARRY YOU has a soaring, spine-tingling crescendo, and it leaves a good ache in your heart. THE WAY is a beauty. YOu just need to listen to it.THIS IS THE NIGHT is added to the track, and I must say, it is no wonder it was the #1 song for weeks. love it. TOUCH has a sort of latin beat to it. I wish it will be release and hit the radio waves b/c it is a sure-fire hit. Great beat, and a whole lot of rhythm and funk to it.

review/text: This is an excellent and extraordinarily thorough analysis of how the Soviet space program went from the highs of Sputnik and Vostok (covered in the author's first book) to the disappointments of the failed attempts to launch a circumlunar mission or an actual manned lunar landing. If the book is a perhaps excessively detailed and not a light read, I think that's fine, because it also answers the many questions I always had of what REALLY happened during these tense years of the Soviet/American space race. The Soviet efforts were for so long shrouded in mystery and even when revelations came they seemed incomplete. I think this author's strong emphasis on original source material and exhaustive research have been well rewarded. If you want the complete story, this is a must have.

review/text: ... but did you also know you need it? Why? Because on a top end machine the following games have settings that go way past the limitations of even this card - Microsoft Flight Simulator 2004, Doom 3, FarCry and the soon to be released Half-Life 2. These are all new engines that will drive the games of tomorrow, meaning that I will probably be trading this one in for Xmas 2005 when the 512 line should make its mark. Anyway how does this card pan out?First of all it is a nightmare if you setup your card on a television and then forget to change it back for use with a monitor. So learn a lesson well about these monitor/television compatible cards. Make sure to change the Display Properties to whichever type you are using next because if you don't then you will not see anything and thus can not change it back. Next you need to know that these cards are top of line and make quite a great deal of noise. We are talking about listening to something like a 50cfm fan in your box doing the rounds. You are probably going to want to run your box cooler with these types of high-end chipsets running to get the most out of them so go searching on the net for a good environmental setup.All these new series of graphics card come with DirectX 9.0c or higher but the real key to unlock this God is with the new ATI range of drivers that enhance and accelerate the visual experience - CATALYST (Basically complete Real-time 3D immersive game play*). The four games for this card I have already mentioned (Playing it with Counter-Strike: Source is extremely good although I believe maybe a 128mb would give virtually the same playability for now). So if you want those games then consider this card.FarCry has an exceptional environment with something like X100 zoom on your binoculars. The enemy AI is unreal but in terms of graphics it is a real ride with this card. I believe you need this card for the full FarCry experience; however I do not believe that it pushes this card to its limit.MS Flight Simulator 2004 does push this card past it limits. Put everything up full in the details panel and look out the window over populated areas. You will see a delay and suddenly several sectors start to pop up. A 512mb card will make that game real-time.Doom3 has the ability to actually configure to a 512mb card if one existed now. Doom3 is an experience and a half, not 100% but unlike anything you have seen before and pretty scary to say the least. Anyway with this card the demon disintegration graphics are akin to watching someone getting beamed up in front of you. The lighting dynamics are also crucial to the game play. Get Doom 3 and this card and you will be stunned by something that looks like an XBOX 2 or PS3.Half-Life 2 is not yet released (Nov. 16th 2004 release date) but if you buy the new Bronze edition from Steam you can DL the encrypted HL2 files onto your HD along with CS: Source and Play Source right away which is a big improvement on any version of CS you have seen. Anyway it looks top spec on this card but I believe a 128mb card can play Source at it highest settings. Anyway the point is to look for the HL2 video and know that in reality HL2 is going to cost you $300 if you want the full experience.It's a tough cookie but let's face it. You have no choice. Now go work or Beg for it. We all did it!*As for using unsupported ATI drivers for this card. Well even Catalyst is unsupported (Use at your own risk from ATI sort of thing) so hammering around with this card is probably not a bad idea however it is always useful to do that after the card has passed its warranty but the choice is there is you want it. Personally I would stick to the ATI releases and get some good tutorials on your computer environment5 Stars but an XBOX is almost the same price.

review/text: Although Daniel Auteuil does his usual excellent character portrayal in this film, as an accountant who pretends to be gay to save his job with a condom manufacturer, it is Gerard Depardieu who steals the film. Depardieu plays a homophobic colleage who first schemes to get him fired and then seeks to engratiate himself with Auteuil in order to save his own job. I like this film better than this director's "The Dinner Party." For one, the other film has no counterpart to the hilarious Depardieu, found only in "The Closet." Director Francis Veber can deliver with French comedies and that genre needs a resurrection from its glory days of the 1970s.

Nowhere does it say that your bike needs to have a rear wheel with a quick release skewer to be able to use this trainer. It wasn't until I got to that part of the installation that I realized I would need to buy a new wheel to be able to use the skewer they provide that locks into the trainer. Maybe that's an obvious thing that I should have known about, but I was unaware. I could use a new wheel so I'm not too upset about it, but you should know about this before you decide to buy the trainer.

If your child loves to sing then I highly recommend this video. It teaches the child everything they need to know to start reading music and it is fun! It is worth every penny. The only downside is the video does not teach your child to play any songs but it does teach them the basics of reading music. It would be great if they could throw in a simple song at the end.

review/text: I'd always heard great things about numark products, so I decided to roll the dice on the PT01, a big mistake. The good, is that it is a light weight truly portable turntable. The built in speaker provides pretty good sound for being a small speaker. Why the 1 star? b/c the player is poorly constructed. The shiny top piece is poorly glued on, and pops up rubbing against the record while its playing. This causes the record to wobble and creates a very poor sound. I had to put a weight on the player to keep the piece from popping up in order for it to play properly. Little to say I will be staying away from numark products, and I highly recommend that anyone in the market for a player such as this look else where.

review/text: George Milton, a little man physically, tried to receive a harvesting job along with his close friend Lennie, who on the other hand, is a giant of a man physically, but very slow mentally. George acted like Lennie's older brother and watched out for him. Their boss stated, "Well, I never seen one guy take so much trouble for another guy. I just like to know what your interest is" (25). "Lennie kills without malice-- animals and people die simply because of his strength. Lennie himself must die simply because within the society of man he is an anomaly and weak." The theme of the book is universal," a friendship and a shared dream that makes an individual's existence meaningful." The great, classical novel will remain well read, and a well-liked book for ages to come. The book Of Mice and Men by John Steinbeck is an attempt to reveal "commitment, loneliness, hope, and loss remains," along with the labor forces in the late 1930's. Reader can easily relate to the characters and setting in the novel and, as a result, the book has influenced many readers. The book had great significance on the readers during the time in which the book was written. The style of writing is very simplistic, easy to understand, and very entertaining. " Part of Steinbeck's greatness lies in his ability to capture this tone of basic reality." Steinbecks'style of simplicity and easy reading in Of Mice and Men captures the reader's interest right from the get go, and along with the easy relating themes and plot keeps the readers attention until the last words are read. "John Steinbeck is famous for his compassionate depiction of people of the bottom of American Society," In this book, like so many of his others, he describes the time period, social events, and gives a clear pictures of what life was like. Steinbeck is mostly known for his great attention to detail and his sense of social justice in Of Mice and Men. George is a small man, who not only has himself to look after but also has the job of looking after and caring for his mentally delayed friend Lennie. George said, "Whatever we ain't got, that's what you want. God a'mighty, if I was alone I could live so easy. I could go get a job an' work, an no trouble. No mess at all, and when the end of the month come I could take my fifty bucks and go into town and get whatever I want" (11-12). As they grow up they find the true friendship they have is so important, along with the commitment to one another. This great novel will remain a classic forever.

review/text: I bought this book because it seemed to be highly regarded by other parents of multiples. However, I have been disappointed in the overall content. While Elizabeth Noble does a fine job of pointing out that carrying and delivering multiples is often risky (which I knew -- that's why I wanted a book!), she inserts a lot of personal bias and commentary into passages that are presumably meant to be factual/informational. Those of us who are not strongly interested in an organic, vegetarian/vegan diet, and those of us who are NOT REMOTELY interested in childbirth without pain meds, might find the tone of the book off-putting.The many cross-references could be valuable resources for the reader, but the references and information do tend to be older. The first edition of the book was published in the early 1980s; subsequent editing has not addressed Ms. Noble's reliance on studies from the 1970s. Without more recent information on twin mortality and complications, it is difficult for the reader to determine what is REALLY worrisome or advisable.My biggest concern about this book is its focus on all the things that could go wrong. It's true that expectant mothers need to be informed, but we also need to be supported and reminded that the vast majority of twin pregnancies result in two perfectly healthy babies. FWIW, *most* resources that I've seen focus on the scary side -- but the fact that they all do it doesn't make it ideal.I plan to buy another, more recent book to get me (and my babies!) through my twin pregnancy.

review/text: Steve Berry's third book reflects an author more comfortable in telling a story. This increasingly popular novelist has developed a narrative style that allows the reader to ponder the material, yet experience recreational pleasure as well.In the prologue, a child named Lucia has just experienced her third now-famous vision of the Virgin Mary at Fatima.In response to questions from bystanders, Lucia explains, "It's a secret and the Lady told us not to tell." And it is that very secret, as well as the part of the secret the church does not reveal, that will keep a reader awake into the wee hours, turning the pages with expectation.All the characters in this book are more interesting and more rounded, especially the women. Even the sinister candidate for pope, Valendrea, comes around to grace, although it is a minimal sort of grace. Two central characters who have a past together, Colin Michener and Katerina Lew, undertake a journey that is not only physical but also spiritual. In the final pages, the narrator slips into Colin's voice. "He knew," goes the passage, "that of the thousands gathered around him, only he and Katerina truly understood. God was alive. He was there. Listening."The Third Secret entangles interesting characters in a web of deceit and a journey towards truth. That it may offend some because of the plot resolution comes as no surprise. But history supports bloodshed and strife not only in the Catholic faith, but in denominations that comprise every other major religion. History also supports a record of the subordination of women. Each major religion's dependence on women as childbearers, propagators of the future faithful, is well-documented. The novel also explores peripheral issues such as a person of color becoming pope.What is also inspiring to me as a reader with diverse interests and a curious rather than myopic intellect, involves the fact that only in a free country could a book like this be written. In a country where freedom of thought and expression is not allowed, such a book might be banned because those with power might place their own ideologies above those of the populace. That we have freedom of expression regarding religion is, in my opinion, one of the most important freedoms we have, considering our country was founded upon that basis.The Writer's Note at the end offers information on both facts and fictions. Secrets, mysticism, history and a just-plain-good tale entwine in a book that inspires musing after the covers are closed. You can't ask much more than that from a novelist.

review/text: One of the largest contributions of this book is its effort to combine economic history with cultural analysis. Livingston takes the time to distinguish important structural changes in the US economy during this period (1850-1940). More cultural historians and critics should grapple with this material--Livingston can wean us off of blanket labels ("incorporation," "Gilded Age") that leave no room for thinking through the more dynamic relations of the economic and the cultural.A second virtue of this book is Livingston's provocative, polemic argument. Although his political sympathies are with the left, he offers a strong critique of the tendency among left historians to see the emergence of corporate capitalism as the effective end to any chance for victory on the left. This "tragic" mode of analysis, Livingston argues, means we can only remain mired in a nostalgic orientation toward the past. Livingston turns to two cultural formations--literary naturalism (especially the fiction of Theodore Dreiser) and pragmatism (especially William James)--to argue for a "social self" that offers hope for political progress but is not inherently at odds with corporate capitalism. I'm still not sure if I buy Livingston's argument, but his frame of analysis and reflections on history and models of selfhood are tremendously fruitful.Although the book is largely an advanced academic study, it is clearly written and free of jargon. Well read students of American history and culture will be able to follow the analysis.

review/text: Lousy and disrespectful adaptation of the Comic Book Hellblazer is a travesty of a high order. Who ever thought that Keanu Reeve would have been perfect as John Constantine should be fired for sheer in competence. Keanu takes a great role and basically craps on it with his lousy acting. Of all the actors involve, only Rachel Weisz and Peter Stormare are able to transcend the horrible script, which manages to contradict itself in the last forty-five minutes of the movie, and the climax is a horrible joke in itself. The special effects were decent but I have seen better on TV plus the plot is taken from an episode of Buffy the Vampire slayer. They should have just called it Keanu The vampire slayer instead.

review/text: Let's face it: Goldfrapp is amazing, and so are their remixes. But Alan Falke could have done a better remix for Number 1. I think the best one so far is the Chumbomundo Rework by Superchumbo. It takes the song and puts it on a higher key, transforming it into an even sexier song. Unfortunately, the full version and dub are promo-only. However, the rework is included as an edit in "Ultra.Dance.07" as the "Superchumbo Remix". Listen to it and you'll see why I love it.

review/text: Dierks is OK, decent even, but he's not progressing enough...it's more of the same. This is fine with many artists, but Dierks is not ALTERNATIVE enough, if at all. He's tried to play both sides of the fence on his last 2 records...mainstream and alt-country, and it's getting old. Be one or the other, and it seems he's leaning more on the mainstream side on this new album, which I don't like. I HATE mainstream country, there's no edge, no real ROCK & ROLL in it, and it's tailormade for radio, and I can't stand mainstream country radio. On this record, it seems the label is trying to mold Dierks into being all mainstream. No way man, he blew it this time. He doesn't have enough of an inner hunger or independent streak. If anything, one new country record out this week that blows this one away is Vince Gill's new 4CD extravaganza of 43 NEW SONGS!!! Each disc focuses on a distinct style: catchy rock, southern soul/blues, traditional country, and acoustic/bluegrass. Vince wrote or co-wrote all the songs, plays lead guitar on all of them, co-produced it all, and he doesn't give a damn about having a hit single, ie it's not COMMERCIAL, and he's true to his art and his strengths, which is more important and makes Vince kind of alternative...Dierks should follow this path and defy what his label wants...independent alternative artistry is more important than hit singles, which are actually detrimental to any career, as they put artists into a box. Dierks CAN break the mold and escape this mentality, while there's still time...we'll see...nice packaging on the limited edition though...

review/text: There really isn't much I can add to what has already been said about this wonderful Thomas Hardy novel. One of the things that really struck me about Tess was the importance of setting and how Hardy relates Tess's emotional state to the setting in which she finds herself. The contrasting settings of Talbothays Dairy and Flintcomb-Ash seem to represent the opposing forces in Tess's own life.At Talbothays, the air is &quot;clear, bracing and ethereal,&quot; the river flows like the pure River of Life,&quot; and the atmosphere &quot;set up (Tess's) spirits wonderfully.&quot; For Tess, the valley where the dairy is located is akin to Paradise and she feels an emotional high while she is there.In the dairy, itself, the milkers form &quot;a little battalion of men and women,&quot; often &quot;singing songs to entice the cows to produce milk.&quot; Everyone works together to bring about a common goal, a common good. At Talbothays, Tess is able to escape the pressures and prejudices of Victorian England. She is at the peak of happiness in her life and falls in love and marries the intellectual and difficult Angel Clare.It is when her marriage to Angel fails, that Tess moves to the dreary and desolate Flintcomb-Ash. Flintcomb-Ash is in direct contrast to Talbothays. There is not a single &quot;green pasture,&quot; nor anything besides &quot;fallow and turnips everywhere&quot; at the &quot;starve-acre place.&quot; Here, Tess reaches a new emotional low and her heart is as empty and dark as the setting in which she finds herself. In contrast to the camaraderie at Talbothays, at Flintcomb-Ash, &quot;nobody come near (Tess)&quot; as she stands &quot;enshrouded in her uniform&quot; working &quot;hour after hour.&quot; The other workers at Flintcomb-Ash do not fare much better and most are kept busy in the fields in order to earn enough money to simply survive. There is no time for friendship in this place.Obviously, Hardy was a master at description and the use of setting to emphasize the emotional state of his characters, Tess in particular. Although this book is a masterpiece of sensual language, Tess is also a wonderful example of the use of contrasting settings to convey strong emotional states in a way that mere words alone never could. Tess is a book that should not be overlooked by anyone.

review/text: This book has all the Asimovian trademarks: intriguing ideas marred by utterly forgettable and indeed interchangeable characters, cringe-inducing dialogue, and a plodding storytelling style and pace. Later in his career Asimov fixed these problems *somewhat*, but at this point he was very young and they are present in full force. The unfortunate truth is that this book simply doesn't deserve the praise heaped upon it; it's some kind of herd mentality that leads to so many people venerating Foundation. If you are seriously into science fiction, then by all means read the entire Foundation series: it has historical importance and there is enjoyment to be had there. But I hate to think that there are people who are introduced to science fiction by this book.

review/text: This is going to be a long review, but Clay deserves it. I'll just go track by track and then give you my thoughts at the end, mmkay? (Songs with an asterisk are ones that you should feel free to include on your next mix CD.)*1. Invisible: solid, solid track with a very catchy chorus--the kind that gets stuck in your head for two hours and you don't mind at all. It makes great use of Clay's voice in reverbs and stylistic background additions (can there ever be too much of his voice?). This is one of the best tracks; I'm glad it's first.2. I Will Carry You: another contagious chorus. This song was so hyped in articles on the Internet, though, that I kind of expected more from it. It contains &quot;stock&quot; lyrics (meaning you could buy them anywhere) but I like &quot;when the stars go blind,&quot; haven't heard that before. The song grows on your after about three listens.3. The Way: &quot;There's somethin' 'bout the way you look tonight&quot;--and then you can't resist continuing with &quot;never seen you shine so bright...&quot; which is a BAD thing. But the song has a lovely chorus which contains good use of harmonies. And--what the heck? Enrique Iglesias gets a writing credit? You just never know these days... I can see them trying to make this his next single (although I recommend track 12).4. When You Say You Love Me: this song is country-flavored, which is a nice change and Clay is, after all, a country boy. However, it's still down there on my list of favorites. Religious lyrics: &quot;if you wanna make God laugh, all you gotta do is tell him your plans&quot;--it's a great line.5. No More Sad Songs: a song with better lyrics overall than the previous four, especially lines like &quot;you are formally rejected.&quot; &quot;No more sad song&quot; (which is actually supposed to be the title) imitates a spontaneous emotion, which is cool. This song's a little more edgy, I suppose, but Clay only really digs into it once or twice. This should be more memorable, but it's not.6. Run To Me: not one of my favorites, and although there are more stock lyrics, I do like the story they tell. His voice sounds strained when he sings up high for some reason, and that really takes the song down a notch for me. Definitely one of the &quot;power ballads&quot; that critics were waiting to pounce on.*7. Shine: one of the way better ones. Another religious lyric refers to &quot;the sinner and the saint&quot; who fight the battle within; I really enjoy the &quot;church&quot; chord that plays after he says that; little things like that make a song better. It sounds more like a contemporary pop song than most on this CD, which he CAN do whether or not he believes it. This is one of the few songs where his singing is understated.8. I Survived You: again, much better lyrics in this song, especially in the chorus. But wait--Clay says &quot;I'll be damned&quot;!! What the--!9. This is the Night: yup, we've said all we can say about this one.10. Perfect Day: it's an ambitious song, trying to set a style with a heavy piano hook right in the middle of the chorus. But when he sings &quot;it's gonna be a perfect day,&quot; he really nails it, and gives the song some extra spike.11. Measure of a Man: again, his voice is a bit strained in the chorus, and I just can't fathom why. And again, low on that list. (I know, I know, he really wanted it on the CD, and that's cool and all...)*12. Touch: the best song on the album; they saved a great surprise for last. NEEDS TO BE his next single. I know a lot of his fans don't like contemporary pop, but this song--with a great hook and extra-cool beats--needs to be the blueprint for his next album. Clay just totally pulls this song off, and I always suspected he could do this! David Eriksson, the song's producer, is a genuis, and I'm so glad he believed in Clay enough to do this. The chorus is again contagious, and reminiscent of Enrique Iglesias' &quot;Rhythm Divine,&quot; only this song is not nearly as grandiose, which is great. When Clay fades away with &quot;girl, 'cause your touch is so right,&quot; he really feels it and it doesn't sound strange at ALL. I know I'm going on and on, but this track is as near as it gets to groundbreaking.So--on with the &quot;not so good&quot; stuff: there are too many songs showing off his upper range and not enough time spent making his great low range fuller and more resonant. The choruses are more memorable than the verses in almost all the songs, and it doesn't have to be that way--see Kelly Clarkson's &quot;Low,&quot; Pink's &quot;Just Like a Pill,&quot; Alanis's &quot;Ironic.&quot;The &quot;good&quot; stuff: Clay's voice alone makes it worth playing the whole CD through every time. He CAN do contemporary pop, as evidenced by &quot;Invisible,&quot; &quot;Shine,&quot; and &quot;Touch&quot; (see a pattern?). In terms of overall, it's as neatly put together and consistent as another great album, Daniel Bedingfield's &quot;If You're Not the One.&quot; I really want the best for Clay, and I'm so glad that he's proven to me (if not the critics who yearn sexy cookies) that he can do more than we thought. Except rap. Never rap, Clay.His next album: so, I already said that songs in the vein of &quot;Touch&quot; need greater play time next time around. I'm thinking--5 songs like &quot;Touch&quot; and &quot;Invisible&quot;, 4 beautiful ballads, and 2 or 3 that experiment, like have him only accompanied by a guitar on one, and have him sing another song entirely a capella (that would just blow me away). Clay, the future can really &quot;shine&quot; if you let it.

review/text: This is the assured second short story collection by the terrific Kentucky writer Crystal Wilkinson. This author has met the challenge of voice - the people of Water Street sound just like themselves. Their speech and their inner dialogue ease into the reader's head and heart, and stick there.Reasons to read this book:1. The dialogue. As a white person, I felt privileged to read the generous language of black culture, which this African American author uses with verve. Ms. Wilkinson lets me and readers like me in on the secrets of another culture and language, and it's exciting.2. The drama between outer and inner lives. The author's skilled hand paints the particular customs and habits of the interwoven outer lives of the people of Water Street at the same time she reveals to readers the particular secrets, griefs, traumas, and hopes of these compelling characters. The result is fresh, a combination of solid description of what anyone could see by looking and juicy surprises that lie beneath the mostly benificent surfaces of both people and place.3. The complex, believable men. The author paints women with accuracy and insight - but we expect this of an accomplished woman writer. The bonus here is the men. The men in this book are like most men you and I know. They aren't voracious womanizers; they aren't child abandoners; they are humans. They think about their lives, they want to do well, they make mistakes, they work, grieve, and try to fix problems. Ms. Wilkinson's male characters live multi-dimensional lives, and she takes us straight into their ways of seeing their actions, mistakes, and hopes. This is healthy and so unlike the stereotyped, lightly sketched male types that fill much contemporary literature (and the news) that it is reason enough to read this book.4. The authenticity of the few individual relationships between white and black characters. This book presents an honest picture of the "outliers" in both races who try, at times, to vault over race-based barriers to be humans together. We should put this book in a time capsule from 2002; it shows us as we are right now, after outright racial segregation has been illegal for decades, but before black and white Americans have made the changes we must make to live equitably and easily together, with mutual respect and appreciation.5. The universality of the characters' lives, problems, and experiences. Like all good tales, these particular stories of mostly African American people on Water Street in a small Kentucky town tell us much about our own humanity, no matter how different we think we are from the characters. The stories reassure us, challenge us, and, thanks to the author's great gift for gentle revelation, teach us who we are and who we can become.

review/text: Hi all,I just got my squeem in the mail today and I'm super excited! Im wearing it now! I'm 5'6 and overweight (not obese), gained a lot of weight from a medical condition so I thought this product would be perfect for me.I'm really impressed by how long it is. It goes from under your boobs (and thus, over your back-fat) right down to your crouch. It makes me feel taller because you have to maintain good posture while you wear it. I'm really excited about that. I've been wearing it for a few hours now, normally my back would be hurting by now - BUT IT ISN'T! The heat is amazing. I think it will also be great for menstrual cramps.I wear a 32 inche in jeans, but I ordered the large instead of the medium. With the large, I had a hard time putting it on. I had to have someone else hold it together so I could hook it in.I wore it while eating lunch today and it was great! It didn't make my appetite leave, but when I was full - that was it! No more eating!I haven't taken it off as yet and I'm excited to see how what my results will be. It's really comfortable, I feel like I'll have no problem wearing it to work and school and maybe even while sleeping. At first, it was hard to breathe for a few minutes, but it was much better after I adjusted. It has given my mid-section a beautiful hour-shape look to it.I'm so excited to see results!!!!The only downfall to this product so far is the price. I paid $68 with shipping and handling (Canada).If you can't afford it, ask people who care about you pitch in to help you pay for it, because its worth it. Not just for the aesthetic value (makes your tummy smaller) but the heat and posture aspect of it. I have lower back pain, from a car accident and normally I cannot sit for very long. But I have been with this thing on.If the money is too much - try to buy a used one. I saw a used one on this website for $29. I think I'll do that when it comes down to get a smaller size.Good luck ladies!!

review/text: A piano teacher superbly performed by Isabelle Huppert (one of my top favorite actress in the world), exhibits the ancient myth of Eros and Psiquis, and emerges with powerful force and dark poetry in this frustrated human being who, hidden on her art helmet, seems to watch how her best lifetime passed without any expectative. The cotidianity establishes in her life an unbearable repetition of a long catalogue of common places. Indeed, the obvious conclusion you perceive after she punishes that promising and talented pupil through the most miserable envy feeling and impotence. In her soul depths she knows her pupil will overpass her in a future not so distant.But suddenly the passion appears and with it the Pandora Box will open with her cumulative sum of expected affection, sexual repressions and the wished love that came behind the masque of the oblivion.She will play hard this role of victim and victimary. In her role of teacher the last profile is well known but she knows the time is brief and somehow as the famous Proust novel she intends to search desperately the missed time.To be honest the camera is not to the same level than the performers. Huppert is overwhelming but the camera eye doesn't maintain the same level of required fierceness and mistakenly you can feel it. If you intend to change visual agression with the deepest insights of that troubled soul avid of love and consideration, we have big problem.Think in Nagisa Oshima with the Empire Senses and you will realize that important device. The way you use your filmic language is even much more important perhaps tahn the same script if you want to accent certain issues to achieve your purpose. Otherwise you will obtain a serious artistic deficit when you analyze the final result.

review/text: I am not a fan of Melanie Griffith at all, in fact, the only film I really like her in is &quot;Working Girl&quot;. It's not that she is a terrible actress. She is just annoying. So why did I waste over 2 hours of my time watching this movie? I am now asking myself the same thing. I wasn't sure if this movie was supposed to be a comedy. If it was, it wasn't even funny. Griffith, plays Lucille, a woman who is beaten by her husband. She kills him and cuts his head off...Why? I have no idea. Maybe she's crazy? She then decides to leave her 7 children in the hands of her mother so she can go out to Hollywood and live out her dream of becoming a glamerous actress. She takes the head of her husband along for the ride...why not? Nothing else makes sense so far so why not make less sense. This film is just a mishmash of nonsense. She wins a lot of money in Las Vegas right before she gets to California. She eventually gets her big break...She is on t.v. Then, she gets caught..eventually all criminals do. I don't know what the ending of this movie is all about...She goes free? when she was sentenced to a term in prison? Maybe the book is better, I hope so, cuz this was a boring movie. I watched it on cable....thank god i waited that long.The only bright spot was Lucas Black, the boy from Sling Blade. He is one of the best child actors right now. I hope to see more of him in films. He is very charming. I personally wouldn't recommend this film.

review/text: There a several things I have come to dislike about this book. The first is in the overall treatment of the subject matter. The explanations are incomplete and sometimes you can be left wondering how one equation follows from another. Griffiths also introduces symbols or notations without giving a formal definition of what it is. As a result of this, reading the actual text is usually of no help when it comes to solving the more difficult problems. It is infuriating to look at a problem for over three hours and still have absolutely no clue as to how to go about solving it. I have no problem with very difficult problems that take hours, but I would like to spend the time actually working on the problem, instead of staring at it, wondering where to start or what that notation means that the author never defined. Not recommended.

review/text: Personalmente, algunos de los aspectos que m&aacute;s valoro de la m&uacute;sica de The Sea and Cake son su suavidad, su melancol&iacute;a mezclada con una aparente inexpresividad, el uso de acordes con muchas notas (influencia del bossa nova y el jazz) y tonalidades menores (aunque aborden las tonalidades mayores como si fueran menores) y, principalmente, el hecho de que apenas se entienda lo que canta su vocalista, Sam Prekop, por m&aacute;s que doble y superponga sus voces. En este disco se refuerza esa sensaci&oacute;n de que los m&uacute;sicos apenas estuvieran tocando, como si tuvieran susto y se les estuvieran cayendo los instrumentos, y comenzaran a ser reemplazados por las bases y secuencias. Sin embargo, todo esto que a o&iacute;dos de algunos es reprochable, para m&iacute; es muy interesante, pues obliga a una atenta audici&oacute;n de los m&aacute;s &iacute;nfimos detalles y nos lleva a entender la enorme sutileza, exquisitez y pulcritud con que est&aacute;n enfrentando su m&uacute;sica. Esta maestr&iacute;a en el arte de la sugerencia se ve, sin embargo, sumada a otros aspectos: temas un poco m&aacute;s din&aacute;micos, melod&iacute;as incocentes tocadas en los teclados para abrir las canciones, m&aacute;s sonidos el&eacute;ctricos (muy bien empastados con lo ac&uacute;stico), etc. Los arreglos y la producci&oacute;n en general son excelentes, en particular en el uso de vientos y percusiones como la marimba y el vibr&aacute;fono (tocados por John McEntire). Como de costumbre, siguen ocupando letras de temas cotidianos pero escritas pensando especialmente en su sonoridad. Aunque sea un detalle externo, vale la pena mencionar tambi&eacute;n el hermoso dise&ntilde;o gr&aacute;fico, con fotos del propio Sam Prekop. En definitiva, podemos observar la profundizaci&oacute;n de una interesante propuesta musical, que cada vez se supera m&aacute;s a s&iacute; misma.P.D.: recomiendo a quienes les guste este grupo, escuchar el disco de su vocalista, titulado simplemente &quot;Sam Prekop&quot; y, aunque a mi juicio no es tan interesante y es un poco m&aacute;s pop, el de otro de sus integrantes, Archer Prewitt, titulado &quot;White Sky&quot;.

review/text: 'One hundred Years of Solitude' is not an easy book, make no mistake about it. Or at least it is not an easy book to begin with. However, its mellifluous, dreamlike narrative, and touching appreciation of so many facets of human nature seep into the subconscious as the story of Macondo's existence unfolds, and I defy anyone to put it down if he or she is patient enough to read the first hundred pages or so.Gabriel Garcia Marquez has created a miniature world in which the inhabitants seem to be afflicted by all the horrors of human society at the same time. The novel is crammed full of so much magical imagery that at times it seems like there is nothing more that the author could have put in, yet the focus is incredibly narrow, concentrating almost exclusively on the fortunes of one incredible family.Ultimately, as Marquez doubtlessly intended, the reader emerges from the final pages as if from a slightly surreal, yet utterly fascinating dream; to adequately describe a century-worth of history in under 350 pages may seem like an impossible feat, but the author does just that and more at the denouement, by entirely subverting all that has gone before.This book is essential reading for anyone with even the slightest interest in mythology, history, sociology or just good old-fashioned story-telling.

review/text: The book animal farm was written over 60 years ago and has recently been placed in the top 100 books ever, has been turned into a cartoon for the children's film of the same name. The book was famous for mocking the Russian revolution. This is no longer visible in the film And in the eyes of a child they would have no idea what it is linked with. The film does follow the book for most of it, but the director has certain parts. He has tried to improve the plot, but after reading the book, it somewhat makes the plot worse.This is a reasonable conversion, children and people who haven't read the book will find it an average cartoon but for people that have read it will find it disappointing because the main characters are missing, main parts are missing, and some parts are randomly changed.

review/text: This is definately the way to get into Ulysses - it's meant to be heard. The language is onomatapaeic in so many places and reading it out loud or, in this case, hearing it, is often the missing element you need to receive the picture Joyce is creating. Also when the style becomes stream-of-consciousness, hearing it read gives it the rhythm you need to let it flow into something comprehensible. Check out (...) if you're interested in Joyce.

review/text: I got this book about 3 years ago, and I was really excited, because I got it for Christmas. Little did I realise I was actually getting a narative about a woman who says she can telepathically communicate with animals.Now, don't get me wrong. I have done research into the telepathic Animal Communication, even as a freshman in college right now I have done more research into it. And even though there seems to be something, I have yet to see a bonified scientific study followed by a scientific peer reviewed paper on these experiences people have. And even as a person going into a minor Psychology I know that Psychological and behavioral studies are very difficult, becuase of the amazing amount of variables that are caused by the extremely complex brain, alone. But even I can not take much of this at face value.I believe her, I don't think she is lying. I question the validity of the actual communication. Is she really linking mentally to this orca, or is this her not fully understanding the duality that many people fall into, and is she thinking that is J2 (or Granny we call her) talking to her?I really want to give her credit and I really wanted to believe her, but I can't. She didn't give me much to really grab onto as a convincing argument for her so called abilities. And she is not the first animal communicator I have done a little research on. There was one woman mentioned in "Freeing Keiko" who said that whales and dolphins were essentially extraterrestrial beings that were guiding the earth through space. Another woman said that Greyhound dogs were also extraterrestrial beings.Just the simple fact that there is glaring inconstancies between different animal communicators should be enough evidence that there really isn't too much, if anything, to Telepathic Animal Communication.It was an entertianing book, I rather enjoyed it. But I am a sceptic. And being a sceptic I would be completely honest about my position. If something really seems to make sense, I will say it does. But this book didn't. And saying that, I would not be talking about this book to my friends or family. If it does turn up in conversation, it will most likely be during our psuedopyschological studies. That is unless someone can show me a real study that is so sound as to prove me wrong. To which, if it did prove me wrong I would say so.

review/text: &quot;Jim the Boy&quot; was an alright read however I think that I was expecting something written more for adults and I felt this book was geared towards adolescents over adult readers. It is a really good story-line, however, didn't really make my brain work too much while reading it. What I really liked about the book was the simplistic lifestyle that was described, somewhat similar to that of my late grandfather. So, that was a nice little fictional peak into what it was like for my grandfather growing up in that time period.

review/text: How do you rate Righteous Victims? It is a difficult question, and not an easy thing to do. So much of what people have written here is true. This book is everything that has been written here.The book is highly readable. The book is as up to date as possible. It goes to the election of Ariel Sharon. The book has so much information it can be exhaustive at times. And yes, the book at times seems very sympathetic to the Palestinians and the Arabs. There are many examples of the author leaning a bit in that direction. HOwever, the author does make it clear in many places as well that the Palestinians and many of the Arab nations and extremists other than Egypt and Jordan have been against the peace proccess and are very anti-event the very existance of Israel.so is the book pro-palestinian? at times yes, but i think it is part of a bigger picture and goal of showing all sides and angles of the situation.The bottom line about this book or any history book is whether or not you learn new things by reading it. This book is not perfect. I do not agree with everything in this book, but this book taught be a lot about the situation, this book made me think, and this book exposed me to some point of views and historical facts i was not aware of.Ultimately, this book taught me a lot about what is going on in the Middle East and that fact alone made it a good read.

I was not disappointed.The scenes and structure had to be changed a bit for cinematic purposes as the book in it's original wording and pace did not work well for a movie. But the story is still the same. And it's a good one.The special effects are improved since the first one and several shots are mind-blowing.I cannot wait for this dvd to release. I am definitly buying the 3 disc edition and any deluxe edition after that. I encourage everyone to do the same. This movie deserves it.

review/text: The first season of Sanctuary was so cool and different. It had an aura of mystery to it, and took the viewer into this mysterious world of Helen Magnus and the abnormals and sheer fantasy of the Sanctuary. The characters were intriguing, the writing impressive, and the setting was just so unique. Each episode was like delving into a new mystery each week with intelligent problems that needed solving by the team of well balanced, thought out characters. In the words of Magnus herself from the pilot, "you are about to leave your world behind."Sadly, Season 2 failed to live up to the promise set by Season 1. Instead, Sanctuary Season 2 saw the series turn into yet another hyped up sci-fi action series. If they gave Amanda Tapping back her blonde hair and had her loose the British accent, she could have been playing Sam Carter from Stargate this season. Don't get me wrong-I love all three Stargate series. But this was Sanctuary--something new and entirely different from Tapping's other show and character.The atmosphere of mystery is gone. The weird and unique setting has been entirely normalized. The plot points became ridiculous (the Sanctuary has its own Navy-come on!) Basically, with Season 2, they have turned the show into a "shoot the monster of the week" series. I hate to say it--some of the episodes' stories this season seemed to be taken from Sci-Fi Saturday B-monster movies.Now, that being said, is the show salvageable? Yes. There were still some elements of the show this season to make it palatable. The characters were still interesting (although they need to avoid turning Magnus into another chick with a gun in sci-fi character). There were some very good episodes this season, albeit few and far between. For example--the episode with Magnus and Zimmerman and the crashed helicopter was a great character piece. And the producers already proved they could do a good show with Season 1. They just need to return to the Season 1 formula of the show to save it.I would not recommend owning season 2. If you catch it on a re-run, it would be okay because it is mildly entertaining and you won't be wasting your money. Here is hoping for something better in Season 3.

review/text: I think the point of this film is about faith. Everyone likes a good miracle movie. Right? Well, not quite. There was plenty of cringe worthy moments regarding race. Mr. Ashton calling Homer 'boy' and then telling the nuns that Smith was lazy and shiftless-but still wanted him to work for him. (Weird.) I hated the scenes where he was just shuffling to please them. And I didn't understand why Mother Maria simply couldn't say 'Thank You' especially when she was begging for everything. Out of all the good roles Poitier has played, they give him the Oscar for when he played a good field slave doing what he was told. Whatever.

review/text: It's taken me quite a while to get around to reading this one, and I hesitate to review the first book of a trilogy when I haven't completed all 3 books, but I figured I'd better get this one in while I can, as it may take me another 10 years to finish the series.I'm surprised that it took me this long to finally read &quot;Foundation&quot; by Isaac Asimov, but I can say that I'm glad I did. Actually, I didn't have high hopes going into it, as I am not a big fan of Asimov's writing. While his technical approach is always entertaining, he tends to become very stilted and ham-fisted when it comes to characterization. It was this quality that turned me off of &quot;I Robot&quot; and almost got me to give him up completely; however, seeing as the Foundation trilogy is regarded as a classic of the genre, I had to give it a shot.As everyone has said over and over (and I'll do it, too), the Foundation trilogy is a futuristic parallel of the fall of the Roman Empire and the following Dark Ages. Hari Seldon, father of Psychohistory, sees the writing on the wall and establishes the Foundation in order to buffer the fall of civilization and technology. The first book of the series, &quot;Foundation&quot;, does a good job of setting the stage for what is to come. The book is told in 5 parts, each one focusing on a different character or time period in the early history of the Galactic Empire's fall. Surprising to me, Asimov actually does a fairly good job with his characterization. There's very little melodrama, and the story is evenly paced, holding up pretty well for a tale begun in 1941. The only complaints I have with the story are that the main characters always seem to be overly confident in themselves, as if they are holding all the cards and can easily handle any adversity while blindfolded (presenting a tense situation fails if the protagonist has no concern or doubt for how things will be resolved). Also, as the different parts of the story skip a hundred years here, 30 years there, etc., it may take some imagination on the reader's part to develop a &quot;big picture&quot; of what the Empire is really going through. These are minor issues, however, and should not detract from enjoying the book.One last observation - I have noticed that Hari Seldon appears to be getting younger with each new printing of this book. My copy of &quot;Foundation&quot; from the early '80s, with cover art by Darrell Sweet, shows a decrepit, bent, wizened Seldon (as I feel he should look). The next cover, by Michael Whelan from the early '90s, shows a more healthy and happy Seldon. The cover of the latest edition, shown on this page, features a Seldon who looks like he's about to jump out of his wheelchair and punch you out. You have to love that artistic license...

Although, in the beginning, I did not particularly like Hewitt's interpretation of Audrey, after I watched it a few more times, her performance grew on me. I now find myself watching the tape weekend after weekend, hanging on her every word, waiting to see what happens next.(even though I have it memorized.) The story is amazing with all the different love struggles that she goes through. My favorite moments are all her proposals and break ups. I think that anyone who likes a good Romantic flick would love this movie. It is definately worth the watching.

When I watched the first episode of "Alias", I couldn't believe how blatantly they were stealing from "Run Lola Run".It's fun, it's fast-paced, it has a great soundtrack and it's worthy of some respect. Plus, I think Franka Potente is remarkably sexy in this movie.The DVD has some okay extras. If you're not into reading your films, then you can access the english overdub. And for fans of the soundtrack there's a music video for the single. But the real reason to but this DVD is re-watch-ability.

review/text: It's hard to believe this little book by the famed Ray Bradbury has been around for about fifty years. I remember kids talking about this book just a few years ago when I was in high school and remember thinking it was some great new work of sci-fi. With all the changes in our society and culture the past few years (from the Internet to digital television), FAHRENHEIT 451 is more significant today than it was forty years ago.The plot of the story is simple. Guy Montag is a fireman. However, in the future, instead of putting out fires, fireman start them. Guy burns books and he enjoys doing it. Books are illegal to own and most people spend their free time (and they have lots of it) driving their cars (at speeds of over 120 mph) or listening to the wall-sized televisions that have become their family. One day Guy meets a strange girl who sets a fancy to his heart. His meeting with her allows him to open up and begin to see the truth.The story is simple, but it is what the story says about our society that is so significant. We are told by the story's antagonist that things changed because the country became divided by factions of every sort and people no longer cared about the knowledge books contained. Reading forces people to think and thinking is bad because it forces you to consider others and when you only care about yourself, how can you think about someone else? In our modern American society where many people label themselves with as many hypens as possible, where lives are literally being played out on television, and where violence is becoming more and more the norm; the issues raised in FAHRENHEIT 451 need to be discussed more than ever.

review/text: Finding a COMPLETE version of this book is difficult. When the Sword and the Stone was grafted onto the rest of the series to form the Once and Future King, T.H. White removed several scenes from the book. Growing up enjoying the Walt Disney version of the film, I was disappointed when I read the Once and Future King. Where was the wizard's duel between Merlyn and Madam Mim? Surely, Disney didn't come up with that on their own.Well, the truth is these lost parts are still out there if you wish to find them. Some of the lost episodes include: Kay and Wart taken captive by Madam Mim, a wizard's duel between Merlyn and Mim, Wart and Kay battle a giant who has taken King Pellinore captive, Wart becomes a snake, and Archimedes takes the Wart in bird form to meet his mother Athene and hear a song from the trees. The version I found that still contained these passages was published in 1963 and features Disney illustrations on the cover. I do not know if other versions include these chapters, but the Once and Future King does not.Some speculate that White thought these episodes to be too childish and light-hearted, but I think they are wonderful. The Sword in the Stone is a very difficult book for children. I believe it needs these light-hearted moments to offset the preachy life lessons. Don't get me wrong, I think the lessons that can be learned from the book are innumerable, but everyone needs a little fun with their learning.If you are looking to read the Sword in the Stone, I encourage you to seek out the oldest version with the chapters still in tact. They're worth it.

review/text: I made the mistake of buying this game without renting it first. The screen shots made this game look awesome, but truley, the game fails in every aspect. First, the controls are very un-smooth and crude and handle inconsistently. The graphics are not stunning at all...there is a lack of detail to the environment and there is a lack of continuity when interacting with the environment when playing as Vexx especially when rock climbing. The game is also very annoying on several levels: Collecting stuff is usually fun - not in Vexx - in every level your goal is to collect these hearts by performing tasks or reaching certain places, or by collecting 100 orb things, anyways, I had about 97 orb things and then I saw a hidden heart piece - so I went to get that - the problem is that as soon as you get a new heart you start over at the beginning of the level with ZERO orb things! Brutally "un-fun"!...Plus the game is completely un-enchanting and unmagical like the great Zelda games. The enemies are so bland and the environments are as random and meaningless as the pointless storyline and tasks. I can't decide what is worse: Acclaim's Vexx or Turok Evolution...

review/text: Look, forget any praises of the book you have heard because it "has strong female characters" or because it's not "in-your-face Christian apologism." There are lots of things to praise about this book, but those two praises are entirely misplaced.For one thing, as long as we're discussing Lewis's improved!female characters - so far as I'm concerned, Orual is Lewis's typical example of any soul that is still prideful, in all of its grubbly and idiotic self-will (but she can use a sword well, so that will be enough for some). Psyche is someone who has conquered that self-will, but most would see her as a goody two-shoes saint. Asnit is a wife and widow - and that's about all. Redival is a typical Lewisian villain, almost absurdly sneaky and two-faced, with the added femmy element of being boy-crazy. And a magnificent fighting queen farther north is mentioned - once. I'm not saying I have anything against it on these grounds. But it's absurd to come to "Till We Have Faces" looking for a feminist book.As for the idea that this book has less overt Christianity for the non-Christian reader to swallow - well, superficially, the gods in this book are all pagan. But there are large whacks of this book I imagine I would have found very boring before my conversion - boring, melodramatic, and vague. In fact, Christian point of view aside, the two conversations between Orual and Psyche in the Shadowbrute's valley could have used an editor's red pen. The views of the Fox and Bardia (who are both good, loving men nevertheless) are examples of the ways believers can be fuddled and led astray. And towards the very end Orual is using blatantly Christian verbage: "I know now, Lord, why you utter no answer. You are yourself the answer. Before your face questions die away. What other answer would suffice?"Of course, anyone could read it, and many enjoy it. For example, the "worldly" parts of the book are very interesting from any viewpoint - life under the temperamental petty king (who, seemingly, would have found in Henry VIII a kindred spirit), the purchase of the Greek captive Fox, who becomes the girls' tutor, the skirmishes between the King and the Priest of Ungit, veiled Orual learning to fence and challenging a king in combat (with Fox saying that its "foolish and, what's more, unseemly"!), and the details of the Queen's busy and shrewd reign. And we've all been trained to appreciate Greek pagan aesthetics, so that's another element to the book anyone will like - Lewis is rich (perhaps overrich) and pretty in his symbols and pictures and visions for Orual.But this is a morality to Orual's eventual, mature judgment of herself that not everyone is going to share. For example, not everyone would have thought it shameful to admit that she (at one point!) appreciated and even encouraged Prince Trunia's flirtacious banter. For those who do, of course, it's a rich dimension to the book.The details of life in Glome are well-envisioned and enjoyable.So why did I give this three stars? I love Lewis's nonfiction works, but I've yet to read one of his fictional ones that didn't leave something to be desired (mind, I haven't yet read Perelandra). Perhaps because he is sometimes trying to be too allegorical, his characterizations usually suffer. Several in "Till We Have Faces" are maddeningly flat. This is the best fictional work of Lewis's I've ever read. But it's far from the best fictional work I've ever read.

But that is what you would expect from a Transformers. The story was lame.. I was constantly wondering what was going on because it kept jumping all over the place. There were a lot of totally unnecessary risque parts. I really was not impressed. Again this is coming from a fan of the series. I really hope they can get it right in the next one or they have lost a fan.

review/text: Tamara Dobson was fabulously stylish, sexy, and intelligent in her role as Cleopatra Jones, the Karate/Kung Fu kicking United States Special Government Agent ("jurisdiction from Turkey to Watts Tower baby") who battles Drug Lord Mommy (Shelly Winters). Cleo ruffles Mommy's feathers by burning her Turkish poppy field that has a street value of $30 million. Mommy retaliates by getting her bad cop friends to bust the B&S; House which is run by Cleo's boyfriend Rueben (Bernie Casey). The B&S; House helps local drug addicts kick the habit. The B&S; House staff have a Black Panther Party mentality.To add action and humor to the movie is Mommy's odd crew of gay beauties that cater to her every whim; clutsy henchmen; Pusher Doodlebug (Antonio Fargas, best known from "Starsky & Hutch"). Doodlebug has his own odd crew that includes his high maintenance girlfriend Tiffany (Brenda Sykes, also played in "Black Gunn"), Pickle (Teddy Wilson who went on to star on tv shows like "Good Times", "That's My Mama", and "Sanford & Son"), white chauffer/butler Mattingly (real surname). Don Corneilus (Soul Train) has a cameo as himself. Ester Rolle ("Good Times") has a cameo as the mother of Cleo's two Karate kicking friends, The Johnson Brothers. This movie has a plethora of actors, both black and white, who went on to have extensive acting careers.The well written story and screenplay is by Max Julien, who is best known for his role as "The Mack" and "Thomasine & Bushrod". The soundtrack yielded two hits, one by Joe Simon and the other by Millie Jackson.Dobson portrayed a strong black woman with a positive character. Outside of driving the James Bond type Corvette complete with phone, personalized plates, government issued weapons concealed in the door and a top that automatically raised (awesome in 1973) to accomodate Dobson's 6 foot, 2 inch height... she displayed motor bike riding skills and a little bi-lingual capabilities that must have been needed for her traveling abroad.The ending scene, the Bon Voyage party for Cleo ends with her white friend Police Captain Lou Crawford (Dan Frazer who has a very extensive acting portfolio with the likes of "Kojak", "Law & Order", and "As The World Turns") saying "Right On" while holding up a clinched fist (black power sign) as Cleo drives off into the sunset for her next big assignment. His actions amaze the other party people and is a priceless ending that should leave a smile on your face to go with this happy ending.The disconsolate news of Tamara Dobson's death in October 2006 smothered the flames of my nostalgic dreams of her reprising the Cleo role for a third time (second time circa 1975, "Cleopatra Jones and the Casino of Gold"). All biographical accounts document Tamara Dobson as having studied fashion at the Maryland Institute College of Arts before her professional modeling career. Her acting career included film appearances in "Norman... Is That You?", "Chained Heat", "Come Back, Charleston Blue", "Murder at the World Series", "Jason of Star Command", and "Buck Rogers in the 25th Century". Beyonce appears to have paid homage to "Cleopatra Jones" when she played Foxxy Cleopatra in the Austin Powers movie.Tamara Dobson's role as Cleo was a hit and this movie is a classic that would add value to any so-called blaxploitation (Soul Cinema) era movie collection.by:Pamela Jarmon

review/text: Once you try these pads, you will not be able to live without them. I am an aesthetician, I recommend them to all of my clients. They are great for breakouts, blackheads, hyperpigmentation, fine lines, uneven texture, and flaky skin. The peel is blend of both alpha and beta hydroxy acids making it an extremely effective exfoliant. The neutralizer pad is hydrating enough for dry skin yet lightweight, so it does not feel greasy making it great for oily skin as well. This product does make your skin more susceptible to sun damage so be sure to wear an spf that protects from both UVA and UVB rays while using this product (which you should be doing anyway.) Highly recommended!

review/text: You get tired of the same old romantic-adventures where the hero save the maiden and good prevails over evil. I read Jim Grimsley's DREAM BOY on recommendation from a friend in my theatre. I really enjoyed it, not so much because of the story but because of the style in which it was told. KIRITH KIRIN, much like DREAM BOY, gives you a sense of knowing the characters and growing with them. Though a little slow in the begining, once the story really got rolling I couldn't put it down. The world Grimsley has created is a complex in its peoples and history as Tolkien's Middle Earth. What I really enjoyed about this book, however, is the conflict between people; each character has the potential for good or evil, giving them each their own spirit and the ability to surprise you.The big battle near the end is not the preditcable climax of any other book that gives you a sense of closure. Rather, it makes you want to keep reading and wondering how the characters will continue the rest of their lives, and you miss them when the book is done. I wish there were a sequel, or a prequel, or something with the same characters.All in all, this is a great book for fantasy lovers of any persuasion, male or (as in my case) female.

review/text: I have never given less than 4 star review anywhere but I feel that this product needs a disclaimer. The lower rating in this case is because this is NOT a HALTI yet it is the first thing that shows up with you search for a HALTI collar on Amazon.com. For someone who doesn't know the difference, they will likely end up with this product. This collar is significantly different from a Halti. It's also easy for this collar to be used in a way that is very uncomfortable for a dog. We bought two and got to our training class only to be told that we had the wrong product. We were also told by the trainer that it an unacceptable tool for training a dog when a Halti is required. It fits differently and functions differently. When she took this product off the dog and replaced it with a real Halti, the dog behaved totally differently (in a positive way). I'm guessing that many have found this to be a worthwhile product. I'm grateful that I was shown the difference, thanks to the trainer. I'm grateful too that she pointed out how easy it is for this product to be used in a way that is extremely uncomfortable for the dog. If you find your dog trying to get this thing off, that could be why. I'm happy that we are now using a real Halti. I'm sharing this as a heads up to others so they can make an informed decision. Had there been a clear disclaimer, I would not feel the need to write this.

review/text: A mediaeval costume dram with a notable difference - twentieth century speak transposed to the 18th century in this visually satisfying and atmospheric tale of two gentlemen highwaymen who robbed from the rich aristocracy for their kicks! But the dialogue and the loud thumping techno music gives it an appeal to the older teenage generation who might not appreciate it if it were done in the style of, say, THE MAN IN THE IRON MASK. The highway robbery scenes are superbly done, Robert Carlyle and Jonny(LOVE HONOUR AND OBEY) Lee Miller relish their roles, acting as frivolously and as over the top as they can! Liv Tyler wears some particularly busty costumes as well. Filmed in London, Czech republic and Spain for the mediaeval building settings of old London and Newgate prison, this action-packed drama is best enjoyed on DVD for its soundtrack and atmospheric effects. Not to be missed!

review/text: Richard Watt has produced a readable volume that recounts the only period of modern Polish independance prior to the current one. It's complete, and seems to cover the issues reasonably well. Looming over the whole book is the figure of Jozef Pilsudski, the father of modern Poland, and he is reasonably well-described here. Good book, though the writing, while reasonable, isn't on the Barbara Tuchman-Robert Massie skill level writing-style wise.

review/text: This book has two major problems.One, its title is misleading. You think you are getting a quick, shortened version of an economics class, but what you are really getting is a conservative, free market view of the economy. If the title had been, Reasons Why The Free Market Is Better For The Economy, I would have a lot less problem with this book. Balanced, Hazlitt is not, and he takes a lot of potshots at Keynes with only the occasional quick nod to the problems the free market can run into. It's not that I disagree with a lot of his arguments, it's that you don't get both sides.Two, it's out of date. It was written in the 1940's. Oh, it's been updated alright. In the 1970's. A lot of economic events have occurred since the 1970's and the conservative view has some explaining to do.If you really want a balanced view of the economy you can check out &lt;50 Economic Ideas You Really Need to Know>. It's balanced, although a bit scatter shot. For a pretty balanced book, but with a left lean, try &lt;Economics Explained> by Heilbroner and Thurow, it tells a more cohesive story than 50 Ideas.

review/text: If only more games had scores released like this. The music in Ocarina of Time isn't necessarily the best of its kind, but it's still very well done. I don't really need to review the music, do I? If you've played the game then you know exactly what you're getting there. It's the packaging of this CD that is terribly impressive. It's well-tooled and feels like a genuine novelty of Zelda products with full color pictures in the insert, Japanse and English track titles, a GOLD CD (ahhh, reminscent of the NES Legend of Zelda gold cartridge) with a simple elegant white print on top, a map of Hyrule in the case behind the CD, and some sort of sticker that I can't bring myself to place somewhere (and let it get ruined? no way!). Lastly, the audible contents are extremely complete with not only in-game music, but the &quot;item sounds&quot; and such. The things you hear when you get an item, defeat a boss, etc.Bottom line, this CD is a great item for game/score fans and any sort of collector. It gives you a simple feeling of pleasure at just having possessed such a thing ... like when buying a video game actually meant something more than a few hours of fun. Okay, so maybe part of the fun with this is nostalgia, because it reminds me of the old Zelda's as much as the new!

review/text: The Glass House People - By Kathryn ReissThe protagonist in this book is Hannah. When Hannah was fifteen she ran away from her family, and house. She did this because she felt like she was in love with her sisters &#65533;to be&#65533; husband. One night Hannah was talking to him in his bedroom, and Iris (Hannah&#65533;s sister), walked in, and got the wrong idea. That night he was told to leave the house right away by Hannah&#65533;s an Iris&#65533;s parents. They were all crowded around the top of the staircase, and somehow he fell, cracked his head on the radiator, and died. Hannah&#65533;s goal was to have a good relationship with her family, but mainly her sister. Since what happened, she wasn&#65533;t sure if they would forgive her.Hannah&#65533;s barrier is when she brings her children, Tom, and Beth to her family at her old house, Iris is still thinking that Hannah pushed her husband . Iris refuses to forgive her sister. At the end of the book, they figure out who really pushed him.I liked the author&#65533;s writing style because she didn't go on and on, but instead she just explained what needed to be explained. When I first started to read this book, I thought that it was going to be a romance. I decided to keep reading though, and found that it was more of a mystery. I&#65533;m not one who loves mysteries, but I liked this one a lot! I would recommend this book to anyone who likes mysteries, or who likes to read books that seem realistic.

review/text: Several reviews on here have given Fahrenheit 451 a low score because they thought the premise was too far-fetched. These reviewers aren't aware of the situations that exist in certain theocracies around the world. Afghanistan under the Taliban outlawed television and women were not allowed to read or educate themselves. In several Middle East countries, merely speaking up against the government makes you a target.Bradbury looked at different phenomena in our society- the desire to not offend anyone, the dumbing-down of a society in love with television, etc., and simply extrapolated these until he reached an end very similar to the conditions that existed under the Taliban.Part of the point of science fiction is to be far-fetched, but good science fiction uses those far-fetched ideas to warn us of the dangers of the present, in this case the dangers of censorship, of political correctness, of television, and anyone who thinks those dangers are not real, that this book doesn't have relevant warnings, hasn't studied the real world enough.Everyone should read this book. It's an entertaining and easy read but also has a lot of idealogical depth behind it for those who are willing to think and read at the same time. If you don't want to think about what you read, well, go watch TV and be done with it!

Problem is, the quotes, and many of his anecdotes, just don't have anything to do with what he was talking about. He has a few good ideas buried in blather (ten ways to motivate yourself would have been better), and re-packages the same ideas into different chapters, using different quotes and anecdotes in order to reach the 100 in his title.

review/text: After years of listening to and performing blues, folk, and maritime (Celtic) music, I've recently fallen for Bluegrass in a big way. Since then, I've learned a few things about it: 1) it's deceptively hard to play, 2) it's as pure an art form as any other, yet flourishes when exposed to new influences, and 3) those who are really good at it inconspicuously turn-up everywhere.I've never been a Dolly fan, but given this CD's title and the good things I'd heard about it, I gave it a try. Guess what? Dolly knows all of this stuff, too! The music on &quot;The Grass Is Blue&quot; is overall quite traditional, yet the first cut is a Billy Joel tune! The band is a dream-team by any definition (including Jerry Douglas and Sam Bush), and the &quot;incidental&quot; musicians are equally pedigreed, including Alison Krauss, and Dan Tyminsky, among others. This is a combination that can't miss, yet Dolly by no means takes a back-seat; her peerless voice, power, and infectious charm shine through in every song, even the sad ones. To top it all off, the production is crystal-clear and flawless.Even if you're not a big fan, this one is must-have for your collection. Well worth the money!

It is great to workout to, dance to, and sing along with. The music is &quot;POP&quot; but it is not a lot of sexed up junk. I have found my favorite song on the cd is &quot;Perfect Day&quot; if that is not released as a single they will miss out on some real chart popping magic. Clay Aiken still shows his talents and does each song justice. I give kudo's to him, the music writer's and the entire RCA group that worked on the CD. I cannot wait to see this young man do all of this in concert. I am curious as to what songs they took off of the cd and if RCA will be smart enough to have Clay croon some classics like he did on A.I. I would like to hear a studio version of Solitare, To Love Somebody, Somewhere Out There, and many others. I know that he is not a one hit wonder and we will be hearing from him for a long time to come God willing. Excellent CD!!!!

review/text: Definitely an interesting book, but "not quite there." Lazare's understanding of the strucutrual problems as they relate to the Constitution and slavery was very good, and, indeed, many on both the pro-slavery and abolitionist side argued against the Constitution as it stood.Where Lazare goes wrong is in the later years. His analysis of the drug war and the government policies that, in effect, subsidized suburbia, were both good, but not really having anything to do with the Constitution, either that I could judge or he could coherently argue. His overarching strucutural approach led him to see a systemic failure when others may see only a failure of policy. To impute the former from the latter simply begs the question.I'm also not sure why he thinks that government would become more progressive as a result of a more powerful House of Representatives. The notion that many different groups have varied, legitimate, but ultimately incommensurate views regarding what government can and should do presents a blindspot for Lazare. To take his example of the drug war, while it is true that medical marijuana resolutions do well, very few politicians, other than New Mexico Gov. Gary Johnson have been elected on a pro-legalization platform. If anything, the prevailing rhetoric has been to get "tough on crime." Yet, Lazare thinks that more direct democracy can and will lead to greater progressivism. Maybe we're better with checks and balances. Also worth noting is that a lot of the strength of American Democracy is that, to use the hoary old cliche, it's a republic of laws, not men. An overarching legal framework has some value, then.Interestingly, some issues where the Constitution, at least as presently interpreted, may present issues he'd want to discuss, went missing. No real discussion of Campaign finance appeared, and he did not mention voter turnout, once. Does low voter turnout have anything to do with the Constituion? Well, not really, unless you want to use Lazare's ideology, in which the lack of good public transit does. Nevertheless, these strike me as the real issues facing American democracy, but they don't require constitutional overhaul to address.I also think he does himself a disservice by not really considering any prevailing theories of jurisprudence other than the bi-poles of William O. Douglas and Robert Bork. He also takes Bork's strict constructionism at face value, which is, while unfortunate, does serve his ultimate project."The Frozen Republic" is intersting in parts, but really, he's stretching quite a bit to make his criticisms of present policy and discourses a systemic attack on the Constitution, qua constitution.

Many, many years went by and then suddenly I saw an ad of the album &quot;15 minutes&quot; on a local paper. I was scared: would it destroy all the good memories I had?

Imagine a guy sitting on a full bus crying and smiling listening to Nik Kershaw. But I couldn't help myself.It's so rare in today's pop-music that you can instantly hear true emotions from the music. And now I don't mean just the lyrics, but the music itself.Also, the album is so full of the most wonderful and catchy melodies that after you've heard the album a couple of times you won't be able to sleep. You simply can't get rid of the music. The arrangements are also interesting as they were already in the eighties.I've never read a single interview of Nik, but still I love the guy.

review/text: These guys are simultaneously a rock and roll treasure and a rock and roll tragedy. This is one of the best albums of the era--every song on it is tremendous and instead of being one-hit wonders, S&T; should have dominated the airwaves like Fleetwood Mac or the Eagles.The only thing better than this was the demo that got them their record deal. The demo, which featured these songs played by Loggins & Messina's band and recorded by their production team is so much better than this admittedly hit-bound recording, it's sick. The grooves are slinkier, Townsend doesn't sound so stiff and ready for radio. The whole demo has this organic southern smile on it that is truly amazing. Why Warner's re-recorded it is a mystery. Maybe the guys can get the rights to their demo tracks and release them on CD. Hell, it's only been 30 years. Now that would be something to buy!Still "Smoke" is a tremendous record. None of the later records came close.

review/text: I purchased this H-P LaserJet printer through Amazon for about $88.00 at an "open box" sale. Amazon was adamant that I should know EXACTLY what I was buying and if had ANY DOUBTS, I should cancel my order. How's that for being "up front" (Amazon is a great company to deal with).The printer arrived tightly boxed in mint, unused condition, although the toner cartridge had already been installed. So "yes" the box had been already been opened (exactly as stated before the purchase). I installed the H-P printer software in my home assembled computer and the printer was now ready to roll. My Windows XP Operating System detected the printer immediately. I printed out a test sheet and the black and white laser print was perfect. I will soon be using this printer to print out thousands of pages of my family history (genealogy) and I won't have to worry about running out of ink in the middle of my project. The laser printer "melts the toner onto the paper so the ink is bound tightly to the paper and won't "run" (like inkjets) if there's a little moisture around. The H-P software will also allow me to do manual duplex (both sides of the paper) printing which is necessary for doing hundreds of pages that will be bound into a book. H-P knows how to design great laser printers and this is one of them. And the price has taken a tumble recently. Look for a good deal. Downside?...Gosh, does everything have to be built in Communist China these days?

review/text: Even thought I'm not the biggest of Cher fans, this movie was her crowning achievement. She won the Academy Award for this one, this was before all the tabloid stuff and her awkwardness of the 90s set in. Still, I like Cher. She's made something out of nothing, and she always lands on her feet.Cher plays someone very un-Cher in this movie, a dowdy young widow named Loretta living in New York with her extended family. They're Italian-American, loud and always at each other in someway. She has been going out with Johnny Camarary for a while, a nice mamma's boy man, and he asks her to marry him. She says yes. I loved her mom's questions: "Do you love him Loretta?", "No.", "Good. If you love him he'll drive you crazy because they know they can. But you like him then?", "Oh yeah, he's a sweet man Ma". When Johnny goes off to Sicily to care for his dying mother, he asks that Loretta make contact with his brother who he's been estranged from for years.Loretta meets Ronnie, Johnny's rough and bitter brother who holed himself up in the basement of a bakery shoveling bread dough into the coal stove. While he shows her that he's a big brute and obnoxious, he also decides once she shows her chops as a sparring partner that this is the woman he loves. After sleeping with him, Loretta wants to run away. But Ronnie pursues, and after a night at the opera together in secret, Loretta falls hard for him.This was a phenomenal movie in so many ways. It's about love, to be sure, but it's also about infidelity, secrets, lonely people, and strange behavior brought on by lunar cycles. The characters from the frumpy BoBo at the favorite restaurant, the aunt and uncle, her parents and their problems, the ancient grandfather and his dogs are all well developed characters and likable. It's somewhat of a chick flick, as it's how Loretta stops being a dowdy stuffed shirt and awakens the flower of the inner vamp. It's a Cinderella story in many ways, and that is every little girl's dream to emerge from the ugly duckling into a beautiful swan.Moonstruck is a delight and leaves you laughing everytime. Love it. And you don't have to be a Cher fan to appreciate it.

review/text: The popularity of Hardy's Tess makes me wonder why the apparent context in which the book was written seems to have been lost. Twelve years before Hardy's Tess hit the shelf George MacDonald's Paul Faber: Surgeon received a less controversial if almost equally popular release. While the two books could hardly be more different it is interesting that the fundamental plot elements are identical. A careful comparison of the scene in both books immediately following the confession of the recently-married protagonist of her youthful indiscretion to her unforgiving husband will reveal a passage where Hardy essentially quotes from MacDonald--and then flatly contradicts him. MacDonald's Faber is a longer, more complex story--perhaps less accessible than Hardy's. Where Hardy finds despair, cynicism, and ultimately destruction, MacDonald mercifully provides forgiveness, hope, and evidence of the divine in humanity.Other reviewers have heartily recommended that you read Tess to discover how accurately great literature can portray life's struggles. If you liked the authenticity and poignancy of Tess but felt there must be another side of the story, please read Paul Faber.

Instead, notice that the Jawbone comes with two round earbuds that appear to be identical. Tear the rubber shroud off one of them to expose the round plastic piece inside of it. Take this plastic piece and lock it onto the Jawbone (read user's manual). The Eargels will slip over this piece and hold quite firmly to the headset. Notice also that the Eargels have a square notch on the inside. Point the notch toward the back of the Jawbone. This will align the piece properly with the ear.The Eargels allow the Jawbone to be securely held in the ear without the annoyingly difficult earloop, but cause a little discomfort in my ear because I have to use the larger pieces. With the earloop, I can use the smallest piece and the Eargels are very comfortable.

review/text: One of the misconceptions that people who have not read this book apparently have is that the Buckle family is "reaping what it's sown" by having gotten their farm through illegitimate means (ie. colonialism). This is a very crass attitude grounded in both ignorance and racism.In fact the Buckle family purchased their farm AFTER Zimbabwean independence with the explicit written promise from Mugabe's government that the land would not be targeted for redistribution. The real story here is how a demagogue like Mugabe, who manufactures racial hatred for his own political gain, can be so disrespectful of the very principles that he espoused to obtain power in the first place.For those who think that the land reform issue is a simple matter of taking from the rich and giving to the poor, it may be quite a shock to learn that the only ones benefiting so far from newly acquired farmland are Mugabe's wealthy political cronies. Everyone else is on the verge of starvation due to the inevitable collapse of the economic infrastructure following the demise of the rule of law.The rest of the world stood by and watched it happen. Perhaps someday we'll realize that it's far more humanitarian and cost-efficient to prevent famines before they occur.

I was blown away--goosebumps every other minute, and the production detail is stunning. This seems to be one of those recordings that is somewhat dependent on the quality of stereo it is played on. Sounds crazy, but I really believe it. Sounds not so good on the JVC bookshelf stereo, crappy in the Chrysler, SWEET in the Audi, and stellar on the B&W;'s, the latter of which gave me a total body-rush when I played Azul at high volume.The Bottom Line: if you are a Bebel fan, you will buy this. If you're new to Bebel, I'd say start with Tanto Tempo or the Tanto Tempo Remixes. If your favorite music is Top 40 bubblegum pop, turn around and don't look back.

review/text: Never before do I remember reading a book that has so moved me as did Jean M. Auel's CLAN OF THE CAVE BEAR. I had always seen it, heard of it, but somehow never got around to actually sitting down and reading its pages. The decision to read CLAN OF THE CAVE BEAR was one that I could never regret. While reading it I cheered silently for Ayla, cried visibly for her, and was angry when injustices fell on her. Reading this novel was like visiting another world, allowing me to escape everyday life to live in the past. I was terribly sad when I had finished the last page, but look forward to continuing the series.In the beginning I was skeptic about the quality, but as I continued reading I found that the quality was the highest of any book I have ever read. The details were so descriptive that I could see the cave, the landscape, the people... so much that they became real to me. This novel is not only a great piece of fiction but a world all in its own. I could actually relate to the characters in the book, namely Ayla. I felt her will and determination, and most of all her willingness to sacrfice herself for anything that was important to her. Well done, Ms. Auel, you have created a superb piece of literature.

review/text: Michael O'Shea is surviving a bittersweet summer; the untimely death of his father has sent him spiraling into a grief that only prayer seems to quell, and at the behest of his maternal uncle his family is urged to leave the familiarity and comfort of their Philadelphia home to heal in rural Kentucky. There the only comfort is found in the welcoming smiles and hospitality of strangers, as Michael learns his mother's brother's family are staunch &quot;Bible-believing&quot; folk who choose to live as &quot;plain&quot; people. Socializing among the Amish of that region, Michael's extended family's existence is founded upon a lack of material wants and needs and an abundance of faith.Gradually Michael and his family come to relax and enjoy the company of their relatives. Creature comforts fade into memory, for playing a game of baseball and tucking into homemade ice cream on the front porch appears to yield more enjoyment than a night in front of the television. However, Michael senses something amiss, particularly every time his uncle brings up issues of faith and challenges the boy to validate his own beliefs. As if dealing with the death of his father was not enough to bear, Michael soon realizes his uncle's ulterior motive for bringing his family to Kentucky -- to persuade Michael's mother of the error she made in converting to Catholicism by first converting her children to his beliefs. Michael, a lukewarm student of his own Catholic faith, is suddenly shocked to hear people dismiss the Catholic Church as &quot;pagan&quot; and &quot;unChristian.&quot;Explanations outside of actual Bible quotes (KJV version, mind you) fall upon deaf ears, and Michael is self-propelled into a crash course in apologetics, with only the Bible and the prayers of his mother to sustain him. As Michael prepares to successfully defend the Faith against the local nay-sayers, many of whom know much of the Bible by heart, his confidence grows, and it is his knowledge of the faith through God's Word which helps establish an atmosphere of tolerance which some in this tight-knit community are more willing to embrace than others.Like the works of Bud MacFarlane, Jr., Kennedy's &quot;Philadelphia Catholic&quot; is a teaching novel, an apologetics tool in the guise of an engaging coming-of-age story. Kennedy's eye for detail is evident in his descriptions of Amish country and portrayals of life among the &quot;plain&quot; people, and Michael's dialogue and evangelization is well woven into Kennedy's prose. Kennedy delivers the facts of the faith without making it sound as if the &quot;Philadelphia Catholic&quot; is regurgitating lines from a textbook; the reader should not feel as if he/she is being lectured, and considering the tense climactic scene where Michael faces his challengers as a witness standing trial, Kennedy should be commended for a plausible conclusion to the story. With &quot;Philadelphia Catholic&quot; Kennedy leaves us to decide the validity of the Catholic faith, and through Michael O'Shea he offers convincing arguments bracketed by a touching story.

review/text: The American consumer public are no fools. We know how to spend our dollars wisely, where to invest and what to avoid. So when this Francis Lawrence-helmed apocalyptic "thriller" topped weekend box office charts during its initial release, there's no way that money could've been directed towards the wrong feature, right?Yes and no. Let's start with the yes and get it over with. First off, very impressive visual effects. From the exorcism in the beginning of the movie, to our little hero's ventures into hell, to the wings of Gabriel. (Btw, it is very interesting to note how Gabriel is depicted as genderly ambiguous) Rachel Weisz has a very smooth way to her acting, as if she can do it so easily and flawlessly, you actually believe her character as an L.A. policewoman haunted by the mysterious death of her twin sister. Shia Laboeuf has a bit of a minor role, but he makes the most of it, shining with that unintended humor of his character, Constantine's "slave" chaffeur, Chas Kramer.Now, the no part. Hollywood seems to love declaring Keanu Reeves as our savior, the hero who didn't want to be a hero, called upon to save the world in one way or another. Whether it be in the machine-run era of "The Matrix", or a police officer trying to stop a madman from doing terrorist deeds in "Speed." And now, again, Reeves is called upon to save us from a clash between heaven and hell! John Constantine, a reluctant hero who has selfish ends, feeling sorry for himself, blah blah... Reeves may or may not put his all into this role, but as we all know by now, his best is never good enough. Constantine's persona is too flat, not captivating enough, further brought down by that annoying monotone drawl of Reeves' voice, and constantly needs support from the other characters in the film. Even the 20-second flashbacks of his childhood we see aren't enough to garner attention or pity for this soul branded for hell.The worst of it is that we expect this hero to maintain and carry along what little plot there is, stretched out over 2 hours. Honestly, folks, there is not much going on here. The filmmakers probably made about 5 storyboards and decided to make each one 20 minutes long. Inbetween the grueling beginning and the much-anticipated end, there's a whole lot of nothing eye-candy that manages to transfix into a bit of something, but not enough. Somehow we get from the death of a psychiatric patient to the end of the world...? And even when the movie's over, there's STILL unanswered questions. I don't mean, "Oh, will Angela and John get together?" nonsense but "Uh what happened to the dead sister??" No doubt saving for an equally painful sequel.So don't waste your money on this over-budgeted Keanu-promoting campaign...oh, oh I mean, thriller! "The Seventh Seal," "12 Monkeys," good flicks. Not this. No.

review/text: The starting point and first dot is Orwell's 1984 how language is used to control large populations. The second dot connects Big Brothers tactics to modern politics and business. Hmm, Big Brother could have written the American 2001Patriot act himself. The Last but not lease dot is connecting the 1984 dots to Americas "race" problem.Do you know who and what land area they were fighting over in 1984? Most experts think that Orwell was writing about totalitarian government. He was, but that was not all he was writing about. Big Brother and Oceania were trying to get control of a particular land, and its people, and resources. Where was this land? If you read the book, I bet you do not remember. You read the answer, it was at the end of the book. When you read it, your bio-computer (Brain) had a Brain Crash. Because what Orwell reveals in the end is so well connected to modern times and what is actually happening, today it is too scary to contemplate for most Americans.Yes and today we have the Patriot Act, and Neighbors who become part of the "disappeared". Hmmmm!You need these particular dots, You need to reread these classics, Orwell is not as theoretical as you think.For more details, get DoubleSpeak in Black and White here on Amazon

review/text: I think that this is probally the best CD I have ever heard. I dont care what the other critics say, Clay has AMAZING talent and I'm glad that he is doing SO well. I think that my favorite song on the album is &quot;MEASURE OF A MAN&quot;. I liked this song because he sings it like he actually means what he is saying(and I'm sure he does). I also like it because it is just so different from the rest of the songs on the CD and that makes it really unique and fun to listen to. I think that my least favorite song on the CD is &quot;WHEN YOU SAY YOU LOVE ME&quot;. Clay seems to me like a slow song or somewhat up-tempo kinda guy, he doesn't seem like a somewhat fast song kinda guy and &quot;WHEN YOU SAY YOU LOVE ME&quot; is a somewhat fast song. It really is a great song, but it's NOT Clay. Overall the CD was GREAT and I would reccomend it to everyone. There is something in the CD for EVERYONE!!! I'd give it 7 stars out of 5, if I could!!!!!

review/text: Like anyone else reading this, I am a huge Barbra fanand have been since I first saw the "Funny Girl" movie.For 40 years I've been thrilled, amused, moved, occasion-ally disappointed, charmed, and awed by her talent.I saw her in concert in 1994 at Madison Square Garden,and it was one of the concert thrills of my life. Hervoice still had such power and magnificence, and toexperience it as it actually emanated from her vocalcords and into my ears was just a dream come true.After that I never tried to get tickets to see heragain because I knew it could never be better thanthat time. BUT, listening to this CD, I regretnot going to see her last year. Is her voice better?Absolutely not. As has been discussed in the otherreviews, there are signs of aging that you simplycannot hide. A bit of huskiness in the lower regis-ter, and those once-effortless high notes requirea lot more effort. There is simply no comparing thepower of her voice 30 years ago with the way shesounds now. HOWEVER, I think we need to focus onwhat her voice still IS. It is still a beautifulinstrument, more expressive than most other singersout there. That lush Streisand tone has only gottenricher, IMHO. Such a sound! And what Mother Naturehas diminished has been more than made up for bythe grace, humor and sublime interpretive skillsthat Barbra displays now, as much as ever...maybe more.I wasn't prepared to be so moved by this recording.It sounds like she's having the time of her life, andthe song selection includes many songs she hasn'tsung in years. The humor and brass of "Down With Love"and the bittersweet regret of "Have I Stayed TooLong At The Fair" are just two highlights. (I thinkher special guests Il Divo are dreadful, but whatever.)I also think that this version of "The Way We Were" isby far her best live one. After all these years, tobreathe new meaning into that old warhorse....well,that's what we call "art". If you're expecting the"Broadway Album" voice, you may be disappointed. Butif you want to hear a singer so alive and geniune thatit will give you a lump in your throat, buy this.It's a keeper. A+!!

review/text: Michael Barone is the co-creator (with Grant Ujifusa) of the Almanac of American Politics, itself an almost inexhaustible well of the curious and (sometimes) interesting. Our Country is an effort to put the same sensibility to work in a narrative history. Barone has absorbed a lot and forgotten little, and he likes to remind the reader of things others are more likely to forget. Civil rights, for example. One wing of the Republican party had its roots planted firmly in the abolitionist movement, dating back to before the Civil War. You could call it &quot;the Eisenhower wing,&quot; if you were clear that it did not include Eisenhower. As general, and later as president, it seems fair to say that Eisenhower just didn't get it - not so much hostility to blacks as a kind of blank incomprehension - why weren't they willing to keep the place (one is tempted to make comparisons with General Sherman). Lyndon Johnson, by contrast, is one who emphatically did get it. Vulnerable and insecure as he always saw himself, Johnson was able to show real empathy for the plight of American Blacks. So we have the kind of irony so familiar in politics - the soldier-statesman who didn't get it, imposing a civil rights bill on Congress against the best efforts of the cracker politician who did.Barone obviously relishes the irony there, but he likes the story in particular because of an even more consistent enthusiasm. That is: he is fascinated by the hard work of governing, which he comes close to glamorizing in its very unglamorousness. You can see it perhaps best in his appreciative account of a man who he nominates as a forgotten progenitor of modern social legislation - Robert Wagner, the senator and father, inter alia, of the Wagner Labor Relations Act. Without Wagner, as Barone tells it, the New Deal's legislative agenda would have been a lot more insipid. It perhaps explains also his affection for Hubert Humphrey - a name perhaps mostly forgotten today, or remembered if at all only in the sour aftertaste of the 1968 presidential election, which he lost to Richard Nixon.What perhaps gives zest to Barone's account is that for all his skill as a data-miner, he believes at the end that politics is culture and not economics that divides us or draws us together. It impels him to insist that there is a society more important than its contentions and divisions, more than the sum of its parts - in some sense, a res publica, or (back to Barone's title here) &quot;Our Country.&quot; Only one afterthought: this is another book that cries out for an new edition.

review/text: When I heard Larry Ellison the world's second richest man was involved, I had to go see this movie. Expecting great things. ORACLE sized greatness. Instead don't be fooled by the 4,5 star ratings people give this movie. What a load of rubbish! I expected an action movie - great fights - true war. Not a romance set in a very serious war. The lead actor is terrible. Sorry they cast too young an actor. It wasn't interesting. The only interesting actor was the guy with the lion. The rest I can't even remember. All I will remember from this movie was the zepplin exploding and the funeral where they mention that the guy with the lion was an atheist and that he didn't care much about religion anyway. So that is it - a true waste of money. And these second rate actors and kiddie script writers are getting rich from hype.

It may disillusion some of us who are laboring under the belief that we are "hereditary witches" or that modern witchcraft has a unified and unbroken heritage that extends back into pre-history. But for the truly dedicated Wiccan who has a hunger to understand and follow the historical threads, this is the book to read. If you still want to pursue Magic of any sort after you finish this book, then you will embrace the Call as a well-informed practitioner rather than just a game-player or poser.

However, being an experienced groundfighter, I must say that his ground escapes are weak. But it's not his fault. I'm sure he included it just as an afterthought, and GF were not popular by the time he wrote this book. It's very good that he included it on this book, considering that most other Jujitsu teachers omits ground moves on their books.

review/text: I recently received a Fuji Finepix F601 as a gift; the giver, a professional photographer, included a Fuji 128MB Smart Media Card as a matter of course. Thank goodness he knew what he was doing in terms of storage needs, at least -- the 601 only comes with a 16MB card, which on the 601 is only enough for 5 images at the highest recording level. If you're getting a compatible Fuji, Olympus, or other-brand camera, you really need the highest storage card possible.But it turns out these cards are fragile, and fingerprints can short them out or cause problems with the camera or reader being able to access their contents. So the best way to keep them around forever is to get a 128 MB card and never remove it! Ideally, then, this should be a solution coupled with the purchase or ownership of a camera which interfaces directly (USB or firewire) with the PC, so there won't be a need to remove the card. Ever. That security, and the ability to store over a hundred 8x10 print-quality pix on one wafer-thin card, makes the bigger sized card easily worth the extra cost if you're getting a Fuji or other-brand digital camera.As for brand...well, after trying a Fuji and a Viking card, and checking the wiring stats on both, it turns out the brand names of Smart Cards have almost nothing to do with quality (with the exception of one minor function on Olympus cameras which only Olympus cards do). These are, for all intents and purposes, interchangable -- so buying the cheapest one out there is the best bet. And, although amazon.com inexplicably doesn't include rebate savings when listing card costs unless you're looking at the actual page for the actual product, with rebates, the Viking card IS the cheapest Smart Media brand on the market -- by a factor of about 10% or more. With no complaints and lots of joyful picture taking happening in my house, I therefore give SimpleTech five stars for the basic product...but take away one star for a higher cost. Sorry, SimpleTech.

Although not the most uplifting, it is a great example of Hardy and Deterministic and Naturalistic fiction. Despite Tess' best efforts (like Jude in the other Hardy novel), she is unable to escape the poverty and misfourtune which she attempts to leave behind. Although somewhat lengthy, the novel is one of the better pieces of British fiction to come out of the period.

review/text: I was a bit tenative about writing this review lest the world know our secret - and then they'd all have one too. We were looking for something to put under our PD170 and stumbled upon this beauty.The construction quality is solid and as a unit the tripod is stable. The fluid head panning is just about as good I could expect. Smooth and steady. The tripod shoe is nice and has a cork pad to protect the bottom of your camera.The tripod would be a good buy for just its basic features, but what sets it apart is the LANC remote control built into the handle. Its great. LANC (or Control-L) compatable cameras are made by Sony (this is a Sony product) and Canon and some others.On the handle you have a On/Standy switch, a Record button, a Photo button, and a Zoom rocker. For the stuff we've done so far its super. I can keep my hands on the handle get the shots I want.The remote control makes the makes using the camcorder on the tripod a slick experience.The only thing that would make this a better deal is if they added a Focus Control to the remote. As far as usage - the only other issue is it took a while to get a feel for how much to tighten the tilt knob to lock it down - i didn't want to over-torque it and break something and didn't want the camera slowly moving either - but once you get the feel its fine.This tripod is a good buy. But don't feel like you have to run out and get one. We like being the only cool and geeky ones.

When you see the poor publicity Fonda has gotten recently because she's upset about the latest war, remember too, that you need to see her films and read her autobiography. She is brilliant.She's been there; done that. She deserves great recognition for this wonderful, valid, strong, creative experience of her brave, yet scared character here. She and Redgrave portray the best of intellectuals. And lately, intellectuals seem to be forgotten by the movie business. Here is a saga, a journey, worthy of high praise. Doesn't anyone miss the wonderful historic dramas of times past? This is one, with acting worthy of acclaim.

review/text: I was excited when I found this book, not only because I had watched Saturday night live for as long as I can remember, but I was eager to learn what went on behind the scenes. And I received more than I bargained for, in all good ways. The great thing about this book is it is told by the cast, writers, producers, and NBC executives. It is from their mouths. It isnt rumored tales or reporters speculating. Of course there are different opinions and feelings, but for the most part, all the cast members seem to have the same feelings. They feel a brotherhood to eachother. When you watch the show, and see the sketches, one believes these people are just having a grand old time, and you dont realize how much is involved until you read this. It starts back in 75 with the original cast members, those who are still alive, talking about what it was like. Drugs involved, pressures, etc. It goes over deaths of Gilda Radner, Jon Belushi, Phil Hartman and Chris Farrley. Almost all the cast memebers ever on the show speak in this book, with the exception of Eddie Murphy who, for some reason doesnt want to be any part of Saturday night live, even though thats what made him. For most of the cast members SNL was their platform to stardom. There also is alot of bitterness present, as with Janeane Garafalo. Most of all the cast members and the writers feel pretty much the same about Lorne Michaels, the exucutive producer. He is the creator and the father figure. They all greatly seek his approval, which is scarce. But most look back at him in kindness.It is a great read, soooooo much information you would never have known otherwise. I really thought this would be one of those books that would last me a while and I looked forward to that, but because you know so many of the cast and are so interested in the words from their own mouth, you really cant put it down. Dont pass this one by!!

review/text: Silone's communist message is outdated.More, he makes the cardinal error to believe that solidarity is a basic human characteristic: 'Bread is made of many grains of corn, wine is made of many grapes, so it means unity. Unity of similar, equal, useful things. Hence truth and fraternity are also things that go well together.'But, man shows only solidarity if there is a 'personal' gain. Pure altruism is absolutely no option in the struggle for survival.His picture of mankind is static, too rosy and naive. His belief in the proletariat is obsessive: 'the poor are uncontaminated by greed for property.' Hence, he proposes the abolishing of private ownership of land.'Evil is only everything that prevents millions of people from becoming human.' For Silone, evil is not a basic and intrinsic part of the human character.He doesn't understand that all proletarians want their children to become (not static) doctors, engineers, lawyers, economists ..., in other words 'bourgeois'.In Stalin's Soviet Union, he sees only a fraternity of peasants and workers.The political role of the Catholic Church nowadays is marginalized. In Italy, they even don't have a Christian Party anymore.Of course, the main character poses certain questions: had that (communist) community not itself become a synagogue? abandoned the critical spirit? the risks of conspirational struggles?His answer is no. He refutes that the communists aspire too to totalitarian power and orthodoxy and that a black inquisition will be followed by a red one. His return to his homeland 'had been basically an attempt to escape that professionalism', and he has the 'hope of one day playing a big role'.Like a fanatically convinced Christian missionary, he tries desperately to sell his communist gospel to the poor cafoni. Unfortunately, they are terribly conservative ('it has always been so') and his message falls on deaf ears.What is left in this book are the struggles against a totalitarian (here fascist) regime and against the butchery of war.It is partly very melodramatic (e.g. the confession at the end) and its main symbolism (a marxist apostle disguised as a priest) irrealistic.I prefer Silone's more direct and less apostolical 'Fontamara' and recommend highly his masterpiece 'Emergency Exit'.

review/text: I bought this to supplement an aging Salton Hot Spot model. The Salton worked okay, but I needed a second warmer. Unfortunately, the Mr Coffee produces disappointing results. Hot coffee becomes warm coffee on this unit. Being a forensic engineer, I was prompted to do some testing to determine what might be the problem.Both units were tested unloaded (i.e. with no cup), and then loaded with a ceramic mug filled with room temp water. Here are the stats:Salton: 23 watts, 260 deg-F unloaded temp, 245 degree with full cup.Mr. Coffee: 17 watts, 226 deg-F unloaded, 180 degree with full cup.So it appears that the Mr Coffee is a bit underpowered--it has a lower (albeit safer) starting temperature that can't be maintained under load. Once loaded, the surface temp is too low for useful heat transfer. Perhaps the Salton's design was guided by an engineer, while the Mr Coffee was guided by an attorney.

review/text: This film is a treasure if you need to laugh, and want to laugh at how crazy most humans are. In viewing this film recently, I better understood what great comic and great actor Dudley Moore was. I miss him.Rex Harrison acted in the original version of this story. Dudley made the film so much more funny. By seeing both versions you can why Dudley was a comic genius. I miss him. Dudley makes clear what screwballs we humans are. And he takes ordinary script lines and makes them very funny. Many of the elements of a Shakespearean comedy are in this film, but unlike the plays, this film has a terrific music score, has beautiful photography, and has simple dialogue. What makes this film great, for those mature enough to understand it, is Dudley Moore. I am not sure, but, to me, the concert hall looks very much like the one at the California Institute of Technology.This film is a remake of the much earlier black-and-white version, and the remake, unlike most remakes, is superior to the original.

However, it was always a chore because she would pull me along & by the end of the walk my hand would have blisters & be numb. I tried everything including halters that pulled, etc. Nothing worked. I got a Halti size 1 & it was a little bit big (about an inch or so), so I just snugged it up & pinned it with the sewing machine. So now it fits her perfectly. Her walks were much improved, but it did not completely eliminate the pulling-- but it did make the pulling tolerable.I got an empty plastic spice jar & filled it 1/4 full with coins. I bring it on our walks. When she begins to pull, I shake it once. She will stop. Then she'll pull again & I will shake. After about 3 or 4 times, she will completely heel on the walks! It is amazing! So between the shake jar & the Halti, I can happily take my Jack Russell on a casual walk.Kira

Through a red cat named Buddy he explores Hobo songs, miners and union songs, the fight for civil rights and dignity. And then there is a brief re-occuring theme of a space ship landing at an opportune time...It comes complete with a beautifully illustrated book about Buddy's travels with his friends and acts as a footnote to the songs. It is a simple premise and obviously a labor of love beautifully executed and is not for the hard of heart. This is front porch music with old friends the likes of Flaco Jimenez and Paddy Malone. We need more people in our lives like Ry Cooder.

review/text: BALONEYI'm glad the overall rating for this film is 4 stars. I say, Baloney, to the nitpickers. This is a very, very fine film that treats both the facts and the book upon which this film is based with accuracy and sensitivity. There's nothing wrong with the long final scene with Patton talking non-stop while lying in a hospital bed. In some ways, that is more about the true Patton than the image of him barking out orders. This death scene, in my view, is an achievement in biographical film making. True, some facts in the film were softened, such as Ike's chastisements of Patton, turning the final interview into an austere reprimand rather than the catalysimic destruction of a friendship that it was. And Patton was secretly under observation for signs of psychopathology (good thing our Civil War generals didn't live in the 20th Century!) And Patton was a lot more disgusted with the European Jews--and a lot chummier with the German Regular Army officers, than depicted in the film, but these facts are suggested in the film. And I feel that all of this is okay. Generally speaking, this genre is watched by history buffs, anyway, and we can fill in the blanks. We should all know by now that there's only so much you can do with a two-hour movie. I'll never forget the scene of Patton's wife in a powder blue dress and floppy hat test-driving a prototype tank in front of the mossback Cavalry Generals. By the way, Scott was 42 years old when he performed in the original PATTON. General Patton himself was between ages 59 to 60 during WW2. In this present film, Scott is the same age as Patton was. Good film. Well done.

There is little wood working technique described so if you are looking for a how-to book, this ain't the book for you.

review/text: One of the best books I have read is Aldous Huxley's 'Island'. It is a take-off on the utopia theme and not his first one on it, the earlier one being 'The Brave New World'. His 'The Brave New World' was a brilliant trenchant satire, written on the premise that the human race has only two alternatives viz. being either insane or lunatic. 'The Brave New World' was a fantasy fable. 'Island' published in 1962, 30 years after 'Brave New World' was written by a much mellowed Huxley. Huxley's premise had changed from the earlier one. He believed that humanity had a third choice, of being sane. 'Island' is no satire, less fable like, the socio-political, economic system exposited in it is less fable like, and though might seem very difficult to realize, is not impossible if we all manage to be sane!Pala is a tiny (fable) island in the Indian Ocean, where it's small community has made the best of western and eastern worlds. The inhabitants are basically Shivaite-Buddhists. They have adopted the western technology but not to the extent that the technology becomes dehumanizing and prevents them being full human beings. They have steered clear of the three pillars of the western prosperity:- armaments, universal debt and planned obsolescence. They have of course their tradition of empathy for all the living beings, their respect for the environment, habitat and the practice of their traditional mind science. The Community believes that God is immanent, man is potentially transcendent. The island's enlightened community have attempted the enormous folly of trying to make a marriage between Hell and Heaven and succeeded at it. They have blended their tradition with western technology in a perfect synthesis. Rather, one of their prime credo is making the best of all the worlds.The book opens in a dramatic fashion. An English journalist on a secret mission to push the Oil interests of his tycoon boss is regaining consciousness an early morning on the fable island Pala. He had the previous afternoon procured a boat at the neighboring island (a separate country) and planned to sail into the Pala harbor. Unfortunately, he gets caught in a squall. Instead of sailing into the Pala harbor, he is washed ashore the wrong side of the Island with steep hills to be negotiated to reach habitation. Even as he is descending in the failing light of dusk, negotiating the slippery rain washed rocks, he espies snakes (not necessarily venomous) slithering around. Probably finding live snakes around for the first time in his life, he panics, loses hold and falls. Fortunately for him, this fall to the ground is cushioned by an obstructing tree. Still badly bruised, shaken and utterly terrified he loses consciousness. He regains consciousness the next morning with two Palanese urchins - a ten year old girl and a four year old boy- solicitously looking down upon him. The girl sends off the boy to get help. Meanwhile she feeds the famished journalist with bananas. The journalist is still carrying the phantom images of the slithering snakes though they are no more around. How the ten year old successfully administers therapy to the adult journalist to rid of the snakes crawling in his mind is one of the high points of the novel!One of the other high points in the novel: - the character Lakshmi, in last dying stages of terminal cancer is treated by her relatives. Death is treated as any other incident in life. It is as if Lakshmi's relatives are seeing her off for a long journey she is undertaking. She is helped in every way to live to the very fullest even as she is dying. Huxley had been deeply influenced by the book 'The Tibetan Book of the Dead' so popular in the west during 1920s & 1930s. This particular episode seems to have been inspired by 'The Tibetan Book of the Dead'.Huxley concludes the book on somewhat tragic but realistic note.

review/text: This book does not remind me of anything I have read before. It looks a way more professional than most for these types of books. It has a very workable plan to produce the best results in the smallest of spaces to big basement grows if you want. The strategies are clearly laid out and explained in sufficient detail. Readers can find plenty of pictures, diagrams and illustrations with instructions. It is very motivational. The clear and easy writing style should appeal to anybody. Good luck.

review/text: I grew up on these books and the biggest part of their allure and charm was the nightmarish and frightening artwork by Stephen Gammell. I am EXTREMELY disappointed that they are being re-drawn with a washed out and flowered up style. Please take my advice and buy the original, it is definitely worth it, I promise. I think it is sad that some children will never know the original drawings because parents are too uptight and make a big fuss about them. Too sad. They are SUPPOSED to be scary, you know?

review/text: Adam Sandler always makes me laugh very easily. I've seen most of his movies(Big Daddy,Mr.Deeds,The Waterboy,)and now Eight Crazy Nights which I have been looking forward to for a little while. The movie is not just laughs but also has a heartwarming style apart from it's constant crude humor. Adam Sandler doesn't just play one voice in the film but three. Also doing voices are Jon Lovitz,and Tara Banks. The bad part of the movie is that it is a little too short. They moved from when the main character was bad and then the next scene he's good. They could have shown what happened in that interval of time between his moods.The film is about Davey Stone(Adam Sandler) who used to be a great nice kid. Davey isn't the greatest person and gets drunk often and is overall not a nice person. His life changes when he rips up a bill in a resturant and rips the guy off. He gets sent to court and is about to be sentenced when Whitey Durvall(Adam Sandler)tells the judge that he could be a ref in training for the youth basketball leaque and Whitey's partner. The movie spans through the eight days of Hankukaa and also how Davey has to change his life with the help of Whitey. Whitey's story is how he is trying to win a patch for the person in the town who has contributed the most. The patch has been running for 35 years and Whitey has not won once.The movie has tons of crude and sexual jokes. In fact every single joke is crude but the movie is still funny and gets my recomendation.ENJOY!

review/text: Very interesting to see that the most ratings for the Jorion book are either 5 stars or 1 star. I have no idea why one should rate this book with 5 stars - but so many reasons why to rate it with one star:- it is full of errors- it is written in a very strange and unstructured fashion- it is difficult to read- Explanations are poor- the layout is horrible (the 80ies do-it-yourself desktop publishing style)Unfortunately, this is the major book for the FRM exam - some questions will relate to some irrelevant footnotes from the Jorion book for sure.... So a lot of people studying for the exam will continue to waste a lot of time with this book....Once upon a time, a guy called Phillipe J. wrote a book about Value at Risk at exactly the right moment and became famous. Since then, people like to ask him to hold presentations at conferences (his charts there have the same quality as the charts in the book, his presentation techniques are extremely disappointing), they like to publish his papers (well, probably comparable to the quality of the book), they like to ask him to be on the board for important exams like the FRM exam. Probably this was all too much...

review/text: I will never understand how "Classics" become Classics. So far for school i Have had to read far to many Classics. Dickens should be glad he is dead and does not have to read his books because they would probably kill him out of sheer boredom...Hawthorne creates an ok tale, but really? It gets dragged out and is suppose to be realistic. Then he throws Pearl in there, she is like some super-human and belongs in fantasy. I never really did believe in the whole 'they completely ostracized her but let her stitch everything.' That is just a bit hypocritical, either she was excepted as prat of the society *which she was not) or she wasn't (which she almost was. See that just doesn't make any sense. The story is suppose to show how unforgiving the society was, but it doesn't. It is better than Dickens, but then again everything is.

review/text: FLAHOOLEY has had a checkered career in record company catalgues. The musical was a flop that folded after 5 weeks (40 performances) in the spring of 1951. Capitol records issued the cast album on June 18th ..2 days after the show had played its final performance. With the show no longer playing, interest was minimal and the Lp was deleted in 1955. Since very few copies had been sold, collectors who wanted the score had a difficult time tracking down the album. By the early 1970s its estimated value in collectors circles was $300. Finally in 1977...22 years after the album had left the catalogues, Capitol brought it back. A mid-priced ($6.98) reissue that duplicated the original album cover. The reissue was short-lived, for beyond harcore show music collectors there was no mass market for FLAHOOLEY and the Lp was deleted again.In 1993 EMI launched a major Cd reissue campaign called Broadway Angel transferring 40 of the Capitol cast albums to CD, including FLAHOOLEY. This time the liner notes were expanded to include a history of the show, a detailed synopsis and an interview with Barbara Cook.The CD again was bought mainly by collectors and was deleted in 1996. You would think that after 3 go-rounds, this would have been the end of FLAHOOLEY. But Noooooooooo... now DRG has brought it back.The score by Sammy Fain and Ey.Y Harburg has several charming numbers: &quot;Here's to your Illusions&quot;, &quot;The World is Your Balloon&quot;and &quot;The Springtime Cometh.&quot; None of the songs became hits, and FLAHOOLEY is never revived... not even in concert format.Don't miss out on a chance to own a copy of FLAHOOLEY before it gets deleted for the 4th and final (?) time.

review/text: that I have read Till We Have Faces. What an amazing book. Lewis had an uncanny knack for reaching in and grabbing hold. I must admit I started reading this book and couldn't stop. It made me feel a little bit like I was drowning, but I think it was wonderful excercise for my mind. I have so long been reading what is passing for Christian fiction that my brain had become numb. What a wonderful way to brush away the cobwebs and really dig in to something substantial. It made me uncomfortable to a degree, like something that hits just a little to close to home. Greedy, all-consuming, self-centered love at the expense of others, or worse at the expense of those you are supposed to love best. Ouch. I am a Lewis fan now and ever more.

review/text: Its been a long time coming, and now that Garage Inc. is finally here, the big question is, does it stink. The answer; Yes and No. The second disc, a compilation of every cover recorded by the band between 1984 and 1995, displays the bands obvous love for NWOBHM groups like Motorhead and Diamond Head, as well as punks like the misfits. If there is a complaint about this disc, its the sound quality. Instead of going back digitally remastering tracks like &quot;The Prince&quot; and &quot;Breadfan&quot;, as well as the 4 Motorhead covers, which were never properly produced, the band have simply thrown the originals on the cd, complete with dodgy sound quality. Overall, the second CD earns 4 stars The first Cd, on the other hand, is vintage Bob Rock-produced, slick sounding, 90's metallica. This Cd also contains a more schizophrenic range of songs, form very non-metal artist like Bob Seger and Nick Cave, thru to vintage 70's hard rock like BOC and Black Sabbath. The verdict-3 stars The most obvious diferences between the two discs are Hammetts solos and the sound quality. disc 1 doesn't contain one good solo, and is instead full of... Load-style... poor attempts at branching that simply dont work. The second disc, however, is chock full of 80's hammett at his best

review/text: The same comments I wrote on the sister disc to this Marco Polo release (Ulalume, Bronwen, The Bells etc.) go for this one but with one big difference. On the first CD for Holbrooke's Orchestral Works we had over 71 minutes music whereas here we have just over 46 minutes. It seems that Marco Polo decided to cheapskate us captive purchasers who they know will always pay full price for any rare collection of English Music which is unavailable elsewhere. The works here are all 'bleeding orchestral chunks' from Holbrooke's Welsh legend trilogy and are beautifully played and recorded throughout. The Birds of Rhiannon is a very serious substantial tone poem and the fluttering birds music, played as Bronwen dies in the arms of Caradoc in his opera, is very evocative. The Children of Don and Dylan both contain much beautiful music, revealing a lyrical gift as well as an ability to build up tension by the use of horns and brass, backed by heavy percussion. It is all good. I just wish that Marco Polo could have been a little more generous with the spare 25-30 minutes capacity on this CD and provided the starved public with some more rarities from this neglected composer. However, we have to take the rough with the smooth (in coloquial English: we mustn't grumble) and if you love this kind of music, just buy it and keep smiling! After all, at least this stuff on the CD is now available...lose one star though.

review/text: Deconstruction is a deceptively useful philosophical device. However, this usefulness is severely limited. Deconstruction can present no positive conclusions. All it can do is show the fallibility of any attempt at such certain knowledge, primarily by exposing the inadequacy of language, a faculty so intimately connected with understanding. As a skeptic, I personally find deconstuction to be very pleasing. However, I am constantly annoyed by Derrida's insistance on frequently ignoring this aspect of his process. As a philosopher, I suppose the inclination to make some sort of positive assertion could be irresitible. I love the "play" and the analysis, but the attempt at ethical conclusions leaves me cold.In "The Gift of Death," Derrida uses the story of Abraham and Isaac to distinguish between an absolute responsibility to "the other" from the typical ethical, "known" responsibility. I have never understood why it is that philosophers use this parable and others to decipher ethical realities. How much truth can one expect to extract from a fictional story? However, the idea that originary responsibility is always irresponsible is intriguing. Derrida proposes that Abraham's responsibility to God, the other, takes precedence over his lesser responsibilty to his son. And yet, later he makes the assertion that every other is an absolute other, making all responsibility absolute.All of this emphasis on otherness ultimately leads to a kind of ethical paralysis, but Derrida does not acknowledge this. Throughout history, small differences have been blown up into impenetrable divisions. Racism, homophobia, sexism, ethnicity, nationality, religion, all the institutions that Deconstruction usually attacks are fully supported by these "irresponsible" ethical conclusions.As I said before, the analysis reads like poetry and there are some very interesting ideas here. Derrida is frustrating, but worthwhile. I recommend this as well as "Writing and Difference."

review/text: Ultimately, the hardest decision about the Foundation books is to decide how to read them. Maybe I'm being ridiculous, but I think you will enjoy them more if you read them in the order they were written. If so, this is the second book. If you have not yet read Foundation, then you need to go back and do so before tackling this one.Your other choice is to read the prequels first, then go onto Foundation. In that case, this is the fourth book you should read.Whichever choice you make, don't read this book first.On the surface, Foundation and Empire will seem like an uninspired playing out of Hari Seldon's vision for the future. Ah! But there's much more happening, so pay attention. When you get to the end of the book, you may find you have missed the mainstream and will have to go back. Don't worry, almost everyone has that reaction.Asimov is a brilliant conceptual writer, but not someone who slaved over every word (in fact, he was famous for writing most of his many books in only 1 or 2 drafts, with little editing after that). This book begins to develop the full Foundation concept in all of its stunning beauty.In many ways, you will be reading this book from the eyes of the first Foundation. But that's the unimportant one. The real action is with the second Foundation. Be sure to keep that in mind.When you meet the Mule, don't think of him as an aberration but rather as an extension of today's potential. That will make the book more interesting for you.Many people find this book to be the least interesting one of the Foundation series. Let me warn you that reading this one will greatly increase your pleasure in the following books beginning with the Second Foundation (which is your next pleasant reading assignment).Enjoy this irresistible series!

review/text: Eric Arthur Blair, under the pen name of George Orwell, wrote 1984 because of his concern of the spread of communism. It is a dark, gothic look at what society could become if the spectre of communism led to totalitarianism. Essentially, it is a more graphic and adult version of his Animal Farm, with people. It is told by a nameless narrator who knows all the goings-on in the world of the future, and follows the life of a middle-aged citizen of Oceania, Winston Smith, who is an employee in the Ministry of Truth. 1984 is not plot-driven, nor is it based on character development (these aspects are still present, however). The primary focus of the book is the setting. We are given the world as it could have become in 1984. Of course, we are not in a situation like that, but the threat of such a situation is still present. This differentiates it from other books, although there is never a reason to dislike or fear something new before trying it. Orwell believed it to be the most effective way to explain the world of 1984, and I think it is effective. If the focus were on the characters or the plot, a high proportion of the messages would have to be interpreted, rather than explained in detail. Different interpretations could mean that certain events make no sense, and discussion would be difficult. Some people may have missed some meanings altogether. By explaining his 'apocalyptic' vision of the future in complete detail, Orwell is able to get the entirety of his message to his readers. Orwell is a very articulate and imaginative writer. The world he depicts is divided into three world powers - Oceania, Eastasia and Eurasia. The Party controls Oceania, the setting of the novel. Big Brother (a parallel to Napoleon from Animal Farm, or Stalin in real life) is at the apex of the social pyramid. He is the father-figure worshipped by the citizens. The Inner Party comprises 2% of the population, and the Outer Party 15%. The remainder consists of the dumb masses, or 'proles'. Any sign of unorthodoxy is dealt with swiftly and harshly by the Thought Police (a parallel to the dogs, the American secret service or Russian KGB). The telescreens that are planted in the walls receive and transmit information simultaneously. The Thought Police use these to keep their citizens under surveillance. Children are turned against their own parents through the use of spy camps and worship of Big Brother. 1984 is partially a look at how easily children can be manipulated and what happens when it goes wrong. Ironically, the people with the least intelligence are given the highest degree of freedom. They do not pose a threat. The chances of an uprising are non-existent because the proles believe anything they are told, and do not take material facts into consideration. Three of the Party's main slogans: 'War is Peace', 'Freedom is Slavery' and 'Ignorance is Strength' are swallowed without question by the majority of the population. The reasons for this, and how the Party pulls it off, are explained in detail later on. The Party was meticulous in its planning. Any totalitarian system requires a scapegoat. In Oceania, it is Emmanuel Goldstein (John Lenin), the subject of the Two Minutes Hate. The Brotherhood is the rebel group that follows Goldstein's teachings, and undermines the Party at any opportunity. The narrator shows us the thoughts that run through Winston's mind, and how he longs for freedom of thought. He meets the book's loveinterest, Julia, whom he disgusts at first glance and lusts after, due to his own failed marriage and her beauty. She wears a chastity scarf, symbolising her (supposed) contempt for sex, part of the reason for his lust - he believes he can never have her. The message here is the desire for that which is forbidden. He later learns that Julia is a rebel, but in a different way, &quot;only from the waist down&quot;, according to Winston. They find a secret hiding place without a telescreen, and are invited to join the Brotherhood by O'Brien. As it turns out, this is when their troubles truly begin. Orwell describes in detail how the Party came into power, its motives and its true objectives. The full implication and repercussions of these revelations are unfurled in the final riveting part of the novel. However, there are flaws in the exploration of the society. We are not given a sufficient view into the eyes of the older generation that lived through the Revolution. Winston only questions one old prole in a pub, and appeared to give up his inquiry too early. 1984 is a very mature book, and I would only recommend it to people who can grasp similar concepts. If the reader is too young, they may dismiss the book as boring. It may seem so at first, but the novel will make more sense with some thought and, possibly, subsequent readings. If you enjoyed Brave New World, you will enjoy 1984, and even if you didn't, you may still like it. This is a philosopher's book.

review/text: This film is artistic, more so than most other Van Sant films. By artistic I mean that if you don't have a great appreciation for film or Kurt Cobain, you probably won't understand why most reviews are sooo good.I basically wanted to say that this film reminds me of many Nirvana songs (mostly Something In The Way) because despite the pure simplicity, it impacts you in ways you've never been impacted before. The slow, repetitive nature of Blake compares to that of Kurt's songs. I think that Van Sant had this in mind while making the film because he uses film techniques that lead the viewer to their imagination which, in the case of this film, leads to pity and admiration.I love the film, but if you saw Elephant or Gerry (Van Sant's two films most resembing this one) and didn't quite like either and you aren't a big fan of Kurt Cobain, you should still see it!

I was annoyed and discouraged by what I had seen as 'play Christianity'. At a point when I was tired of 'religiousness' I read this book.It is awe-inspiring. It causes one to focus on the Christ in Christianity and presses the point that the focus should not be on one's goodness or the social values of the world, after one reasonably looks and considers the case for Christianity they will realize that it is true and real and that Christ might be trusted and that the sphere of religion isn't where my focus should be but that of Christ.A must read!

review/text: The Witch of Blackbird Pond was a very different book. I just don't think it was my kind of book.I guess, it was okay but it was not wonderful. I guess if you're into olden times, witch hunts, arguments, and "romance" I guess it would be fine, but it wasn't my favorite book.I'll just kinda give you a brief telling of what the book is about.It starts out that a girl named Kit is sailing from Barbados which is in the West Indies and is headed to stay with her Aunt and her family in Wethersfield, Connecticut. Then she just is really outof place. She has different customs and just doesn't fit in. Her uncle isn't glad she's there and neither are other important people in the township. It's kinda just a lot of mishaps and bad things happen to Kit. Then she befriends a "witch". It's just aboutr her I guess gaining trust and her beginning to fit in.The end was just kinda like "blah". It's just kinda like Kit falls of the face of the earth, although wshe does live "happily ever after". As most books do unless they're horrors.I think that i8f you just wanted to relax it wasn't a good book to read because you had to thyink about what you were reading. But I guess if you're uptight and like it in books where it says 'tis all the time and thee I guess TWOULD (he he he) be good for you. But if you want to go to sleep you could read it. It could be a good bedtime story.If you like the old New England Colony pompousness and stuffiness I think you'd enjoy this book. I think also if you like to hear about a character struggling through life and pretty much being tortured you'd very much enjoy it.

I find it to print slow but that is not a big deal with me. The print quality is amzing. I have to admit I was extremely skeptical when people told me that the picture quality was as good as pictures from a normal camera.Printers take up lot of think though. I must say the ink is not cheap. I don't print pictures that often becuase of the ink price. But honestly you could not tell the difference between something printed on this printer and a normal photo. The only possible upgrade I could think for this printer is borderless prints.

review/text: After having filmed two extremely challenging movies as Knife in the water and Repulsion, Rosemary's baby was the right movie for the right director by then.Roman Polanski directed with firm hand, this demanding film about the practice of witchcraft in New York City, where a very young and happily wife, is wishful for the success of his husband as a promising actor.But on the roads, he will not hesitate to emulate the fatidic traces of Faust and will deal his success for a very committing pact with Satan.But the film goes far beyond the horrid anecdote, it explores with sarcastic gaze, the fugacious and trivial atmosphere of the mid-class in those times of febrile agitation. And of course, it was the seminal seed for "The exorcist" years later.A dark, somber and intense film that - despite the elapsed years - still holds its shocking dramatic structure.

review/text: Books are dangerous. They're full of ideas that make people think about the world, feel passion, and perhaps act out. That's not good for society; it causes conflict, uprising, and interference with the status quo. People who read and think scare people who don't, so most citizens have happily given up the right to decide what to think about and now let the government fill their brains with constant loud mindless entertainment. This managed input has equalized society; nobody feels inferior to anyone else and there's no conflict anymore. Dull minds, constant entertainment, and conformity make society run smoothly.Guy Montag works as a fireman. He burns books at night while his wife sits in her parlor and listens to inane media shows at high volume. But Clarice, the teenager next door, is different. Her family sits around and talks. They discuss things and they laugh with each other. Guy wonders what they talk about as he watches his wife talk to the strangers on TV and pop sleeping pills...Ray Bradbury's Fahrenheit 451 presents a possible frightening future in which intellectual pursuits and nonconformity are deemed dangerous and subversive. It's been more than half a century since Fahrenheit 451 was published and we've seen censorship laws actually become looser over the years and the advent of the internet has brought on the current "information age." But that doesn't make Fahrenheit 451 irrelevant because it's about much more than literary censorship. It's about freedom of speech and individual rights. It's about thinking for ourselves and what might happen if we let the government tell us what we can see, hear, or own.Fahrenheit 451 resonates with me on so many levels. First of all, it's just superbly written. I love Bradbury's intense style which translates especially well on Blackstone Audio's version read by Christopher Hurt (sample). Here he describes the show that Mrs Montag watches all day:A great thunderstorm of sound gushed from the walls. Music bombarded him at such an immense volume that his bones were almost shaken from their tendons; he felt his jaw vibrate, his eyes wobble in his head. He was a victim of concussion. When it was all over he felt like a man who had been thrown from a cliff, whirled in a centrifuge and spat out over a waterfall that fell and fell into emptiness and emptiness and never -- quite -- touched -- bottom -- never -- never -- quite -- no not quite -- touched -- bottom ... and you fell so fast you didn't touch the sides either... never... quite... touched... anything.The thunder faded. The music died."There," said Mildred. And it was indeed remarkable. Something had happened. Even though the people in the walls of the room had barely moved, and nothing had really been settled, you had the impression that someone had turned on a washing-machine or sucked you up in a gigantic vacuum. You drowned in music and pure cacophony. He came out of the room sweating and on the point of collapse. Behind him, Mildred sat in her chair and the voices went on again...Second, I share Bradbury's ardent passion for knowledge and learning. The thought of lost information, burned books, mindless entertainment, meaningless small-talk, conformity, and intellectual malaise makes my stomach twist. I don't believe that we're in danger of the anti-intellectualism that Bradbury posits, but still his ideas get me riled up.Third, I'll admit that I'm a rebel at heart. While I recognize that obeying laws and paying taxes are a necessary part of living in a well-functioning society, I feel mostly distrustful and suspicious when the government increases taxes, takes over more functions in society, tells us what to believe, and tries to revoke constitutional freedoms. In this context, Bradbury's possible future doesn't seem so impossible anymore.I'm pleased that my school district assigns Fahrenheit 451 in its middle-school curriculum, though I find it a bit ironic that some publishers have edited the language to make it more "suitable" for teenagers.

review/text: I've had acid reflux/GERD for more than 10 years. Even with Prilosec, which eliminated daytime reflux, I would still have flare ups when lying horizontally in bed. My doctor recommended raising the head of my bed 6 inches but let's be real - who wants to sleep with their whole body on an incline like that? This type of angled pillow is the perfect solution. I did lots of research - there's quite a few types of wedge-shaped pillows to choose from, all of which are meant to alleviate the symptoms of GERD. I decided that even though the Prop Up Pillow costs more than some competing versions of similar pillows, the larger size and memory foam material would be worth it. I'm a tall guy so having a few extra inches to work with can make a huge difference. I saw immediate results the very first night. No more waking up with that acidic taste in my mouth, sore throat, and hoarse-sounding voice. No more waking up in excruciating pain during the night to chomp down a handful of antacids.It did take some experimentation to figure out how to sleep on it, and took a few nights to get used to sleeping with half my body on an incline. By the fourth night it felt normal. I bought the souped-up version that comes with lumbar and neck support pillows but I've found it's easier using the Prop Up Pillow with my regular pillow on top of it. The lumbar and neck supports didn't provide any noticeable difference, so consider buying just the larger pillow and save yourself the extra $ (you can buy without the extra pillows at http://propuppillow.com/).As for size, its larger shape is very accommodating. I'm 6'2 with broad shoulders and I fit on it just fine. I can also see this easily supporting someone up to 6 inches taller. Other wedge-shaped pillows meant to treat GERD are not as large and I can't imagine a tall person sleeping on something smaller than this.Only two downsides to report, neither of which is significant:#1: Combined with my regular pillow on top of the Prop-Up Pillow, I'm now over a foot higher than my wife when laying in bed. It's a bummer to not be able to cuddle as we fall asleep. But if we really want to cuddle I just put the pillow on the floor till it's time to fall asleep.#2: I've found that I slide down on the pillow so when I wake up in the morning I'm about 6 inches lower from where I started. The pillow is big enough that my shoulders are still raised above my stomach and I haven't experienced any night-time acid reflux so it still works even with the shifting. I suppose some amount of shifting during the night is to be expected, so just be aware of that.Overall, I give the Prop-Up Pillow 5 stars. I give it my highest recommendation to anyone who has GERD/Acid Reflux and especially those who have the worst symptoms when laying in bed.

review/text: I don't see how people can be so hard on this, sure Keanu isnt an amazing actor, but I think he actually did pretty well. I think this is better than most other comic book movies [spiderman 1 & 2, league of extraordinary gentleman, Hellboy, Hulk, etc.] Sure its not as devoted to being like the comics as Sin City[which is frame for frame straight out of the comic] but I think it's better that way. Don't get me wrong, Hellblazer was a great comic, but I think the darker version of John Constantine is more entertaining. I geuss I only have two problems with this:1. although this is a good adaptation, I wish they had kept more of the political and religous satire that made the comics so great.2. They never really explained what that guy in Mexico was doing when he found the spear of destiny, that really bugged me.other than that I really enjoyed this, and I think as long as you go in without expecting every line to pulled from one of the comics, you'll probably like it too.

review/text: I think that "A Philadelphia Catholic in King James' Court" was a entertaining and educational book. The book is about a boy named Michael who moves to Kentucky after his father dies. In Kentucky he is astounded to see so many fundamentalists, where in Philadelphia he had seen so many Catholics like himself. While living in Kentucky, Michael learns many things about the Fundamentalist Christians, as well as his own religion, Catholicism. His Uncle continually challenges Michael about his religion and tries to convert him to a Fundamentalist. This book was very interesting and worth the while. This was one of the best apologetics novels I've ever read.

review/text: I'll add my voice to the paper feed issue. After about a month it has become intollerable. Either it doesn't feed the paper or it jambs. Everytime you print you have to get up to fix something. Being a network printer, it would be nice if you could print from your computer and go get the printout but it isn't that easy. It isn't a paper thing either, I use very good paper (although I don't think I should have to be wed to HP brand everything to use this.) Stay away from this one.I had a problem installing the printer. The help from india did not help at all. The person spent 45 minutes to an hour on the phone with me but clearly could do nothing but read from some manual. I ended up not using their software. You can set up a permanent IP address on this printer and use "add printer" in windows to print to it (ironically, choose "local port", then set up an IP port with the address you chose for the printer.)The software is large and unnecessary, however I did have to install it and uninstall it to get the scanner to work.If not for the paper feed issue, this is a great printer/scanner/copier.

review/text: When a powerful wizzard learns, to his surprise, that he has enemies, he accidentally destroys a kingdom and sets off in search of the one woman who can tell him who his enemies are. His voyage becomes a quest tied up in Ozar plans for world conquest, the world's greatest strangler, and God's eternal battle to rid himself of the Joe heresy forever. In a parallel adventure, an artist joins a revolutionary in a journey to love and the perfect anarchist state. Yet, even this perfect state is threatened by the power of the Ozar rap-sheet, and the wizard seems intent on protecting the power of the powerful rather than on their overthrow.Set in the same universe as Flint's THE PHILSOSOPHICAL STRANGLER, FORWARD THE MAGE combines adventure with humor. The wizard Zulkeh is as unlikely a hero as can be imagined with a combination of pedantic pseudo-scholarly language and abusive behavior. In contrast, the likely hero, artist and mercenary Benvenuti, never really gets into the story, providing a bit of romantic diversion. Still, authors Eric Flint and Richard Roach make it work. MAGE occasionally tries too hard, but often delivers a Terry Pratchet-like belly laugh.Flint and Roach slide a bit of the revolution into their novel, and offer some insights into basic liberties that will create a few grimaces from conservative readers, but they do so with good spirit. Clearly FORWARD THE MAGE has some political messages to deliver, but Flint and Roach manage to deliver them in the context of an amusing adventure.

review/text: First off, let me state that I am so glad I am in far into college now. Luckily, I was in 4th grade at the right time I bought this from one of those Scholastic order sheets (remember those?), almost ten years ago before special interest groups got on the &quot;ban everything we deem offensive or intelligent to children&quot; bandwagon.Anyways, I recently found this book in a box of old books and, looking through it, it was just as chilling to the spine now as it was around 8 or so years ago when I was a wee lad. Of course, now I'm 19 and the stories seem sort of not so scary, but that's just my picky-eating with dark literature (being more accustomed to Lovecraft and more sophisticated horror and all that).However, the charcoal drawings are what make this book what it is. Stephen Gammell (does he have an online gallery or a book full of illustrations like this? i'm soon checking!) has done an excellent job at creating immensly subtly-disturbing visuals with his illustration skills that seems to amplify the effect of the otherwise cheesy (but still fun) bonfire horror stories.If the stories don't scare the bejesus out of you, the ghostly apparitions and deformed nightmarish landscapes portrayed within the illustrations will definately make you want to buy several halogen lamps and keep them turned on at night with perhaps a garlic necklace around you when you go to sleep.If I recall, the scariest illustration was a full-page charcoal drawing next to a story called &quot;Oh, Suzannah!&quot;, almost like something weird going on in a parallel supernatural dimension from some mental patient's hallucinatory nightmare.Either way, this book has redeeming qualities for both folk/urban literature enthusiasts as well as dark-fantasy-art enthusiasts. I heavily recommend it!

review/text: The &quot;Book Description&quot; review is correct when it says that&quot;The Complete Guide to Home Masonry is the most comprehensive and useful guide to masonry for today's do-it-yourself homeowner.&quot;About the only thing missing from this one-sentence summary is that the book is nigh-exclusively devoted to OUTDOOR projects. (The short exceptions are damp-proofing basement walls, and repairing fireboxes.)The book features clear step-by-step instructions and color photographs (one good photo for each and every step of every project -- HUNDREDS of photos total) for working with natural stone, stone veneer, brick, glass block, concrete block, poured concrete, patio tile, stucco, and hypertufa.The projects cover all the simple outdoor jobs (such as walkways, walls, and patios), the common elaborations (such as adding lattice panels to a block wall, or laying tile over concrete), and quite a number of complex constructs -- like &quot;Building a Stone Moon Window&quot;.EVERY section of text has one or more illustrating photographs to show what they're writing about. EVERY photograph is in color, with good contrast, color rendition, and composition. EVERY project includes an &quot;Everything You Need&quot; box, listing all the tools and materials required. EVERY tool that's used in the projects has (1) a picture in the &quot;Masonry Tools &amp; Equipment&quot; chapter early in the book; (2) a closeup of the tool in use; and (3) explanatory text discussing proper technique. EVERY material used has pictures of all states through its life -- from the bags clearly depicting brand names like &quot;Quikrete&quot; and &quot;Lehigh&quot;, to the dry materials, the mixing process, the layout stage, and finishing with the final assembled project.If this book had the same comprehensive coverage for INDOOR projects (tiling bathrooms and creating concrete countertops are high on my wish list), it would be worth SIX stars!

Anyone who does not think Truman used the bomb to end WWII quickly and with less lives lost is simply ignoring the obvious and the evidence. This book helps set the record straight. The decision to use the bomb was simple: to get Japan to stop fighting. Truman wanted to save lives and end the war: end of arguement. This book helps set the record straight.

review/text: This is a great overview of the part of Mongolian history that most intrigues westerners, the years of the great Khans. It is a very accessible book that doesn't require any prior knowledge on the part of the reader, and hopefully inspires them to look deeper into the people and the nation of Mongolia.In the west we've all heard of Ghengis Khan, and we have our preconceptions of "barbarian" cultures or the terrible hordes of Mongol warriors; the reality behind the myths and legends is well worth knowing. I first encountered the "Storm from the East" video series on TLC and it has since re-played {but rarely} on THC. The film or video is only on offer to educational institutions at a very high price, so the most a layman can hope for is a quality tape from TV -or- this book.The book follows the video script almost verbatum, with many of the same maps, diagrams and stills from the live footage shot in Mongolia. It's a wonderful substitute, and an easy to digest history lesson.The relationship of the medieval Mongolian nation to China and the western European nations is fascinating, and thanks to "Storm from the East" it is easily understood. The book is written with a gentle sense of humor, but does not belittle nor aggrandize the Mongolian people or the historical Khans.

review/text: This is my fourth ISE Hot Water Dispenser. The first three lasted anywhere from 2 - 4 years each, before the tanks started leaking and the units had to be replaced. In addition to the tank problem the first two units had failures with an internal thermal switch. It's about a $15 part that was fairly easy to replace if you are somewhat handy with tools and are not afraid of working with electrical components. On my third unit, the hot water tank was redesigned to include a different type thermal switch that was re-settable, like a circuit breaker. That successfully eliminated the thermal switch problem. It seems that the design of the tank for this appliance is continuously evolving. My first unit had a copper tank, the next two had plastic tanks, which I hated, and now this one has a larger (2/3 gallon) stainless steel tank. Seems like a move in the right direction. Installation was easy. I've set the external thermostat (a nice addition) to 190 degrees and it heats the water to that temperature without any spatter. I've verified the water temperature with a digital thermometer. On the previous units I would get spatter at 180 degrees. Since I've only had this unit for a month, I can't predict if it's going to be more reliable then the previous collection I had, but so far it has performed flawlessly. I would like to add that even with the problems that I have experienced with the ISE hot water dispensers, for me it is a very useful appliance, and one that I do not hesitate replacing when it gets to a point where repair is simply not an option.

When Ben Green (Burgess Meredith), Corky's agent, mentions that Corky will have to have a medical exam before doing his first television special, Corky flips out and retreats to his childhood home, where he meets up with Peg (Ann-Margaret), a girl he had a crush on in high school. Will Peg be Corky's salvation, or will Fats get jealous?Adapted by William Goldman from his own novel, Magic is a wonderful piece of work that's finally gotten itself a good DVD treatment (including, of course, the infamous television spot). While Attenborough is usually a brilliant director, Magic shows him at the height of his powers. Every shot is perfectly framed, the pace is right on cue at all times, and he pulled incredible performances out of his entire cast. While the film faded into entirely undeserved obscurity, now it's poised to return to its former glory. If you've never had the pleasure of seeing this brilliant film, do so. ****

review/text: Streisand's lastest CD, *Guilty Pleasures* was a feast of songs she had never sung before, and a reunion with Barry Gibb, who writes for Barbra in a more contemporary way than the Bergmans or Marvin Hamlisch. It is a great CD, and her voice is sublime, aided, of course, by sound technicians. All artists owe their sound engineers their careers though. She and Barry have fun on it--it's fresh and alive. Not so much with the 2006 Concert CD, a recording of the concert tour, replete with IL Divo, a mostly unnecessary addition. They are wooden men with BIG, BORING voices.From the beginning, Babs sounds tired, hoarse and raspy. I saw her in concert, where she sometimes sounded even worse than this recording. The engineers cleaned it up as well as they could, leaving more than a hint of breathiness and weariness. Fortunately, only about half of the songs are weakly rendered; the other half really are terrific experiences. I have no idea what is going on with her voice that from song to song there could be such differences, but if I were Streisand I would leave the belting behind. It wouldn't hurt for her to warm up before she comes onstage, not as she is giving the concert. For any price, a fan would expect the performer to be well prepared. When she sings a soft ballad, she often soars, and her magic is prominent. It's painful to watch her crumble under the memory of her once youthful voice (and it was only a few years ago that she sounded like a 25 year old songstress). Streisand knows how to play a song for all its worth, but she sometimes tramples it to death. *Don't Rain in My Parade* is just not what it used to be. She hits high notes, but without the characteristic force. And she can hold the notes, or seem to, when she takes little breaks before each song's finale. Her phrasing is impeccable when she is giving it all she has to give, but too often she seems bored. This is not a bad CD, just not as inspired as *The Concert.*It also has to be said that it seems apparent Streisand is not taking care of her God-given voice, one she herself has said that she takes for granted (unimaginable!!).The chatter inbetween songs is dull and preachy, and it was exactly the same in every city, except for blabbering about the fattening food she ate all across the US (excluded from the CD, thank the Lord). The fans are really the stars on this CD--they roar constantly, as if they had been starving to see Streisand all their lives. It's an odd treat. The orchestra is incredible, but live, it drowns her out at times (as does IL Divo). This recording does not relfect that though.If you do not own *The Concert* CD, buy it and skip this one. This CD is for avid, adoration-is-blind Streisand fans only and those keeping track of Streisand's vocal history..

review/text: 'Revelation could make use of the pre-established harmony which it had itself laid at the basis of its scheme.' p 43Geerhardus Vos raised the curtain when he insisted, 'to unfold Paul's eschatology is to set forth his theology as a whole', p 11, specifically in terms of the two ages, namely, this age and the age to come. The essay which defined Vos' eschatology was printed under the title 'The Eschatological Aspect Of The Pauline Conception Of The Spirit' (printed 1912). The seminal thoughts found there Vos later elaborated on to successfully publish his plenary tour de force in 1930, which marked a stage of development in the theology of Pauline literature not yet known, and hitherto not yet equalled.In Scripture the rapture and renewal of the earth is subordinate to the resurrection - not preceding the resurrection, but said to follow on the resurrection. In fact, our Lord and Christ explicitly stated: 'I am the Resurrection and the Life.' The dispensational hermeneutic specifically misinterprets the singularity of the revelation to be revealed in us, as Paul deals with in Romans 8:18-19. At issue is not just the rapture, as is misleadingly proposed by Tim LaHaye, but a much fuller climactic event. The whole of creation is on tip-toe to see the sons of God revealed, as the inanimate creation anticipates its own renewal, following instantly upon the resurrection of all the dead. With remarkable foresight Vos deconstructed the exegetical excesses of the popularLeft Behindalliance. No other Pauline work has so successfully delimited the patently diverted modern interests of resurrection theology.In OT times 'eschatology' was connected to the Hebrew word, aharit; rabbis would usually introduce the teaching of the messianic age with this specific word, which literally translated means 'hindmost' or 'after that'. Says Vos of the NT usage: 'Acts has but one instance of the use of the phrase, 2:17, and this is a quotation by Peter from Joel 3:1, where the Hebrew does not contain it, but simply says 'after that'. But this easy substitution [Gk: 'and it shall come to pass in the last days'] proves that the formula was thoroughly familiar in early Christian circles. Apart from Paul, the other NT references are: Hebrews 1:2; James 5:3; 1 Peter 1:20; 2 Peter 3:3; 1 John 2:18; Jude 18.' p 7NT believers markedly differ from OT Jews in that they distinctly view themselves already to be living in the 'last days', or the epochal 'after that', or in the 'times of the Gentiles'. The Greek word predominantly used for 'last' is the word eschatos, and for the 'times' [Gk: chronos] and 'epochs' [Gk: kairos] (ESV), Christ reserves exclusively to the knowledge of the Father (Acts 1:7). When related to the plan and purposes of God in history, both the Hebrew and Greek terminology strongly imply that the consummation of such a plan is wholly under divine control and inevitably certain, eventuating in the great and Johannine 'last day' of the Lord. How Vos leads us up to the eternal state is, inevitably, an accomplishment identifiable of true genius. You can try and put a gloss on the rapture, but in the end the reality is unavoidable.'The very name 'coming aeon' [Gk: parousia aionos] is not merely expressive of futurity, but also carries within itself the element of direct successiveness.' p 25'The main structure of Jewish Apocalyptic is embodied in our Lord's teaching as well as in Paul's. And further, 1 Thessalonians 4:15 shows that in an important point of his eschatological program Paul was directly dependent on a word from the Lord.' p 281 Thessalonians 4:15'For we say this to you by the word of the Lord, that we who are alive and remain until the coming of the Lord shall NOT precede those who are asleep.'Vos' aim was to show the clear teaching of Scripture through the denial of chiliasm in refusing to admit this section of Scripture does not teach the rapture or a millennium: 'The use of the verb 'precede' is taken as proof that the question was a mere question of precedence. Paul denies the precedence in the particular form in which the Thessalonians imagined it. There will be no later or earlier as regards believers, no discrimination between the living and the dead as to sharing in the provisional Messianic kingdom. All will be brought by God to be with Jesus at His coming.' p 247 Vos then permitted 'the infallible rule of the interpretation of Scripture is Scripture itself' and introduced into the equation the analogous 1 Cor 15:52 to add more weight to the scriptural import of the all-inclusiveness of the resurrection: 'We shall all be changed...at the last trump, for the trumpet shall sound, and the dead shall be raised incorruptible.''It is true that the descent is suspended, only it is not interrupted.' p 136Also most discernible is Vos' interest in the rendering of the eschatological events in too literal a fashion, betraying a misplaced zeal. Says Vos:'It were wrong undoubtedly to reduce all the things mentioned to the rubric of figurative language... On the other hand we should not overlook the equally obvious fact, even with the fullest intent of accuracy, the apostle had to avail himself of a fixed medium of language, which left no room for a margin of over-literalism, and whose interpretation by others, while seemingly in full accord with the words recorded, nevertheless may introduce an ingredient of inadequacy when compared with the actual intent of Paul...missing in reality...his true conception.' p 142This is the correct interpretive method to be applied to the resurrection passages. Sequence must be established according to their co-ordinate, or subordinate place in redemption - and not by manner of an over-literal hermeneutic, giving precedence to certain catchy words, when clearly sensationalism is not called for or indicated by proper exegesis. This is the full Pauline conception of the resurrection, at complete odds with the rapture agenda, which is hereby seen to be negligible in applying faithfully the whole counsel of God found in Scripture, leading those who essentially subscribe to a 'gap theory' directly to faulty teachings like, i.e. 'two comings', 'two elects', and 'two resurrections'. The resurrection-theme Vos held as central to recreation: 'As a fact, and that a fact not lacking doctrinal explanation, it is, next to the cross, the outstanding event of redemptive history.' p 147

review/text: Despite the fact that my initial interest in this DVD was the opportunity to see Patsy Kensit, I actually found Jurgen Prochnow and Elizabeth Hurley to be far more entertaining as (respectfully) the skipper of a private yacht and a passenger desperately trying to reach the Bahama's.Although her role is pivotal to the plot, Kensit plays her part as a whiney, insecure sidekick to Hurley's. Her character really only seems to serve as a catalyst to engender a bond between Prochnow's skipper and Hurley's flamboyant passenger in addition to adding some sense of reason to a twist at the end that has me still scratching my head.This movie was marketed as another trip into "Deep Calm" waters but in actual fact the expected confrontation that the movie seems to be inevitably steering towards never occurs, this probably greatly contributed to the lackluster performance of the movie but for me the picture took more interesting turns into examining some really warped human behavior and building distrust between the three people stuck on a small boat together for four weeks.Prochnow plays a washed out sailor who, after a tragic event at sea, has not had the courage to leave port for months. Following an intoxicated meeting with two female entertainers (Kensit and Hurley) he subsequently finds out that he has agreed to take the two carefree women on a four week sail to the Bahama's.What follows is a roller coaster of human emotion, suspense, sex (nudity from Hurley) and confusion. The movie however never seems to find its niche though and its twist is underwhelming and unsatisfying. So much more should have been delivered, especially with such an attractive cast, but the screen time and talent seems wasted.Perhaps this is the reason this movie has been marketed under so many titles. Its original German title was `Der Skipper', but its also been named `The Storm.'

review/text: This book is generally well-researched, with an extensive and balanced bibliography. It is valuable as an information source for research.While the author makes some excellent points about the ineffectiveness of environmental legislation, his argument against environmental extremism is flawed for this very reason. Extremists and activists are motivated by the very ineffectiveness of the legislation that the author himself points out, and many people who are concerned about our quality of life are often driven to take extreme measures to simply be heard above the din of corporate-controlled politicians and the advertising of over-consumption. The author does not seem to realize that if the natural world was not being destroyed at such an alarming rate, extreme measures would not be needed. Some would say that advocating temperance in a time of extreme crisis would be irresponsible.The British called the American Revolutionaries terrorists, while we remember them as freedom fighters. It's all a matter of perspective.

review/text: Wade Armstrong spends thirteen years proving himself to the small town of Big Falls, Oklahoma. He won't be happy until he's the most successful businessman in town, and owns the biggest house on the highest hill so he can look down on them all. Too bad Wade procrastinated too long before signing the contract for the house of his dreams. When he arranges to meet the real estate again, Edie Brand shows up as well. His efforts to sandbag her purchasing the house backfires, and now she's moving into the house he wanted.Edie left L.A. when her contract as a lingerie model was fulfilled. Speculation abounds, but tabloids failed to trace Edie back to her hometown. She's kept a low profile, but the stalker that drove her out of L.A. finds her, leaving a &quot;gift&quot; of handcuffs in a plain box in her mother's kitchen. She doesn't tell anyone of the numerous &quot;gifts&quot; and letters the stalker sent, or just how threatening they have become. The threats drive her out of her mother's house and into a place of her own so she can protect her family from lurking danger. And now Wade has taken it upon himself to protect her.Book two of The Oklahoma All-Girl Brands miniseries continues the excitement with pizzazz in BRAND-NEW HEARTACHE. Maggie Shayne presents a vividly realized, fast paced novel with extraordinary characterizations and a terrific plot. When opposites clash, Edie and Wade find that have quite a lot in common, beginning with hidden interest stemming all the way back to high school. Secondary characters are likewise believable and enchanting, including a mother who's never wrong and an empathic sister who sense energy flows. A fabulous read, BRAND-NEW HEARTACHE comes very highly recommended.

review/text: In "Murder By Injection: The Story of the Medical Conspiracy Against America", Eustace Mullins continues what he started in "Secrets of the Federal Reserve," this time focused on the American Medical Establishment - or rather, the Western Medical Establishment, as the controllers of this system exist in the US and across the pond in England and parts of Western Europe.If you've traveled abroad, especially into Asia, you no doubt know that our system of medical treatment differs substantially. This is because in Asia the culture endorses a homeopathic system, or a reliance on natural remedies that seek to build the body's immune system to fight disease. Here in the West, we have an allopathic system. Although it wasn't always so - and indeed there remain pockets of homeopathic practitioners - modern society's medicine is heavily based on allopathy, in which the focus is on attacking disease at the cell level. An unfortunate byproduct of that aim is that the cell and the immune system itself are harmed during treatment. While a person might recover during their course of allopathic treatment, their natural defenses may have been weakened during the fight, leaving them susceptible to additional disease and viruses.Here, Mullins deftly connects those same Federal Reserve interests to the modern Medical Establishment. On many and varied fronts, Mullins describes how these monopolists seized control American medical care, making it into a multi-billion (and probably trillion) dollar enterprise. Along the way, these manipulators have used expert public relations and advertising to sufficiently convince most everyone that deviating from their allopathic recommendations will result in certain disaster for the individual and society. The author begins with the origins of the monopoly, and then moves into the tale of how Quacks set up their control mechanism; a tale of bribery, graft, hucksterism and murder.I greatly enjoyed the chapters on vaccines, cancer, Aids and fluoridation. Essentially, when there are excess byproducts from these monopolists' latest scheme, such as a World War, they'll find a way to sell it to the public by hook or crook. Such is the case with fluoride, a byproduct of aluminum production and a main ingredient in rat poison, which almost everyone consumes in high quantities via their town or city's water supply.If you've recently stayed at a hospital whether due to an ailment or emergency and then marveled at just how high your bill is, then you'll be interested in Mullins' chapter on The Drug Trust. Needless to say, that little pill that cost you over $20 can be bought retail for pennies. "Administrative Costs" are the reason given by the establishment for the high price, but most likely it's due to creative accounting. This ridiculous system thrives because its overlords are connected to Rockefeller/Rothschild interests. Mullins shows the reader how the medical establishment is interconnected to defense contractors, food production conglomerates, and banking interests; which of course have no interest in actually healing the sick."Murder by Injection" will undoubtedly affect the reader, and should be given wide audience. All of us know someone that has suffered from or is currently battling a debilitating disease, whether cancer or one of the myriad of neurological disorders - perhaps it is the reader themselves. Armed with the information in this book, we can move forward, not being held hostage by a lab coat wearing high priest or the puppet master that moves his hand - and just maybe save our lives.Five stars - heavily and heartily recommended!

review/text: 'Zorba the Greek' is a highly philosophical novel with very little plot. The narrative voice is that of an unnamed, bookish man of 35, and it is mainly engaged in contrasting his contemplative and introspective inner life with the worldview of his older friend Alexis Zorba. Zorba's motto could very well be the Latin dictum 'carpe diem' (seize the day) with a strong hedonistic component, but it goes beyond that because he is also concerned about ultimate causes and the nature of God and the presence of evil in the world. As a result of the contrasting views, the novel has a meditative and somewhat slow rhythym to it, but at the same time it is engaging and enjoyable.Certainly since Kazantzakis wrote 'Zorba the Greek' many attitudes have changed, and some readers might find the novel out of date and even reactionary in some regards. This is especially true of how women are portrayed in the novel. However, there is also the element of cultural gaps that are not easily bridged. Greek culture has always had a strong patriarchal component, and most probably Kazantzakis was trying to provide as accurate a picture as possible of a simple man with a lust for life within the context of that culture. What in the end emerges is a very Greek novel that captures interesting cultural and societal nuances at the beginning of the Twentieth Century.I don't know any Greek, but it seems to me that Carl Wildman's translation of the novel flows effortlessly and doesn't seem contrived. Wildman also provides footnotes in certain occasions, thus clarifying terms that might be obscure to Western readers.

review/text: Unfairly ignored during it's initial release this movie deserves another chance.Unlike most war movies this film concentrates not on battles but the heinous acts of some soldiers as they kidnap a girl rape and abuse her.Michael J. Fox plays the one soldier who tries to stand up and do the right thing.Fox proves he's got what it takes to hold his own in a serious part(even better than Bright Lights Big City)and Sean Penn is riveting as the soldier who takes things too far.I saw this in theaters in 1989 and it left me shaken and surprisingly years later it still hasn't lost it's impact.Director Brian DePalma who usually makes stylish gimmick loaded films does a great job here with the serious subject matter.The haunting score by Ennio Morricone that accompanies the poor girl's ordeal will stay in your mind for a very long time.Tough to watch but extremely worthwhile if you're looking for powerful cinema.

review/text: This is the third book by Dr. Bernstein that I have read and it's seems impossible but each one of his books has more and more to offer. If you have Type 1 or Type 2 Diabetes, you absolutely must read this book.I read the first edition, about 6 years ago. It saved my husband's life. My husband is a type 2 diabetic. After seeing his doctor faithfully every 3 to 6 months for 20 years and taking his medications, he became more and more ill. He was at a point of taking 43 units of insulin a night, could hardly walk more than 75 or 100 feet, weighed 270 pounds, his Hemoglobin A1c was 11, he was always tired out, depressed and hell to live with.After reading Dr. Bernstein's book, I knew that my husband could be helped. I put him on a program of low carb and exercise and the results were nothing short of a miracle. He has been off (completely off!) of insulin for over 3 years, he walks 2 miles at the local gym every day, has energy to burn and has lost 80 pounds! His HA1c is 6.5. Best of all he is back to being himself. He is happy again and so am I. We are going into our 5th year of low carb lifestyle and exercise daily. Something I never would have dreamed of doing before reading Dr. Bernstein's book.Dr. Bernstein is one of the voices in the wilderness. His book clearly explains what you need to do to overcome this disease and he should know - he has been a Type 1 diabetic since the age of 12 years old.Dr. Bernstein was an engineer in his earlier years. He approached diabetes through the eyes of an engineer, working the problem until he came up with a solution. The medical profession would not listen to him (and why would they - when they get a diabetic patient, they and the pharmaceutical companies have a patient for life!). When he was 45 years old, he went back to school and became a physician!The American Diabetes Association recommends a diet of 60% carbohydrates!!!! That is absolutely wrong! Dr. Bernstein can explain it to you. Read this book. Save your life or the life of someone you love.I would give this book 10 stars if that rating was available to me.

Like many horror or occult films that were over hyped yet totally, well, SUCKED! (1. Hostel=why a sequel? Put this moronic film to bed 2. Covenant=it was like watching a boy band in a VERY bad "Spookey" movie) Turistas is definateley the 3rd part to the trilogy of horror movies that totally sucked in 2006.Only one person gets buthered (well, their liver and kidneys are removed=that's it! The only scene you could consider to be gorey=and it's used twice in the film, as the movie opener and is reprised later in the story. The others that are the victims either fall to their death, get shot or are hacked down with a machette=and don't show it!)And their are some long, dull scenes of poeple just swimming and swimming underwater for way long amounts of time that are unhumanly possible.Here's the whole movie in a nutshell: tourist are on a bus in Brazil, it crashes, the american, australian, british and danish tourists get aquianted after the crash, find a beach, drink, get high, dance,one guy sleeps with a girl (only to find out she's a prostitute!), get drugged, robbed and fall victim to poeple who want to cut them open to get their organs. ONE person gets their organs removed, others get shot trying to escape, others get away by these goons all in on this organ thing turn on each other and kill each other. Three of the victims survive and off on a plane home they go. the end. zzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzz.How the heck does hollywood get these poor writers? if they were in college and turned in garbage like this, it would certainly be considered D material.I was disappointed that this film was featured in Fangoria and now question their authority on horror flicks.Want gore? save your $$$$ till XMas and see Black Christmas=This one may save the wave of horror flicks that came out in 2006..Best horror flicks that came out this year?

review/text: I've liked something from almost all of Dolly's periods - hard country, soft country, pop, pop-rock, country-pop - but her early recordings of classics like "Coat of Many Colors", "Jolene", "To Daddy" and "Travelling Man" were among my very favorites. I wasn't such a big fan of "Hungry Again", but the reviewers of "The Grass Is Blue" were right on target. This isn't just rabid fans of a singer saying that anything she sings is great. This is a superb bluegrass/country album, reams better than anything on the radio now, and I'm glad Dolly surrounded herself with the best players and pickers and went for broke. From the opening picking of "Traveling Prayer" you know you are in for all-out, pure bluegrass/country music,and Dolly's singing is the best and the least mannered in years. I love "Traveling Prayer", "Cash on the barrelhead", "Silver Dagger", and "Sleep with one eye open" (my favorite), but the whole album is fine. Only the title cut seems a little below par to me, but with the rest of the album so far above par, who cares? It's a bit of a shame this isn't selling better than it is - this is fine, fine music.

There is very little substance in the book. This is more a fit for a one page or two page article in a magazine than to be published as a hard bound.After you read Krauker's book, you are bowled over by the style, the research and the facts crammed into it. Even though Krauker may have titled it as a personal narrative, there is no disputing the fact that 'Into Thin air' provides all the information that you may want to know about the expedition, and is essentially a 'History' of the tragedy. This book on the other hand offers zilch.The only saving grace are a couple of photos - one showing the hillary step from the bottom, the other showing the areas of the camp and'the huddle' on South col.

review/text: This is it - the purest expression of Varg Vikernes' philosophy. The guitars are beautifully ugly, the drums are at their primitive best, the vocals are still the rawest ever in black metal, and the synths make the whole thing feel ethereal, other-worldly, and dreamlike. It's like wandering through a darkly beautiful mountain landscape - hungered, violent, solitary, godless (to quote Nietzsche). The whole thing is topped off with a long synth instrumental that sounds like the aural personification of ice.The lyrics (in Norwegian), contrary to common view (and regardless of Varg's personal opinions), are not Satanic, Nazi or even racist - they are either personal in nature or describe various Norse myths.There's not much more to say about Hvis Lyset Tar Oss, other than it is an experience not meant for all. Approach at your own risk, and don't be ashamed if you run screaming from the darkness.

I recommend this book for every home library as a source of referral and information. Your Mother has Suffered a Slight Stroke is a necessary and helpful read for everyone and the reader is sure to relate to Kathy and her family and their touching and poignant, true-life experiences.Evelyn Horan - AuthorJeannie, A Texas Frontier Girl, Books One-Four

He loved the movie and so on his birthday we got him this DVD.Big mistake. I have NEVER seen a DVD of such terrible quality. On widescreen HDTV the aspect ratio is all off so that there is big black lines on not just the sides of the screen but also the top and bottom... the movie takes up barely half of the TV screen! If that was the only issue we could have dealt with it, but the quality of the picture itself is just so horrible it's distracting. It's discolored, it's grainy, it looks like it's being projected out terribly old poor quality film projector.My nephew is only 6, so obviously he doesn't care much about video fidelity but it was so bad it even bothered him and he was asking what was wrong with the movie. We transferred the DVD to a Standard definition tube tv and the poor quality was not as noticeable, but still really bad.The quality was so terrible I was sure I had accidentally ordered a bootleg or something... but no, it's the authentic Disney DVD.

I often quote the lyrics of the songs of this album to friends that are going through difficult times, because most of us have been in places that resemble the situations framed in these songs during our life.Also, now looking back at how the artist's life has played out since the recording of this album, you can see how things have changed ... it's an opportunity for someone to see a person in a low place in life, and see that the same person has found joy in life with a new companion and a new baby. Whether or not you believe that she made the right choice, you see the capability to go from despair to happiness again. I hope you also find the joy and hope reflected behind her eyes.

review/text: So which reviews relate to which of the 12 versions Amazon is offering? Based on the utterly lousy picture and sound quality of the version I purchased (2003 DVD by Diamond), I must assume those who rated this mediocre TV movie any higher than a 1 have a different version from the one I bought. Multiple freezes and jumps in the picture (and of course sound) didn't help.Some reviewers who weren't happy with their purchase decided to toss the DVDs or resignedly hold onto them instead of returning them, figuring it wasn't "worth it" to do so. Even if the thing cost only $3.95, Amazon pays the return shipping. Too bad everyone didn't return their crummy copies at Amazon's expense -- maybe Amazon would then get a clue that it isn't nice to offer sub-par DVDs to its consumers AND that maybe they should rewrite their programming so that reviews written PERTAIN TO THAT SPECIFIC VERSION ONLY.Regardless of the release, I don't know why this film was even written and produced. It added nothing to our knowledge of Patton's life except to give him a mistress and show how he died. Too much of the script was a rehash of some of Patton's more pithy dialogue from the original film (but delivered with less panache and conviction), and the rest was embarrassingly cliched. The cast's stilted acting seem to indicate they knew they were conscious of the poor writing. Richard Dysart's Eisenhower was unintentionally funny in his forced delivery, like a banty rooster trying to discipline and humiliate a much larger, smarter, wiser fox.Bottom line: Total waste of time. Makes me want to go watch the original again just to get this travesty out of my head.

review/text: Having just re-read 1984 it struck me that, whilst the quality of the writing is "timeless," (Orwell constructs a better sentence than most "literary artists"), the book's themes get more and more frightening as Western culture decays toward the millennium. My first school reading was in the days when 1984 was literally "the future," (even though Orwell had always intended it as a satire on contemporary Britain, with "1948" the originally intended title); in England today the resonances are especially profound, and what looked "old-fashioned" to `sixties and `seventies sci-fi readers has gained a new and bleaker realism. We're beginning to catch up with the US when it comes to presidential-style "leadership" and "spin," whilst the rewriting of history - with its horrible parallels with the politically correct mythologies espoused in transatlantic universities and the like - is already being implemented, with particular regard to the guilty denial of the achievements of the British Empire, (whilst the Roman and Greek civilisations still manage to escape trendy censure).The worst shock comes with the realisation that everything 1984 says about the manipulation and reduction of thought by language-control, (Doublethink and Newspeak, respectively), is demonstrably happening right now. Things you can't say become thoughts you can't think, and an attempted conversation with most contemporary English youths on the street will reveal how hard it has become for our ill-educated masses actually to formulate rationale thought: what you get is a monotonic patois recitation of received simplistic opinion - or a boot stamping on your face, followed by a law-suit for your assault on them! One recent encounter left me with the reflection that we are so far from Shakespeare one could weep; then I read 1984 again, where Orwell has Winston wake up one morning with the name on his lips, a fleeting memory of a better past. The book is brilliantly written, shockingly painful and horribly, horribly relevant! (It's also fantastically entertaining and often very funny). Read it, read it again, and read it to your children!

The action is great for any fan of many explosions, unrealistic fights and over the top car chases(exactly how many times can you shoot a car with automatic weapons and it still drives as if it just came straight off the lot?)...however the acting was poor by practically everyone...nothing convincing at all. I was actually ashamed of screen veteran Robert Patrick's performance....silly punchlines and almost a robotic performance. WWE wrestler John Cena's performance looks as if it was painfully rehearsed one too many times...even the exotic Kelly Carlson's (who had probably every man in the theater wanting her to go to her NipTuck ways of nakedness or sexy lingerie.....sorry fellas no such luck)portayal of Kate Triton(John's fiance) leaves her acting abilities a little less desirable. Even the supporting cast of almost relative unknowns...except for Morgan(Anthony Ray Parker, who many may remember played Dozer in the Matrix) however his bad punchlines, uneven temper and constant "black man plight" rants couldnt give CPR to a movie that began drowning from the opening credits. I can't remember the last time I scored something this low but it had to be done for the sake of the action/adventure genre....1 and a half stars.

review/text: I must admit, I wasn't particularly looking forward to this book. While I love certain of Mercedes Lackey's writing - especially her Elemental Masters and Free Bards series and her historical retellings of fairy tales - I've never warmed up to her Valdemar books, and I'd never read anything by (or even about) her two co-authors, Eric Flint and David Freer.I started the book, and was underwhelmed. While the concept seemed interesting - an alternate Renaissance Italy where magic works - the execution seemed clunky, introducing over a dozen major characters within the first chapter or so (a common mistake in historical novels). But within the first few chapters, I found myself caught up by the characters and the events that tied their lives together. By this point, the book had become so gripping that I couldn't stop until I finished it - and at 800-some pages, that takes a while! This is a wonderful book, and has persuaded me to check out some books by Flint and Freer while I'm at it. Certainly if you're at all interested in historical fantasy (especially dealing with alternate histories) you should give this book a chance.

Barone has absorbed a lot and forgotten little, and he likes to remind the reader of things others are more likely to forget. Civil rights, for example. One wing of the Republican party had its roots planted firmly in the abolitionist movement, dating back to before the Civil War. You could call it &quot;the Eisenhower wing,&quot; if you were clear that it did not include Eisenhower. As general, and later as president, it seems fair to say that Eisenhower just didn't get it - not so much hostility to blacks as a kind of blank incomprehension - why weren't they willing to keep the place (one is tempted to make comparisons with General Sherman). Lyndon Johnson, by contrast, is one who emphatically did get it. Vulnerable and insecure as he always saw himself, Johnson was able to show real empathy for the plight of American Blacks. So we have the kind of irony so familiar in politics - the soldier-statesman who didn't get it, imposing a civil rights bill on Congress against the best efforts of the cracker politician who did.Barone obviously relishes the irony there, but he likes the story in particular because of an even more consistent enthusiasm. That is: he is fascinated by the hard work of governing, which he comes close to glamorizing in its very unglamorousness. You can see it perhaps best in his appreciative account of a man who he nominates as a forgotten progenitor of modern social legislation - Robert Wagner, the senator and father, inter alia, of the Wagner Labor Relations Act. Without Wagner, as Barone tells it, the New Deal's legislative agenda would have been a lot more insipid. It perhaps explains also his affection for Hubert Humphrey - a name perhaps mostly forgotten today, or remembered if at all only in the sour aftertaste of the 1968 presidential election, which he lost to Richard Nixon.What perhaps gives zest to Barone's account is that for all his skill as a data-miner, he believes at the end that politics is culture and not economics that divides us or draws us together. It impels him to insist that there is a society more important than its contentions and divisions, more than the sum of its parts - in some sense, a res publica, or (back to Barone's title here) &quot;Our Country.&quot; Only one afterthought: this is another book that cries out for an new edition.

review/text: Forget everything you have ever heard about Joan Crawford (good or bad) and watch "Sudden Fear." Crawford, at 47, delivers one her greatest performances of her 45 year career. To denny that Crawford couldn't be as good as Bette Davis (or better) is bull, or she wouldn't have been able to have more time in the spot light than Davis, especially as she grew older. "Sudden Fear" is filled with an excellent cast all around and the suspense builds up slowly, then the confrontation between Joan Crawford and Jack Palance's characters reaches it's height. The only thing I didn't like was that there were no special features, but the film itself is perfect. There are few Crawford films on DVD, this is a must have for not only fans of hers, but people who just like watching a good movie, especially film noir fans.

review/text: I loved this book- as a neopagan it gave me insight into how much of Wicca, and in turn, neopaganism developed. I realize it does only focus on Wicca itself and that there were several other movements contributing to the rise of Neopaganism, but the book's title states the topic so no reader should be expecting much else! On the flip side, because they helped contribute, Freemasons, Aleister Crowley, and others are covered even though they themselves were not Wiccan. Overall, excellent book, well-written, and a must-read for any and all people even interested in Neopaganism, Wicca, or modern witchcraft!

review/text: Ellen Glasgow is definitely an underrated American female writer; how many have heard of her? She writes elegantly and truthfully. The setting for Vein of Iron is an area of rural Virginia where I spent much of my childhood. I don't think it has changed much! In this novel, there are wonderful passages about the impact of Christian beliefs on the life of the people who settled in the region (which can surely be generalized to many rural settlements throughout the U.S.). Glasgow creates a fascinating character in Ada's father, who struggles with his spirituality. Ada is strong, faithful, optimistic- just as I imagined our female predecessors to be at that time. This is a character-driven, setting-driven novel, and I loved it. My daughter surprised me with it for mother's day. Thanks, daughter!

review/text: Meursault, a frenchman living in Algeria (poor guy) lives a normal life. His mother died (does it mather?), he started dating Marie (don't speak of love) and he helped his &quot;friend&quot; Raymond when some Arabs wanted to attack him. He is a complete stranger to others, you don't know what he feels. All you know: he hates hot and sunny places and doesn't understand what he can't smell, touch or eat. Then he kills and is sent to prison. There he finally understands lifes meaning, the absurdity, what it all ment. Is it too late?I was agreably surprised when I read this book. Usually, what we read in French Litterature is horrible (like Zola, Maupassant, ...) but this was quite nice, perhaps a little boring at times. The story is short and you read it very fast. The characters are quite sympatic, even if Meursault is a little strange.It's really easy to analyse after you've understood how it works. I got the best marks when I analysed it at school. It's funny to read it after you've analysed it, because the story is much more deeper. It's a fine base for a philosophical debate on the absurdity of life and Camus has got some interessing ideas.You should really read it in French like I did, it's a lot better and the traslation is sometimes weird.If you're a teacher and want your class to read something more enjoyable than Zola, choose this book. Some can enjoy it (not me).

review/text: This book takes the story of the Larne, Sheramy and UpJohn families through the civil war and it's aftermath. The author provides a very realistic portrayal of the upper class Larnes and Sheramys and the poor UpJohns, the latter having to struggle for work as the upper class had the slave labor to do most of the work for "free". Also, the turnaround of the cultures in the aftermath of the civil war, the Larnes and Sheramys having to struggle to survive and keep their plantations while Corrie May was able to catch a coattail of a carpet bagger and his money.I have to say that "A Reader" in September 2002 summed this book up better than I could. Well worth the time to find this out of print book, I was able to get a copy from my local library. Please note, that the comment by "A Reader" in 1999 who called it smutty must be thinking about another book. This was as chaste as a book could be, and would be a good choice for a younger reader.

review/text: I had high hopes for this film based on the reviews of others and the press. I love creature films and indications were this would be a good-budget, well acted change from the cheesy norm.It has a fantastic 1/2 hour, that being the last 1/2 hour. Until then it's little more than a National Geographic caving episode with a few cautious over-the-shoulder glances from a character or two thrown in, and creepier music. Although some scenes may have you nibble a fingernail or two, it's more because of some spelunking challenge than any genuine sense of dread building toward the attacks you know are coming.I give it credit for having a female cast that doesn't sit around and cry, stand and scream, or trip every time they try to run. Good performances of strong, no-nonsense women here and all the better for it.But we're back to that last 1/2 hour thing. Once it leaves the realm of the Discovery Channel and finally turns into a horror movie, Descent becomes a real thrill. But even that last 1/2 hour is killed by a total downer of an ending. I mean, not every movie has to have a happy happy joy joy ending, but the last 2 minutes were just a roll-your-eyes groaner.Big letdown.

However, the buyer should realize that this compilation CD has not one, but TWO mislabeled tracks. The track labeled "Stardust" is actually "Yesterdays" from the "Clifford Brown With Strings" album. Also, the track labeled, "If I Love Again" is, in reality, "Gerkin For Perkin" from "Study in Brown". This error is pure sloppiness on the part of Verve records, and is likely to confuse the uninitiated.

review/text: I met Damion at a book signing at the World Horror Convention this year,April 2002. Being a avid reader of vampire novels for over the past fifteen years his book intrigued me. Damion finally sold me on Reflections of a Vampire when I did not have the funds with me to purchase the book and he gave me the book with the trust I would pay him back at the end of the convention. Yes, I did pay him back.With some skepticism of a another new vampire book I started to read Reflections of a Vampire. From the first page to the last page this book grabbed my attention. Damion puts twists and turns to the vampire legend that makes Reflections a page turner. In the first chapter some fans of Anne Rice will think that Damion is just rehashing a old story line, but he is not. I do not want to give away what Damion does to put twists into the story line, because it will take away the element of suprise when you read it. By the end of the book you will want a sequal. You will want to learn about Gerard St. Laurue and his father. I cannot wait to see a follow up book to Reflections of a Vampire. I would be willing to put money on that within a few years the vampire Gerard St. Laurue will be up there with such other vampire greats as Lestat from the Vampire Chronicles, Jean-Claude from the Anita Blake series by Laurell K. Hamilton, and so on.

review/text: Someone at Sony must like the idea of pairing Schubert's "Trout" quintet with his Arpeggione sonata, as two years before this recording the label had already published the same coupling played by Emmanuel Ax, Yo-Yo Ma and friends (Schubert: "Trout " QuintetorSchubert: Quintet, Op. 114 "The Trout" / Sonata, D. 821 "Arpeggione", see my comments). But in this newer one by L'Archibudelli (with mainstays fortepianist Jos Van Immerseel, violinist Vera Beths and cellist Anner Bylsma), besides the inclusion of the beautiful "Notturno" in place of the Lied on which Schubert had based his variation movement, the major difference lies of course in the use of period instruments. Well, "period" in a broad sense, not so much because some of the instruments used date from the early 18th century (after all, string players in the time of Schubert might indeed have been playing on instruments a century-old), as because Bylsma uses in the quintet a cello built some 15 years after the composition of the piece; more questionable still is the fact that he does NOT use an actual Arpeggione in the eponymous sonata, but a 5 stringed piccolo cello from 1700 - the same one that is more appositely featured in his 1990 Bach Viola da Gamba recording on Sony, (J.S. Bach: Sonatas for Viola da Gamba; J.C.F. Bach; Sonata in A). The Arpeggione, also called by its inventor, the Viennese guitar-maker J.G. Staufer, a "guitare d'amour" and also known as the "guitarre-Violoncell", is actually a cello-sized, guitar-shaped instrument with 6 strings tuned like a guitar and sharing with that instrument a few more technical characteristics but actually bowed like a cello rather than strummed. Now the whole point of period instruments seems to me to lie in the search for an "authentic" sound, e.g. a sound as close as possible to what it might have been in the time of composition and in the mind of the composer, and as it is, Bylsma's 5-stringed 1700 instrument is no more authentic than a modern cello. The LP recording of Schubert's sonata made in 1974 on an actual Arpeggione (kept in the Berlin Museum of Music Instruments) by Klaus Storck, for Archiv, has unfortunately not been reissued, and the recent CD recording made on the same instrument by Gerhardt Darmstadt for Cavalli isn't so good (Der Arpeggione, see my review), so Bylsma's choice is an opportunity missed.But let us not fuss over these petty details, and welcome what we get, all considerations of "authenticity" aside. In terms of sound color, all those exposed to period instruments will know what to expect here: soft-grained string tone but also somehow less focused and more rough-hewn than modern instruments, which I find quite easy to adjust to; more dramatic differences are with the fortepiano, again soft-grained, with a general lack of resonance and short decay time as well as brittle top, making it sound somewhat like a toy-piano or the old out-of-tune salon piano you might still find in your grandmother's attic. It certainly does not elicit much sense of power and drama. Now how one reacts to that is a matter of personal taste, but I certainly do not think that it invalidates the use of modern instruments.Besides playing on period instruments, Archibudelli's main interpretive slant in the "Trout" seems to be to zip through as fast as possible. Indeed, timings in each movement are the fastest or near-fastest I have met on the 20 or so versions I have heard on CD, including the swift-moving Ax-Ma & friends (Sony, see above) or Ad&egrave;s-Belcea (EMI,Ad&egrave;s: Piano Quintet; Schubert: "Trout Quintet"). Their first movement is brisk, even hurried, rather short on charm, tenderness and the long, lyrical respiration (although the violin and cello interplay has plenty of feeling) but very dynamic, with nervous accents. These 5 pals obviously have an evening appointment back in Vienna and can't afford to idle their time away on their countryside fishing outskirt! In defense of such an approach one may point that the opening movement is written "Allegro vivace" - but it is also in 4/4 time signature and not 2/2. Likewise Archibudelli's "Andante" is forward-moving, urgent, with dynamically dry and pointed fp phrasings at 0:59, but also with not much repose and respiration, and instrumental colors that lack a touch of fullness, resulting in a not so lyrical viola and cello cantilena at 1:19. For the scherzo they take Schubert's "presto" at face value (perhaps forgetting along the way that it is a 3/4 time signature and not a 3/8) and chose a tempo similar by a couple of seconds to the one adopted by Ax-Ma and friends, but unlike them (and commendably in my opinion) do not relax the tempo in the middle trio. I find that it is in the variation movement that their dynamic approach works best, as it fills the music with zest and carefree humor, while avoiding any mawkish fussing over theme and variations. The finale moves forward with decision - our pals seem happy and proud to have their "Trout" and in a hurry to go home and eat it. Still, another version on period instruments, by Hausmusik, originally on EMI Reflexe (paired with Hummels quintet for the same instrumental combination,Schubert: Trout Quintet/ Hummel: Piano Quintet - Hausmusik, see my review) and now in a cheap (at least, it was released as such), 5-CD box on Virgin (Mozart, Beethoven, Schubert, Mendelssohn, Hummel: Chamber Music [Box Set]), seems to me preferable because less radical in its interpretive approach.As a weighty filler, all considerations of instrument put aside, Byslma and Van Immerseel contribute a fine, lyrical and light-footed reading of the Arpeggione sonata, if neither as dynamic and virtuosic as Ma and Ax's nor as profound in tone color and mood as in the classic 1968 recording of Rostropovich and Britten (Schubert, Debussy / Rostropovich, BrittenorRostropovitch plays Schubert, Schumann, Debussy and Britten).

review/text: This movie adaptation of Miles Kundera's book, which I haven't read yet, is a lengthy and illuminating study on freedom versus captivity, strength versus weakness as seen in the interractions between a handsome womanizing surgeon, Tomas, his lover and the woman who understands him most, the artist Sabena, and a Tereza, bright young waitress Tomas meets after performing an operation at a spa-town. Tereza shows up in Prague and unlike his character, they get married, complete with a piglet wearing a necktie whose squeals cause them to giggle uncontrollably at the ceremonyThe movie is set during the Prague Spring, that brief shining moment when a liberal communism under Alexander Dubcek's socialism with a human face, seems possible. To which Tomas mentions the ill-fated uprising in Hungary (1956). Tomas himself contrasts King Oedipus to the Soviet leaders. Oedipus couldn't bear the sight of what he had done to bring about the plagues in Thebes, so he plucked his own eyes out and left. The Soviet leaders though, were unlike Oedipus. Their defense at Stalin's crimes after his death was "We didn't know." Morality also changed since Oedipus. Tomas then says that the Soviet hardliners stayed in power when they should have plucked their eyes out. He writes an article to that effect, something that will cost him dearly later.At one point, the table and glasses rumble as Tomas and Tereza are arguing. An earthquake? Tomas follows Tereza outside. The source of the tremor is then seen. Pushing its way aggressively down the alley towards them is the menacing shadow of a Soviet tank. Yes, it's 20 August 1968.A great highlight is when the picture turns to b&w; portion during the demonstration in Wencesclas Square, soldiers atop tanks, people climbing on top of them, chants of "Dubcek" and "svoboda", the fire of machine guns and people fleeing, bodies covered with Czech flags, with Tomas and Tereza in the thick of the action, marching, fleeing, or in Tereza's case, snapping pictures like mad. The scene ends dramatically with a Soviet soldier warning her, pointing his pistol at her through the lens.Sabena, and later Tomas and Tereza flee for Geneva, but things don't work out. All three journey again, the latter two back to Czechoslovakia, where under the reinforced hardliners under the thumb of Leonid Brezhnev and Gustav Husak, their part in the uprising becomes a liability.Sabena is compatible with Tomas's sex opposed to love. She asks him, "Are you only searching for pleasure or is every a woman a new hat whose secrets you want to discover?" She is sexually independent, strong-minded, and the mistress of her destiny. This is demonstrated when she meets Franz, a married lawyer, in Geneva. At a cafe, she comments on how music becomes noise, that even the plastic flowers are in a filled vase, and points to the building behind her as the "uglification of the world. The only place we can find beauty is where its persecutors have overlooked it. It's a planetary process, and I can't stand it." She becomes Franz's lover, but when he leaves his wife to be with her, she fears for her freedom, realizes she has left one cage behind only to become prey to a different one. But ultimately, freedom leads to another cage, that of loneliness, and the lack of happiness.Tereza wants a monogamous relationship with Tomas, but finds esteem in doing something fulfilling, being a faithful wife who does her part. She can't adapt to Geneva so returns. In doing so, though, it's back to political captivity, back to a totalitarian regime, but at a lower status. If freedom/loneliness doesn't yield happiness, does that mean captivity and community yields it?Yes, there is quite a bit of sex and nudity here, but nothing gratuitous or pornographic. It's more a tasteful erotica, i.e. the much ballyhooed scenes of Sabena and Tereza photographing each other. Sabena comes off as haunted, serene, grave, at times a twinkle of mischief in the photos.Lena Olin gives the strongest performance here, exuding a strong, enigmatic, sensuous aura as the sexually independent Sabena. She would've been a strong candidate as an Oscar nominee. Praiase also to Juliette Binoche's sweet, shy, sensitive, loving Tereza, the role that boosted her to the spotlight. Daniel Day-Lewis's Tomas becomes more developed and human in the film's second half. One of those memorable movies that makes one think in depth.

I couldn't possibly think of another movie with such sheer cinematic buzz, it's cut like an MTV video: blink and you may miss a visual gag.The theme is doozy but interesting -- a slicing of the same reality in time into three perspectives. Blending an innovative mix of animation, still photography, slow motion, and normal cinematography, it illustrates how the smallest change in what a person does can alter the rest of their life, not to mention the lives of others, including complete strangers they pass on the street.Ironic, creative, and simply riveting -- a fabulous kinetic pleasure of a rental.

review/text: WELCOME TO THE WORLD OF DECENTRISTS!!To summarise in simple terms - brilliant , absolutely brilliant! Just plain brilliant! I saw it in the two hours that for me almost passed as two minutes! The film opened my senses to the reality of an ongoing presence of decentralists operating at the highest levels of New Orleans police - which is just what the people of New Orleans need!! Allow me to explain. 10 years ago , it became pretty much obvious to every awakening American that decentralization is a major important answer to the question of what is to be done about corruption in American politics and in the American police forces. In this film , the concept of total decentralization from bottom up is visualized. Several policemen decide to get the New Orleans police clean from corruption in a matter of a bet that will cost one of them thousands of U.S. dollars - merely a few weeks! They decide to rely upon the one policeman they can rely upon (the character played by Nicholas Cage) who understands that to get your area rid of corruption you must be corrupt for a while yourself. As the thin line between what corruption means on a philosophical level and what corruption really isn't is drawn - it becomes clear to the police officer , that decentralization is just as much a philosophical concept as corruption - in ways he would never have suspected. Faced with the possibility of loosing his job if he will not find and aid in the pleading of guilty the parties responsible for the deaths of three children and their mother , he decides to join for a while forces with some of the most corrupt among New Orlean's drug lords , and convinces them that he has no spiritual discernment whatsoever , while his spiritual discernment turns out in the end to be vastly superior to that which he had thought he really possessed. Nicholas Cage performs brilliantly as the uomo sinistrium of modern times - the sinister man who has replaced uomo universalis - the renaissance man.The renaissance man was more or less a liberal centrist , while the uomo sinistrium is first and foremost a decentrist individualist. The result becomes a totally surprising - albeit very happy ending , where it turns out how hard it really is for the main character to get himself rid of drug addiction. All sorts of moral questions as well as amoral ones are asked in the film and it leaves no area untouched for me that was needed to satisfy my senses as a serious viewer of Nicholas Cage movies (my favourite as a kid was Birdy).New Orleans is thus a terrific portrayal of what may happen , contrary to what most conspiracy writers believe today about the New Orleans police , if they decide one day to decentralize their positions from bottoms up. Already , decentralization of police is becoming a major factor of discussion in many areas of today's politics , now that the European Union is beginning to collapse , followed by the IMF. IMF's collapse is absolutely certain - and it may well have very beneficial consequences for today's present decentralists. I am big on decentralization myself and wholeheartedly support full decentralization of New Orlean's police. What makes this film so unique is how seriously it managed to express the meaning of the concept of 'decentralization'without ever needing to even mention the term.

review/text: For the most part, I agree with the previous reviewer, but I'd like to underscore just how wonderful the orchestral parts are: the brief "overtures" (they are not listed as such) reveal two distinct approaches, that of orchestral playing and that of music to support the singing. The first part, sounding rather late-romantic, is superlative; the second part, more contemporary, has its ups an downs. The same can be said for the interpretation: the orchestra and the conducting are a joy; the singing varies. Baritone Richard Haan is particularly annoying and heavy-accented, and manages to deny us quite a bit of the pleasure that the two "ditties" he is assigned could provide, but others range from decent to excellent.It is strange, to say the least, that this opera hasn't entered the standard rep of any American opera house (I don't know if it has done so in Europe); it would fit perfectly in the canon that comprises Hansel and Gretel and Ravel's "L'Enfant et les Sortileges". Sung by the finest singers at the Met in New York, it could be a major success; I'll keep hoping for that great recording. In the meantime, especially considering the low price, I can't recommend this enough.

review/text: Well, there's one that's almost 10 minutes, and there's a &quot;hidden&quot; one that's really listed as six tracks--&quot;The Healing Colors Of Sound (part 1)&quot; thru &quot;My Shoes (revisited):&quot;. That medley is just as unified as &quot;The Water&quot; on an earlier album, and it runs over 20 minutes like that one. I guess they just didn't give it an overall title. But you do get the same progressive sound that falls somewhere between the traditional prog style as done by Marillion and the new harder-edged style of Dream Theater. These guys are a bit too good for the minor label they're on, but maybe that's not such a bad thing--major label acts often end up mainstreaming their sound. The only trouble is that not every store carries them, so not enough people know who they are. Well, there's one way to handle that. Do like I do--get this album, get their others, and drop their name all over the place. Word of mouth is how the original generation of prog got rolling, after all.

review/text: Like Clarkson's "Thankful," Clay Aiken's "Measure of A Man" meets up to the 'measure' of being recognized as a talented young aritst. As far as meeting up to any other expectations, don't hold your hopes up.He's had the advantage of having millions of teenybopper pop fans watch American Idol, as well as getting tons of publicity over the "Ruben vs. Clay" ordeal that was the talk of the summer. He's had professional music writers write every track on the album, mainly tracks composed of overly cliche themes, nothing of pure originality. He has the talent, but lacks the edge, the edge that will utlimately make of break his career as a musician.Clay is an undistinctive talent - the songs on the album do not step out of the boundries, there is nothing boldly original on his first collection of his released tracks . . . Just an All-American, broadway-talent-type artist, with nothing to more to give. If you enjoy listening to cliche music themed on emotions so many other musicians have analyzed and expressed (and a million times better), by all means, purchase this album.

review/text: The late 60s were full of destruction, rebellion and the end of the optimism and the idealism that America was almost attached to. Then the Manson family kills 8 people, which symbolizes the darker side to the hippie/LSD/youth culture lifestyle.Vincent Bugliosi was Manson's attorney during his infamous trial. Here he documents every shred of evidence and every detail which went into the ghastly homicide, and the trial itself, which resulted in Manson and 3 members of his family (Sadie, Lulu, and Patricia) being convicted of murder and sentenced to death, which was later turned into life in prison, due to California's abolishment of the death penalty in early 1970.This also gives an unbiast view of Charlie's life (by the time he was 32, he spent 17 years in jail), his aspirations to become a rockstar, the members of his "Family," why he and his family committed the murders, and, probably the most interesting yet odd part of the book, Manson's rather religious, dogmatic and supposedly prophetic interpretation of the Beatles' double-LP "The White Album." It is complete with rather bizarre lyrical references from the people he was after (the "Piggies") the revolt that blacks were going to plan against whites (The lyrics to "Blackbird" describe "Helter Skelter," which meant that blacks were going to destroy whites, led by "Rocky Racoon, who, strangely would be a 'coon,' not to be racist"), the Beatles as the Four Horsemen of the Apocalypse (The avant-garde sound effects of "Revolution 9", and how the 5th 'horseman' was actually Stuart Sutcliffe, who was in the group but died of a brain hemmorhage in 1962), and how the Beatles were planning to sail across the Atlantic to make Charlie a rockstar (The lyrics to "Honey Pie," 'I'm in love but I'm lazy,' meaning that the Beatles were supposedly interested in Charlie but were too lazy to sail across the Atlantic to California to meet him). It's rather strange and laughable at the same time.It also gives the viewpoint of Manson himself, with interviews, quotes, press releases and biographical information. His comments about Richard Nixon condemning him as a guilty man, while Nixon sends young men to Vietnam to get killed, was particularly interesting.It's a very long, detailed account about the murders that would mark the end of an era, and one of the most notorious crimes in history. A book highly recommended for anyone interested in law, or anyone remotely interested in the Manson cult and/or ideology.

review/text: This is the &#34;classic&#34; old translation by Louis Mercier most of us read and loved. But a good bit of the novel was left out, not so much that the story was greatly altered, but still not as Verne wrote it and intended it to be. Fortunately, there is another free public domain version available which I would encourage you to also download and read; this is a modern translation by F. P. Walter and it is unabridged. It may be found in the Kindle store by typing: Vingt Mille Lieues Sous Les Mers English (or simply: Verne Vingt Mille English). The title is French but don't worry, the book is entirely in English with an informative introduction by Walter. This great new translation is wordier than the old one, but it comes as close, in English, to what Verne actually wrote in French--and it is complete. I would strongly urge you to compare them--especially if you are a true Jules Verne fan.

review/text: I became a fan of Christine's writing through her &quot;Dark&quot; series and although this ventured into different territory I was not disappointed. Christine's style and gift for writing wonderful heroes and heroines along with a fascinating story is not lost. Nicoletta is a strong, compassionate, courageous heroine that learns to make the best of a frightening and seemingly hopeless situation. She is forced into marriage with the mysterious Giovanni Scarletti, who's reputation of darkness and danger strikes fear in the hearts of most in her village. To make matters worse once married she will be forced to live in the cursed Scarletti palazzo secretly nicknamed the &quot;Palazzo Della Morte&quot; where few women who enter manage to escape with their lives. Despite her hesitation she soon discovers there is a powerful attraction between she and Giovanni and seeks to unravel the mystery surrounding her own mother's death in the castle years ago. Is Giovanni the monster her fellow villagers whispered he was or could there be much more to him than she first imagined? Giovanni is just the type of hero I enjoy, like the heroine he is one that can both frighten me yet manage to touch my heart at the same time. The story kept me on the edge of my seat. For fans of the paranormal there is that aspect as well. Nicoletta is gifted with a healing power and Giovanni has the power to speak directly into your mind. Kudos to Christine, for the many hours of enjoyment her novels provide!

The book's writing is atrocious; there are gaps in what is covered; and there are many errors and misstatements. I wasted six weeks struggling with this book. When I finally realized my mistake, it was too late to rescue my study program, and I failed the exam. I am very disillusioned with Jorion and GARP.

review/text: If the second Robocop movie has some redeemable features, then the third instalment has hardly any. This film is the metamorphous of the Robocop franchise into a kid's marketed commodity. In this respect, this film seems to be a pilot for the children-friendly television series that soon followed (though this film is not be confused WITH the actual television show pilot).The violence is low key and the inclusion of a child actor as one of the main central characters seems to confirm this. Maybe this was the inevitable conclusion - Robocop has all the hallmarks of a `superhero' and the commercialisation of this towards the children's toy market/comics may gather a new audience (young viewers) but will alienate an older audience at the same time. The superhero theme is cemented with Robocop's new jetpack and the `ninja' style villains (this movie was released when the ninja turtles franchise was in full swing).The film also lacks the budget of the first two movies, which was a surprise as Robocop 3 was very hyped up to its confusing release date (set back time after time with delays) and was released in Britain straight-to-video.This film can be viewed as a pilot, of the pilot of the tv series.

Kit Tyler is a wonderful heroine, and her struggle to adjust to life in America is a wonderful metaphor that most children (and even adults) can relate to, whether it's moving to a new school, job, or community.

After the introduction to jealous husband, you have to slug through 100 pages before you begin to get into typical Travis McGee action. The action is often illogical, and too often Travis - err - Gavin stumbles into old friends at the most unlikely places, bailing him out of trouble. Sorry, this one just didn't click for me.

review/text: Part One. Troy remains the only challenger to the Greek domination of the seas. However, most believe that the city-state is starting to show flab and the time to end their control of the Hellespont that links the Aegean to the Black Sea is soon. When Trojan Prince Paris allegedly abducts the beautiful Helen, Greek ruler Menelaus has his excuse to take the city. Ulysses agrees to help though he believes that Helen went willingly with her lover. Thus the lengthy Trojan War has begun *(short blip in this book). This is a terrific retelling of Ulysses' Odyssey that Homer and mythological fans would appreciate, as readers tour the islands with the great champion, on his quest, as a guide.Part Two. Author David Lundberg follows much of Ulysses'' travelogue to see how much of the spirit of the great king and his peers still live in modern day Greece. Readers will enjoy the insightful tour that could stand on its own as a fine guide to the Greek islands.OLYMPIC WANDERING is an entertaining unique look at the Greek culture that will elate readers with its use of Ulysses to tell about the glorious past and tracking his trek to relate a deep look at modern Greece. Imitation being the greatest form of flatter; this reviewer expects to see similar combos of tale and a travelogue as the pairing at least by a talented writer like Mr. Lundberg makes sense while educating and entertaining.Harriet Klausner

review/text: As an investigative record of bizarre experiences, some first hand, The Mothman Prophesies is as timely and interesting a read now as it was when it was first published almost thirty years ago. I disagree with some of Keel's conclusions, at least with respect to them being the final word in what is obviously an ongoing puzzle, but he points to some very interesting possibilities. His notions are well worth adding to the soup of the still bubbling mystery that such bizarre experiences as Mothman, MIBs, strange aerial lights, odd electrical and poltergeist effects, etc., represent.That much if not all of what is reported is Earth-related does not lessen the difficulty of asserting categorically that &quot;extradimensional&quot; beings are entirely localized. The possibility of worlds without end lie that way, whether connected by wormholes or whatever in this dimension or in other layers outside of this one. I'd bet John a bottle of HERRADURA SELECCION SUPREMA tequila that our multilayered universe is full of life in many forms, mostly unexpected, and that this will become obvious far sooner than later (in the next hundred years at least).-- Randy

review/text: I bought Kingsley's 'Reality' in the hope that it would offer insight to a major pre-Socratic philosopher, and maybe even tie his thought into modern phenomenology and human Being.Unfortunately, the tone, style and method of the book make it very difficult to take seriously. Why?For one, the book is in desperate need of editing. A good half of the text could simply be discarded without any material detriment to the content.This is in large part because the text drips with Kingsley's personal whining about the Western intellectual tradition and his wish that it were simply less rigorous than it is. Every other paragraph seems to be a lament that 'we' are intellectually deficient in one way or another, or are naively not open to one or another assertion. Before long, I discovered that I could quickly identify paragraphs of this repetitious lamentation and simply bypass them without losing the thread of his exposition. For someone who claims that, "...there is no time at all to spare" in recovering Parmenides, he is extremely wasteful of both his and the reader's time.Another issue are his sparse "Notes" and complete lack of footnoting. For someone who purports to advance his ideas on linguistic, cultural and archeological evidence, he certainly invests very little time in referring to his sources or evaluating alternative views. Advocates will argue that he provides frequent references to the Parmenides. However, these references to the text offer little to support his wider claims of context and interpretation. That is a great pity because every now and then he gets around to asserting something very interesting. However, it is often difficult to accept his assertions seriously when they remain unverifiable.In a similar vein, Kingsley often makes vast leaps of argument, taking sparse evidence and pushing his conclusions far beyond any reasonably supportable boundaries. In short, he has written a work of fantasy, based on a small rump of real evidence.This, ultimately, is why there are few notes. This, ultimately, is why much of his text is a lament that 'we' in "the West" - by which he really means 'you' - are not open to wide ranging and unfounded assertions.What Kingsley really wants is for his reader to accept his assertions as a revelation. Unfortunately, his own prejudices, style and method undermine reception by an interested but rigorous reader.I would only recommend 'Reality' to someone who wishes to be entertained by a sort of dreamy mysticism, though Kingsley explicitly denies that this is what he offers.The book will not satisfy anyone interested in a serious consideration of its purported subject matter. There are numerous better books on Parmenides and the pre-Socratics, including: Cordero "By Being, It Is"; Popper "The World of Parmenides"; Coxon's "The Fragments of Parmenides"; Detienne "The Masters of Truth in Archaic Greece". For ancient reception, you might even try Plato's dialogue 'Parmenides'.

review/text: How often have you encountered a book on Shakespeare or his works that attains a level of writing that is often heart-meltingly gorgeous, even at times comparable to the beauty of the Shakespeare quotations it contains? Probably only once, and this is the book.A helpful introduction by David Lehman reminds us that Mark Van Doren was a celebrated professor of literature at Columbia University, and a poet of considerable accomplishment, who served as mentor to a long list of students who later achieved great things. In his courses he generally spoke without notes, and this 1939 book on Shakespeare's works was also written without notes or references, other than a well-thumbed one-volume edition of the works, printed in about 1906.Any modest power of description which I might possess fails utterly for this exquisite book. Instead, let me give a sample of Van Doren's commentary: "It may well be that Shakespeare in 'The Tempest' is telling us for the last time, or consciously for the last time, about the world. But what he is telling us cannot be simple, or we could agree that it is this or that. Perhaps it is this: that the world is not simple. Or, mysteriously enough, that it is what we all take it to be. Any set of symbols, moved close to this play, lights up as if in an electric field. Its meaning, in other words, is precisely as rich as the human mind, and it says that the world is what it is. But what the world is cannot be said in a sentence. Or even in a poem as complete and beautiful as 'The Tempest.'"

review/text: There have been many screen adaptations of Romeo and Juliet over the years. Some of them played by some of Hollywood's top actors and actresses. There was even the Romeo and Juliet last done by Leonardo DiCaprio and Claire Danes, which to my mind is simply Romeo and Juliet on steroids.None of them have come close to matching the magic of Franco Zeffirelli's screen adaptation. For the first time, he made sure to cast the two roles as close to the true ages of Romeo and Juliet as possible. During the time of filming, Olivia Hussey was 15, and Leonard Whiting was 16. He also made sure to keep the Shakespearean language intact. I mean, is it even possible to change Shakespeare's words into something better? It may be a challenge at first to understand the language, especially if you are not used to hearing it. I recommend that you watch it with the subtitles on, or if you want, get a copy of the play and follow it that way. It might makes things a little easier.It's one thing to memorize Shakespearean lines in a play, but something else entirely to actually act them out. Consider this as you watch these two young actors not only succeed in both areas, but surpass all expectations. After watching this film, you might have a hard time thinking of anyone else to fill these roles.Most everyone probably knows the storyline of two star-crossed lovers who who share a forbidden love due to the on-going feuds of their two families who solve their problems with swords and brawls in the streets of Verona. How then is it possible for Romeo and Juliet to conceive of being together, let alone married? How is the love of their respective children able to heal the rift of these two families?Perhaps, argueably, no other writer throughout history understood the power of unconditional love and is able to somehow give the reader at least an idea of what love is through words. Juliet's infamous line captures the essence of Shakespeare's understanding of love when she says, "my bounty is as boundless as the sea. The more I give to thee, the more I have, for both are infinite." Shakespeare knew that true, unconditional love must be let go, or given, because the more you give, the more you actually have, for you cannot give what you do not have.Aside from the abilities of Leonard Whiting and Olivia Hussey, I also have to recognize the talents of John McHenry as the loveable and poetic Mercutio. He is brilliant, and his fight in the streets with Tybalt is both humorous and tragic, especially when he's trying to convince everyone that he's been mortally wounded, but no one takes him seriously until his final fall from the steps of the building.Franco Zeffirelli is renowned for his film sets, and finding the perfect locations to shoot. Verona looks perfect, as if Zeffirelli pulled it straight from the mind of Shakespeare himself.Film critic Roger Ebert was actually in Italy and walking by during the shooting of the balcony scene. This has to be my favorite scene in the entire movie as Romeo and Juliet profess their unswerving love and feelings for each other.Granted that due to time, there are some scenes that are not in the film, but Zeffirelli takes what is crucial to keep the film and story moving. For example, Paris is more or less in the background, and the fight between he and Romeo is not in this adaptation. Nor is the scene where Romeo visits the Apothecary to get the vial of poison for himself.As with just about every successful film, you must have the music to capture the feelings and emotions for the audience, and Nino Rota's score is one of the most famous and recognized in film history, as he uses his music to truly capture both the love and the tragedy of Romeo and Juliet. The film soundtrack on CD is nice because it contains the dialogue of the film to go with the music.This is truly a film classic. Some viewers may think that this version isn't as "cool" as the updated version, what with our actors running around in Renaissance Era tights, but then, tell me which other film version captures so eloquently what might arguably be Shakespeare's most famous tragedy? Romeo and Juliet has been adapted for film more than any other Shakespearean play. Perhaps this, alone, says why we are so drawn by this story, for as the narrator so perfectly expresses at the end, "has there ever been a story of more woe, then this of Juliet and her Romeo."

review/text: This is how Batman is supposed to be. Batman does not arrive in a 4th-of-July-esque hailstorm of flashing lights. He appears, attacks, and vanishes. There should NEVER be a glowing blue bat-mobile. There should NEVER EVER be nippples on the bat suit. That is an atrocity. Possibly a war crime.The earlier films lined up four men too small to be the Dark Knight, and ended up making the films about the villains, not the hero. Batman Begins embraces the darkness spun around the myth of Batman in the decades of comics. Batman isn't cute. Batman punches hard. Bale buries himself in the role, and is the best Caped Crusader to ever play the role.With Bale, Holmes, and an incredible allstar supporting cast (Morgan Freeman, Michael Caine, Liam Neeson, Gary Oldham) who combine for 3 Oscars & another 8 nominations, this is easily the Best Batman film to date, and possibly the best comic book film ever.

He not only read the entire 400 page book, he was mesmerized and wrote the following review for his fellow teenagers:From Douglas:"Helter Skelter" by Vincent Bugliosi is about a madman, a cult, gruesome murders, and a spellbinding criminal trial. I highly recommend this book to those who are interested in true crime or suspence thrillers. This book is about a man named Charles Manson and a string of muders he and people he called his "family" committed. I am recommending this book to all teenagers who have never herd the name, Manson. I am also recommending this book for adults, for it is a hair-raising and gruesome experience that will leave you begging for more.The book is written by Vincent Bugliosi, who was the Los Angeles County District Attorney, who prosecuted Charles Manson and his followers. He documents , in the book, how he became totally consumed by this extraordinary case. He writes about how Manson actually "played mind games" with him during the trial. Although these murders took place almost forty years ago, I believe that it is important for us to know about this case because Manson and his followers are still in prison and still come up for parole. It is also important for us to see how one man managed to control the minds and actions of so many, so that maybe we can prevent it from happening again.This bokk is written in a very readable style; you won't be able to put it down. I highly recommend it to all teenagers, who enjoy crime stories - fiction or non-fiction. It's hard to believe it really happened!

review/text: Prior to actually reading it, my understanding of Bonfire was that it's one of those "must reads" for any self proclaimed American bibliophile because it is a landmark piece of cultural satire. Now that I've read it I can say that in no way does this book live up to ANY of its hype.Although this is not the first time this has happened, it never ceases to irritate me when I walk away from a book with no actual "walk aways", ie, "what a GREAT story!" or "did not see that twist coming", or "I need a moment alone...those sex scenes were ridiculous!" After finish Bonfire, my only thought was, "ok, so what?" The story takes place in NYC circa the 80's. The focal character is a quintessential, self made yuppie, Wall Street bonds trader whose life comes crumbling down after he's involved in an unfortunate late night encounter in the Bronx, apparently the borough from hell during this decade. What ensues is a strange smattering of social clich&eacute;s with little cultural context (I would've loved more references to the political and pop culture landscapes of the time) and zero character development. I suppose you could draw some parallels with greed of Wall Street then to the all out corruption of Wall Street today but when the author seemingly has no opinion about it, there is nothing the reader can do with it.In short, this is 685 pages you could be spending elsewhere.

review/text: I use mostly hotshoe speedlites - they're easy to use, portable and not terribly expensive. The problem comes when you try to do stuff with that light - most accessories for speedlites are either small/compact (and don't do much but ARE expensive) or are big and bulky (softboxes with grids, etc..)That's when I came across this one - looking for something more than just an umbrella as a light modifier, but not much more in terms of price or size, I found the Softlighter - a neat little accessory that opens/closes like an umbrella, fits into the same size bag as an umbrella, but has a diffuser panel!This is basically a reflective umbrella with spokes on the corners - you pop it open and then attach the white diffuser cover on top of the spokes, and then stick your speedlite or larger flash inside. Sounds easy, but it takes some time to get used to - I would have liked for the diffuser panel to be attached to the umbrella (while it's not too hard of a process, it takes a bit of time to get used to, especially if you're setting up/tearing down the system. Also trying to navigate it to get the flash/stand pointing inside the softlighter is a bit tricky (it uses a "sock" in the center, so you have to work the flash into fitting inside there -- this also makes it difficult to change power levels.Another problem here is getting the flash straight-on -- the sock is in the middle of the unit (where the umbrella-pole goes), and most hotshoe flashes (especially with wireless transmitters) stand 6+ inches high, which will set it off balance from the center. I fixed this by using an umbrella adapter (to hold the umbrella) with a micro ballhead on top of it (to angle the flash pointing to the center of the softlighter). Not the easiest or cheapest solution, but it works.I found the light spread to be nice from a 580EXII (and even the smaller flashes like a YN460II). I went for the 46" as I didn't thought the 60" might be a bit too large for these flashes (unless you put 2 inside the softlighter). It's a definitely change (improvement, in my opinion) over a standard umbrella - if gives a much softer light (hence the name!) -- I'm sure it uses a bit more power, but if you need this type of look, it's your best option (and doesn't cost much more than an umbrella).The bag it comes in is also very nice and folds up very compact. Another nice extra is that the umbrella shaft detaches (screws off) allowing you to get in very close without poking your subject with the pole. Note that the 7mm diameter version (used for certain larger flashes) does not detach.Also keep in mind you'll want a lightstand, umbrella adapter and hotshoe transmitter of some sort (wireless, ETTL cable, PC Sync cable, etc..) to use this. The unit only comes with the umbrella, cover and bag.

review/text: It's always a sad thing when great bands break up. It seems like the bad ones never seem to get the point. I'm talking to you Nickelback! At least we lost Creed and now we have American Music Club back. So the universe of music craposity we are living these days has scored two points towards the positive. This is not quite the masterpiece of Mercury or Everclear but still a wonderful record. You could do much worse. The "out of tune" singing is not really an issue. That's part of the charm of Mark Eitzel. Either he's doing it on purpose or just doesn't give a rat's. That's what makes him great. It's punk, dudes! He makes the music he wants to make and sings the way he wants to and plays with some cool dudes. Glad to have Vudi back in the picture. That crazy stuff he did at the end of "Heaven's 10,000 Whores" on Mercury is positively brilliant and that kind of witch-doctor "how'd he do that?!" stuff is back on this record as well. The album does drag a bit in the middle and I can ride in Mark's slow-mo drink-a-thon stylings for hours but it seems a bit much even for die-hards. At least it peps back up towards the end. As far as getting a new fingerpicking style as Captain Vocabulary says in another review, that's just silly. Mark has a great style. Would haved like to have heard more Dan Pearson vocals too. Check out earlier works for some great examples of how well Dan compliments an idiosyncratic singer like Mark. Expand your horizons and buy this record but only after you buy Mercury first. Thank goodness for bands like this. Thank you Merge records for putting this out.

review/text: I absolutely couldn't stand this book!I'm not understanding how it's sexy for a woman to give up her friends and life for a guy who wishes to control her completely. The Don was a jerk. Nicoletta is an awesome heroine in the beginning, but turns into a submissive wifey thing by the end. It's a sad thing when a woman, to paraphrase an actually part of Nicoletta's thoughts, "leaves her old life behind because he'll never like it, and because she just HAS to". Eeeeew.I loved the Dark series, and constantly used to stalk the bookstore waiting for the next one. This one was the beginning of the end of my love for Ms. Feehan's work. I bought it to tide me over from one Dark book to the next, and it made me so angry that I wrote the author and got into a big argument over the book!Please, please, please...read something in the Dark series, or Emma Holly's Upyr series.

This, I must say, is the best version of Romeo and Juliet. In the '68 version The actors are young and even though it was made in '68, you can relate to them in this day. The acting is superb, no one better could have been picked for the parts. It was a real tearjerker. Not to mention the soundtrack...the songs were just amazing to hear.

review/text: A recent visit to Ireland and the Dingle Cliffs and Inch Strand Beach brought back memories of this film. Although some critics gave it two and a half stars many years back, I am giving it five.Firstly, i liked it because of its use of film and cinematography to give a lasting picture and a visual story. Second, I like the way that the best was brought out of some very good actors and one or two who are not normally great actors.Now, I would hope that this beautifully made film should be put on DVD. This picture should eventually return money for its DVD development for the same reason all good pictures endure. It has a good story, flawless character development, and great panoramic visual scenes as the picture unfolds.

review/text: This is a story of Patty Bergen, a trouble making, homely thirteen-year-old growing up on the American World War Two homefront. Patty's parents are verbally abusive, and her father is known to beat her on occasion. When a German POW escapes from the local prison camp, she allows him sanctuary in hidden rooms in her home. This German soldier proves to be her first love and one of the only people who truly loves her back.I, personally, would not recommend this book for pleasure reading. The novel had well-developed characters, and that was mostly what the author concentrated on. It seemed Bette Greene wanted to just develop a character, and not a story. When something tragic happens to Patty, I'm so busy learning everything about her that I did not shed a tear. Summer of My German Soldier seems to be an analysis of the adolescent human mind, not a novel I could fall in love with.

The distribution of "1984" was forbidden in Soviet Russia until 1988, until then people had been distributing the book underground, copying it by hand, translating it in secret and getting turned over to the authorities by their friends and neighbors. Because that's what communism does, it brings out the worse in people.I was born and grew up in Communist Russia, and even though I was born too late to see the ugliest side of it I still know my history and am able to draw parallels.I had the strongest feeling of D&eacute;j&agrave; vu during the 2008 presidential election in the USA, the way people swallowed the "Distribute the wealth" slogan, expecting the government to solve their problems and make everybody "equal"...it made me ill.Can't people ever learn from history?

review/text: As the wife of Jim Cole, I can tell you that he has dedicated three (3) decades of his life to the study of Grizzly Bears in their natural habitats. His books took three (3) years to write and spotlight bear families from the lower 48 and Alaska which he has followed for years. Jim gave up a lucrative real estate career to pursue his wildlife passion and has made many sacrifices along the way. As a result of the most recent attack on May 23rd, 2007, Jim is now permanently blind in one eye. Ironically, Jim never considered himself to be a professional photographer. He counts himself as a Grizzly Bear Educator and performs original songs about bears to a wide range of audiences. Jim's books represent his life's work and offer useful insight into the cunning versatility of the great bear. As of the writing of this review, Jim has never been banned from any national park nor have his actions resulted in the death of any bruin. Simply stated, Jim believes these creatures to be the most intelligent and impressive animals on Planet Earth! Yes, his time spent in the backcountry is quite non-traditional; but Jim always was a rugged individualist.

review/text: Recently, Catherine Orenstein authored a book about Little Red Riding Hood through the ages, titled 'Little Red Riding Hood Uncloaked', studying the tale's influence in popular culture and vice versa. The book made great armchair reading for anyone slightly interested in the subject.Now Alessandro Levorato has published a more scholarly study of the famous fairy tale in 12 versions published over the past 300 years. She takes the seldom used linguistics approach to studying the tale, breaking down each tale into word choices and meanings, as well as other nuances of grammar and language usage. This is not easy reading, but it is meaningful. Levorato's study is divided into six main sections with a final section summarizing the conclusions drawn from the entire study. The texts of the twelve versions show how society has changed, especially concerning gender issues. The book is recommended for anyone interested in any of the primary subjects of fairy tales, linguistics, or gender issues in literature. It should be made available in any reputable university library, too.For anyone wondering which versions of the tale are analyzed, here is a list of the authors and titles:1. Oral version: 'The Story of Grandmother' (l5th-l6th c., French)2. J. Perrault: 'Little Red Riding Hood' (1697, French)3. Brothers Grimm: 'Little Red Cap' (1812, German)4. Sabine Baring Gould: 'Little Red Riding Hood' (1895, British)5. James Thurber: 'The Little Girl and the Wolf' (1939, American)6. Catherine Storr: 'Little Polly Riding Hood' (1955, British)7. Merseyside Fairy Story Collective: 'Red Riding Hood' (1972, British)8. O.F. Gmelin: 'Little Red Cap' (1978, German)9. Angela Carter: 'The Werewolf' (1979, British)10. Angela Carter: 'The Company of Wolves' (1979, British)11. Chiang Mi: 'Goldflower and the Bear' (1979, Chinese)12. Roald Dahl: 'Little Red Riding Hood and the Wolf' (1982, British)

The Scarlatti Curse is humdrum. Before I reached halfway I really didn't care about the characters. The secondary characters were underdeveloped and the main characters were two dimensional. I also did not get a feeling for the period or the place. In short it seemed like a short story plot that was enlarged to take advantage of her success with the Carpathian series. Please Christine don't write any more like this.

review/text: In June of 1966 (Yes, 6/66), Rosemary Woodhouse gave birth to Satan's son, Adrian. This movie details how she came to be begotten by the Devil and the plot of her husband and neighbors in order to give the world over to Satan.Honestly, one cannot ask more from a horror movie. Sans any special effects, it's all up to the story, acting, and directing to pull it all off, and they all work perfectly together to appropriate the correct mood.Roman Polanski said of the book, "At first I thought it was a soap opera, and then I found myself reading it at four in the morning with my eyes burning." So the directing goes. Mia Farrow's acting is of young innocence that seems rather childish in some parts, but profoundly adult in others: she is a young woman with hopes and dreams and worst of all, fears. Rosemary's concern is never for herself, even as she discovers the plot against her; it's for her child.Better, the audience is never really sure she's not insane. As the plot thickens away from cheery city life towards claustrophobic fear of entrapment, even as we sympathize with Rosemary her angst, her outward worry is not sympathetic to a world where everyone acts as if all is normal. For all we know, nothing could be wrong at all.Then we find ourselves at the end, the coup de grace of horror movie design, where she makes a decision that is sure to shock even the most blase of viewers.The cinematography in this film is amazing. At one point she's looking at a clock and it seems to warp in space and grow further away from her, fitting her insecurity expressionistically perfectly. Simple things like doorways are shown as if there's no mystery behind them at all, yet as they are opened they become forboding.For horror fans, there is little better.--PolarisDiB

This book is somewhat different from the others in that it it goes deeply into one characte's thoughts and emotions. One could label the book slow, but I didn't find it that way. I found the story of David Lurie's mother to be by far the most painful to read. As a reader, we are given only bits and pieces of this woman's very broken heart. Perhaps it's a sign of a wonderful writer that every character in this book seemed to warrant a book of his or her own.

I never buy the first thing I see and I spent many hours researching for the best I could find. My search narrowed down to just a few and this book won the toss. I am truly impressed at what I found here. I purchased several books on related topics (javascript and such) and after reading all of them, this book was, by far, the easiest to use. Mr. Powell's writing style allowed me to retain more than I expected I would. I immediately put into use many of these tags to take my website from average to very efficient (and cool if I do say so myself). The reference section allows me to quickly find more about the tag I am trying to use. Don't let the enormous size of this book intimidate you. It reads easy and a great deal of the book is reference relating back to what you learned earlier.If you are using a WYSISYG editor to make your website and want to get past those limitations.

Though it is filled with facts and dates, it is also full of stories that make colonial St. Augustine come alive.

Featuring "Fear of a Blank Planet" (the Quadrophenia of the new millennium)in it's entirety, plus a 2nd set dating songs back to the "Signify" album, this is a wet dream for any Porcupine Tree fan. And as for the rest of the world, they have arrived folks! Refusing to be pidgeon-holed into any one particular category of rock, the band easily segues from Prog Rock to ballads to metal without missing a beat. This release pays tribute to the best quintet of musicians (including long-time live accomplice John Wesley) currently touring. This is the "thinking man's" rock band, one that obligates one to actually invest themselves in the music. Superb. Sublime. Beautifully compelling.

It is a little silly to try to find anything very profound in this one; for a wonderful and more serious treatment of the Arthurian legend, start with The Crystal Cave by Mary Stewart.

I did find them a little difficult to put on, but once they were on they stayed in place nicely and provided great support.The only problem I had was, like the other review stated...they ran the second time I wore them. For as expensive as these pantyhose are, they should last longer than 2 wearings.They are not too sheer, if that is something you are looking for in support hose. They look more like tights when they are on your legs. I did find the beige shade to be a little more like a pale nude shade.

With all the hungry, talented musicians in the world, I would think this film maker could have found one that could provide decent music.Although I liked Potente in other films, it was difficult for me to find the characters interesting. Maybe I could forgive Lola for being in love, but her boyfriend seemed worthless.Yes, this film showed various futures that could have arisen from a single starting point. That is a good idea for a film, but I just think, in spite of the attempts at originality, the result did not bear fruit. For a more intelligent film about the possibilities arising from a situation, I think Rashomon would be a better way to spend your time.

review/text: In the midst of a rising number of superhero/comicbook films, "Batman Begins" stands as a mark against which all others should be measured from here on. Until I saw this film this summer, I said as much about both Spider-Man movies. Sam Rami's take on Peter Parker focuses on his character as much, if not more, than on his powers and daring deeds. Yet both S-1 and S-2 nearly fell into the same trap created by the earlier Superman and Batman films in that we got more about the villians than the main characters."Batman Begins" is a great movie, period. You can enjoy it if you've never seen another Batman film, or another superhero film for that matter, or even if you've never read a single issue of the comic. It may start a bit slow, showing Bruce Wayne's evolution into the Batman, but every second of screen time devoted to it is necessary to the story and allows even those well versed in the character to see and understand this tortured man's evolution into the avenging Dark Knight. And it is the most faithful redition yet of the character as he has been presented by Bob Kane, Dennis O'Neil and Neil Adams, and Frank Miller.Drawing inspiration from all of the above, the screenplay by Chris Nolan and David Goyer is tight and emotion-packed as well as filled with marvelous action pieces. Their Batman is indeed a "creature of the night...black...terrible...." Several moments during the Batman's first appearance will make you jump as if you're watching a tense thriller or horror film. And Christian Bale's performance nails the character from every angle. There a subtlties in his portrayal--body language, expression--that in some scenes project far more than any amount of dialoue could. He carries off Bruce's numerous emotional states, as well as his facade as the "millionaire playboy" in a way that no previous actor ever has. The highest compliment I can give him is to say his presentation of the dual character Bruce Wayne/Batman ranks on par with Christopher Reeve's rendition of Clark Kent/Superman in "Superman, the Movie."As for the supporting cast, I never thought anyone could replace Michael Gough as Alfred from the Burton films, but I shouldn't have worried. Though Michael Caine looks nothing like the comic's portrayal of the faithful Wayne butler, he brings off the part with the perfection I've come to expect in Caine's performances.The big surprise to me was Gary Oldman. I've known for years that the man was an absolute chameleon of an actor, but his casting as the young Jim Gordan also raised some doubts. Until I saw the film. His Gordon is perfect. He looks, acts and sounds like Jim Gordan should. No one has ever played this character better, and it's my sincere hope that the next film(s) explore the relationship between him and Batman.As for the villians and the lead actress, here is where my only quibble with the film appears, and it's certainly not enough to eliminate a star from my rating. Liam Neeson, Cillian Murphy and Katie Holmes are all marvelous in their respective parts; however, "Batman Begins" continues the tradition of the "two-villian+love-interest" motif that now plague the superhero film genre. While not nearly as much time is devoted to their storylines or the relationship between childhood friends Bruce and Rachel Dawes, the fact that they are present gave me an, "Ugh, here we go again" moment. Without giving anything away, the next film needs to devote its plot to Batman versus a single nemisis just as the original Burton film did. And this time leave the girl out of it. Bruce may have plenty of arm-candy as Gotham's most eligible bachelor, but as in the comics, they should be only that. He shouldn't be close to, and certainly shouldn't wind up in bed with, ANY of them. Fortunately in this film the closest we get to any kind of sex between Rachel and Bruce is a somewhat chliched film-ending kiss, something that made me voice a very relieved "whew!"This is by far the best Batman film ever made. It may even be the best superhero film ever made. I'll need to see it a few more time before I decide, but now that it's coming out on DVD, I'll be able to do just that!

It was different from some of the JAK books because there is no paranormal element, but rather the two main characters more or less were dealing with post traumatic stress syndrome, one from being a marine in wartime and the other from finding her parents murdered. The book was JAK at her best, funny and touching. Her banter and repartee are at their finest.One thing that hits me as I'm writing the review is how I wasn't bothered by some of the subject matter that the book dealt with as I am with other romance writers. Perhaps that's due to the fact that it wasn't revealed until the end or just that JAK handles it more sublimely than other authors. She's not all gore and prurience for the sake of gore and prurience. Thanks for that, JAK!

Overall, the movie was just too sappy. And every &quot;twist&quot; is not surprising. Also, I don't understand why the movie switched between color and black-and-white -- I'm guessing the decision was made in a very late editing session because it didn't seem to have any context. In conclusion, I thought the bar scenes were the best...I can't believe I'm agreeing with the guys. I encourage you to check your cable listings if you're curious about this movie and spend your money on something better.

review/text: I didn't know it at the time this was assigned to me, but I was bound to hate this book. Correctly called an existentialist masterpiece, the book runs in circles. You cannot identify with this character because he is so detached from his existence. The only 'moral lesson' to be had seems to say that existence has no objective meaning, only that which you give it (an existentialist tenet) and if you give it no meaning, it doesn't matter any way (point of the book).As an Objectivist, I just can't identify with or support that in any way. The book gets 2 stars because Camus' use of language is wonderful, but it is a talent wasted on a pointless book. If you want to read a book with purpose instead, pick up Ayn Rand's Atlas Shrugged. Although her use of language is not as fluid, the themes of her books make much more sense.

That's why I give his book two stars.However, when Ike starts to discuss Tina, it gets confussing. One needs to take notes in order to keep up. He's constantly contradicting himself and blaming Tina for his actions. That's an abuser. I've found that you have to take whatever Ike Turner says with a grain of salt. Over the years, either on tv, print media, Tina's book, then his own book, Ike's story is always changing. It's gone from he only slapped her, he only hit her once, to he never hit her at all. However, the story from Tina (and others) has always been the same. There are definitely two sides to every story and the movie &quot;What's Love&quot; totally had some facts mixed up, but Ike needs to get one story and stick with it.I was also disappointed with the contribution by Little Richard. I was confused because since I've been alive, this man (rock music's own Richard Simmons) has argued and insisted that he is the &quot;architech of rock 'n roll&quot;. Hey, no argument here. But suddenly, Ike Turner writes a book and Little Richard now says that Ike is the architech. And Ike did record what is considered the first rock record, &quot;Rockket 88&quot;. What really got me though was when Little Richard insulted Tina. Is it me, or is that unprofessional? Ike is always saying that he has nothing against Tina, but he allowed these insults to be printed in his autobiography-in which he claims that he has no career because of her. Will it ever end?I would recommend this book only if you have nothing else to read and you've borrowed it from the public library. However, there are several other books on the history of Rock music/Black music that are much better.

review/text: Like many of the old-time singing cowboys, screen star Gene Autry has long been discounted by some country snobs, who see him as too hokey to be part of the classic country canon. Too bad for those folks, though, because Autry's music is both rich in country tradition and musical show-biz savvy. Like Roy Rogers and other hayseed Hollywood harmonizers, Autry dipped liberally into jazz and swing, giving his music a nice little bounce. The songs are delightfully corny and often well-crafted, drawing on the traditions of the Tin Pan Alley composers -- this is music that was made to entertain, and it still works its magic, all these decades later. This is a nice 2-CD set that gathers material from many of the labels Autry recorded for, including Columbia, Okeh, Vocalion and a slew of smaller outfits, and spans his career from 1931, when he was still singing roughneck blues (ala Jimmie Rodgers) up through the early 1950s, when his success with "Rudolph The Red Nosed Reindeer" had led him to a profitable sideline singing songs for kiddies. This is an excellent collection which really does justice to the wide range of material Autry covered... Highly recommended!

All the action in the movie keeps fans glued to the screens and wondering what could possibly happen next. Not a dull moment in the movie. Can't wait for it to come to the movies cinemas here in Australia in June 07 so we can watch him larger than life and in surround sound, will make a great movies even better.

review/text: I am an intermediate runner I would say. I run various 5K and 10K's, Half marathons and have started to dabble into the world of trail and adventure racing. I say that to let you know I am no professional but I do love to run and compete against myself. For the Kansas City half marathon this past year I wanted to try a minimalist shoe to see if my times would change any from my times I produced in Nike Vomero's and Mizuno Wave's. I tried multiple pairs of this type of shoe on and unfortunately for me (due to the color scheme) these felt the best.I was amazed at how comfortable they felt because by looking at them you would think it would feel like an old High School CC waffle, not the case. The only running I did on these prior to raceday was about 5 miles at an easy pace on a treadmill to get the feel of the shoe. Raceday comes and yes I get alot of looks but I eventually get over that. The first couple of miles were interesting and I thought I had made a mistake. However, once I got into my stride these performed greatly. I was able to maintain splits at personal record times with no thoughts about foot and leg pain. By the end of the race I had knocked off 5 minutes from my previous times, I will let you decide whether it was the shoe or training. My legs felt great as did my feet. I did have one little "hot spot" on one of my toes but that should be expected.I tried these just to see what it would be like to race in a minimalist shoe and I can now say I will never race in a trainer again. I swear by these shoes for racing and speedwork. Get over the color scheme and enjoy this pair of shoes. Oh yeah the "ecco friendly" piece doesn't hurt either.

review/text: I really wanted THE MOTHMAN PROPHECIES because I thought that the story of the Mothman would be fascinating reading, a really intriguing narrative of the sightings of the tall, grayish man with wings and red eyes who could take off in flight straight up off the ground, an interesting examination of the myth and the legend. There is something to me very frightening about this type of legend, and I was eager to read the exploration of sightings around Point Pleasant, Va., in 1966 and 1967 before the Silver Bridge collapsed and nearly 40 area residents died in the tragedy. What a great tale could be told, I thought...I am still waiting. This book is not well structured or told. It seems to be the dumping ground of every otherwordly event Keel has ever seen or heard of. There is little narrative arc here or suspense. Keel has the mistaken notion that loading the book with every bizarre occurence he's ever been told or witnessed gives him credibility, but it is actually the opposite. He and his "colleagues" saw so many UFOs and strange lights in the sky in West Virginia (and other places across the country) in the late 1960s, that one simply cannot believe that there isn't more corroboration of these sightings.Keel does say that he doesn't believe in beings from other planets, but rather beings from a dimension outside of our own who like to make trouble for us, find things out about us, and sometimes warn us of things that are going to happen. Because of their inexperience with earth time, they often use out of date slang and drive old cars that are in mint condition and still smell new. For some unexplained reason, the "people" from this other dimension seem always to wear thick-soled shoes.Keel as a true believer is a poor writer of a convincing book, as he often justifies a witnesses credibility by saying that they are respectable people, or some such qualifier. He anticipates, then, no need the reader might have to be convinced that thousands of sightings of UFOs and Mothman may need some evidentiary backup. This lack of the writer's disbelief and proof, the lack of any plot or arc and the muddled content of the book make this work a solid disappointment. Someone needs to let me know if the book that can be written about this ever is written.

I am really amazed by his unique style of doing physics: he always create anything from scratch, always has his unique point of view, even on an old problem. All I can say about Feynman is Genius!!!This book is about Feynman's extraordinary viewpoint on statistical mechanics. I can bet that this is an unique S.M book.but i don't think it's for beginner, I suggest you should finish a standard statistical mechanics course before you read this one.I can not find suitable words to admire this great book, so I quit here, but in the end, I strongly recommend this book to all physicists, physics-major students!

review/text: As a fan of both Costello and Frisell, I was pleased to see this record come out - it's been a long tradition in jazz to play around with pop songs, and I thought it was an exceptional idea to choose them from this great Costello/Bacharach album.The result is terrible, however. Yeah, everyone is playing the notes very nicely, but these are merely rote and exceedingly pallid, mainly instrumental verions of the originals, which on the first album are full of much more passion and spontaneity. There is no imagination or inspiration here, no sense of even an attempt to make the music their own. It seems inexplicable that no one involved in this project could hear how dull and lifeless it was. And on a personal level, Billy Drewes is a taste I perhaps will never acquire. Don't waste your money, this is an awful record.

review/text: This book was a good book. It kept me want to read on and on. The only reason I gave it **** is because I got kind of confused during the middle of it. Here's my summary on the book:A teenage girl named Beth has to go with her mom and brother to stay with her mom's family. She has to leave behind her boyfriend, Ray, with whom she works at a stained glass store. Her mom ran away from home when she was 17 and hadn't been back since then. When they get to the house, Beth meets her crazy, drunk aunt named Iris. Iris severly dislikes Beth's mom, who's name is Hannah. Beth is not really sure why. In this book, Beth finds out what truly happened the night before Hannah ran away and why she did.This book leaves you hanging on the edge of your seat waiting to see what comes next!! Enjoy!!

The book just goes on and on. The only reason I read it was because my mother asked me to. This book could have been written in 50 pages but no. It goes on for 300 some odd pages. I would have rather read the dictionary. The only reason I give this book 2 stars is because there was maybe four parts that consisted of 2 pages that were mildly interesting. Take my word for it. This book should be skipped.

review/text: After reading Professor. Lundberg's book it is difficult not to agree with his love for everything Greek! The author has spent much of his adult life in Greece and has a Greek wife, so he definitely knows what he is talking about.After a brief introduction where he describes the impact Greece had on him when he first arrived Professor Lundberg tells us how deeply rooted modern Greek culture is in the ancient Greek culture of the Homeric heroes. The first part of the book is about the hero Ulysses and how he travelled *to* Troy, and in the second part of the book the author and his family follows in the footsteps of Ulysses in modern Greece. Even though a lot has changed over the millenia, the landscapes and the culture are still more or less the same. The sea, the cliffs, the friendly and curious people, the food, the wine, and the fierce individualism of the Greek people.In Greece, in contrast to the rest of the Balkans, history is not divisive, or a weapon. for the Greeks it is a uniter, somehing that makes them comfortable with their own identity. Remember that Greece has a history at least as turbulent as the rest of the Balkans with foreign occupation, war, civil war, military dictatorships, and politicians as corrupt as any! There should be a lesson for us all here.The book is not a travel guide as such, but it will help a traveller who wants to get more than just the standard tourist sights.

review/text: Okay. You have two movies here that many critics and customers want to compare. We have the original &quot;The Haunting,&quot; impeccably filmed in 1963 in black and white by the talented director Robert Wise. The stars were Julie Harris, Claire Bloom, Richard Johnson and Russ Tamblyn. One cannot help but admit that this version is superior to the remake on a psychological level. Also you can't do better than Ms. Harris or Ms. Bloom. It was a frightening movie and one I remember from my childhood days.Now, on the other hand, here in the 21st Century, we have Jan DeBont's remake of &quot;The Haunting.&quot; Would people have wanted DeBont to do what they did with the remake of &quot;Psycho?&quot; Filmed it exactly? We know how &quot;Psycho&quot; fared, don't we? Anyway, I found the special effects, scenic design, and sound effects mind-boggling and fun. Sure, we see MORE in this film, but is that wrong? If you don't compare the remake to the original, you may have a better time. I was disappointed in Liam Neeson's lifeless performance, and Lili Taylor is no Julie Harris. Owen Wilson was rather annoying in his role, but Catherine Zeta-Jones was the surprise star. Sure, they updated her and made her look like a tart. But what a tasty tart. And along with her incredible beauty, she brings a lot of life and vitality to the spooky surroundings. And weren't Bruce Dern and Marian Seldes a hoot as the creepy caretakers?So, the plot is much different than original, and the ending lacks the psychological/emotional impact of the 1963 version. But I had a good time throughout the movie, and don't think it's fair to compare such different movies. Apples and oranges. But, if you have an open mind a good bowl of popcorn, I think you'll have fun.

review/text: Why is it so often that an artist's first CD is her best? Perhaps it's because there are no expectations for a first CD. Regardless of the reason, Sheena's first CD is definitely her best. She and her producer, Christopher Neil, chose 10 catchy pop songs for this album. Neil gives Sheena room to breathe life into each of these pop gems. She sounds young, excited, and sympathetic on these tracks. And I agree with the reviewer before me - when I heard the bonus tracks, I wondered why they had been cut from the original album! So often the bonus tracks are long remixes and other rarities that only an artist's mother could love, but these bonus cuts are classic Sheena. This is well worth your money.

It seemed as if Mr. Patterson stopped by a bar one night and jotted it down on a napkin! It should have been labeled as no more than a short story.I believe the last time I read a book with such a large font, two inch margin on all four sides and less than 200 words per page ---- I was in the third grade!! New chapters were used as a way of extending the story/number of pages --- they were not used as a means to express a new idea or thought.Take my advice -- do not waste your time or money.

review/text: Why are you listening to music per se, if you're not listening to THIS! I have no idea why this album doesn't have a full five-star rating. If you're going to put down great music it better be because you're a musician putting out better material. (It may seem like I'm defending this album over a measly half-star but I'm just endorsing it heavily and this is my method.)I made a mistake when I first came across this album during a visit to Seattle because I didn't snatch it up then and there (even though I got to hear the whole album). After a month of futile searches in music stores from Seattle to New Orleans, I decided to make it my first purchase from Amazon when I discovered Amazon had the album in its stock. Yes, this album was musically strong enough for me to endure the hassle and initial misgivings of ordering something over the Internet. While this is not a plug for Amazon, this is a definite plug and testament to the hold and strength of this music after listening to it only once.On that note, this album, the music on it, is evolutionary. This album embodies the future of intelligent DJ mixing. Sure, I think John Digweed's 'Bedrock' is intense and wild after the initial songs on both CD's, but I can still find other DJs who mix in his vein and style, using his approach. I can't say that about Kid Loco's DJ-Kicks album, and neither can you (unless you're listening to something I and the rest of the world hasn't yet heard of). The only other DJ music mix that resembles this effort by Kid Loco is the other DJ-Kicks release by the Thievery Corporation. But they only resemble each other in the intelligence of mixing choices and not in their sound or execution. In my humble and otherwise insignificant opinion, this album by Kid Loco is far more sumptious and haze-inducing than TC's album, but get them both if you can. This is not an endorsement for the DJ-Kicks series, either. These are the only two DJ-Kicks albums I enjoy and listen to with any frequency, even six months after purchase (other DJ-Kicks albums weren't so great).Take my word for it, I listen to a lot of music in general. A lot of good music, too. These albums, especially Kid Loco's, stands out. As for a short description of the music, it's deep, down, and murky, but not at all subterranean since it lifts, is very soulful, is full of epiphany, is completely accessible, and makes you proud to own and share it with others.

review/text: It is an unique idea of digging into the historical crime of accused murderer King Richard and discovering the truth through factual records and the reports of people living at the time and it was well written but personally I couldn't work up a lot of enthusiasm about it.Honestly, most Americans have only a passing familiarity with English royalty and even less with their interwoven families and unless you are familiar with these people and CARE about who did what to whom and why the book becomes tedious very quickly.Now if it had been about whether George Washington really had chopped down the cherry tree or whether it was really a wheeping willow and his cousin who framed him for the arborcide then maybe I could have worked up more interest.I don't mean to belittle the murder of the princes but we don't have any parallel crime in our history that I could have compared it to.So unless you are a British history buff I would give this one a pass.

review/text: Having been a fan of Ra since the release of From One back in 2002, I've been anxiously awaiting their second album. Since then three years have passed, Skoota Warner and Sean Corcoran are gone (although Warner was a part of the band when Duality was recorded) and PJ Farley and Andy Ryan are in, and now Duality is finally here. Like with their debut album From One, Duality was forgettable the first listen through. But after a second and a third things improved considerably. However, this album has failed to improve upon the first.The vocals. They're still superb. Sahaj Ticotin is one of the most talented vocalists I've ever heard. I would recommend this album in a heartbeat if it were based on vocals alone. But that is not the case. The production quality is good and I still enjoy that their sound is exotic yet familiar. Note however, that this album is far less heavy than From One, which wasn't that heavy to begin with. A few of the songs could even be classified as rock/pop. That may strike fear into some of you but I only said few, not all. Lyrics are nothing special here. While they are heartfelt they just didn't connect with me on a personal level. Splitting the album into two themes (fear and love) is a unique idea, but it didn't improve the album in any way. It's kinda like the silver bow on a birthday present. It's nice, but who cares about it once you get to the present itself?As with From One, the tracks are a mixed bag. You have strong songs such as "Fallen Angels", "Take Me Away", "Say You Will", and "Got Me Going". But you also have songs that just plain suck or are forgettable as soon as the next track starts. These include "Superman", "Every Little Thing She Does Is Magic", and "Swimming Upstream" (sorry, but "Walking And Thinking" on From One is so much better.)Next problem. I see signs of unoriginality here. The verses from "The Only One" sound a hell a lot like the verses from "Do You Call My Name" on From One. I've also noticed a couple of recycled lyrics with just a word change or two. Tsk tsk. Lastly, I find it to be odd to have the songs "Undertaken" and "Taken" right next to each other on the track list. But that's just me...(The following thoughts on the album art had no effect on my score. I just have an interest in graphics and photography so I'm always critiquing album covers.) The album art is ok. The cover is just background and text really. And the photos of the members. I know you're supposed to look cool and all but at least look at the camera! It annoys me when the vocalist is looking at me and the bassist is gazing off to the side like there's a riot going on or there's free cheese samples being offered.OVERALL: If you purchased From One and loved it, you'll find plenty to enjoy with Duality. If you're looking for something different or original in the rock genre, then check the album out. It's worth the ten dollars so I'll say pick it up so long as you don't buy it thinking this will be the album to end all albums.

review/text: While I am not usually a fan of books where the hero is overly domineering, I must concede that Christine Feehan writes so well that I enjoy her novels even though the men are so controlling and obsessive it would be frightening in real life.&quot;The Scarletti Curse&quot; is not a part of the Carpathian series, but I found myself enjoying it as much, if not more. The heroine is a healer but in a time where she could be burned at the stake should this secret gift be discovered. In order to protect herself, she pretends to be a healers apprentice. Unfortunately, the one man she wishes to hide this talent from, Giovanni Scarletti, is not fooled.Like much of Feehan's work, the story is very gothic in feel and the villain(s) are truly horrible. While the hero is constantly swooping in and saving the heroine, it becomes more of a joke between the two of them than a tiresome what-a-stupid-girl scenario.I was leary of this novel after being dissappointed with &quot;Lair of the Lion.&quot; This novel is much, much better. If you like her Carpathian series, or are interested in paranormal romance, this is a good book to read.

review/text: I'm not a fan of science fiction, and so when my book group chose this book as its monthly selection to read, I was dubious. But then I started reading this small, seemingly simple little book and I was hooked - completely. Yes, it's science fiction. Yes, it requires the reader to accept the reality of a world that is a figment of the author's imagination. Yes, it deals with censorship and book burning and the dangers of mindless feel-good entertainment. And yes, it has a great plot and tells the fast paced story in a mere 165 pages. But in this case, the total effect is much much more than the sum of its parts.There's the quality of the writing first of all. The words run across the page with searing intensity, pulling the reader into a world that feels real and creepy. It pulsates with its theme, which is of fire and firemen and the cruel act of destroying books. It's intelligent and literate and uses some direct quotes from revered thinkers. And then there are some parts that were so humorous that I laughed out loud. Every line resonates with tension. It is a wonderful tale. And, to top it all off, it is optimistic.One of the joys of reading this book is that we have the hindsight of understanding it was written in 1950. The author has that that hindsight as well, and there are an additional 23 pages in the paperback edition, written by the author more than 50 years later. These few pages add dimension to an already complete book and should not be missed. I have no doubt that Fahrenheit 451 is now seared in my mind as being one of the finest books I've every read. It gets my highest recommendation. Don't miss it!

But I only saw the last half of it or so, even less probaly. This was interesting, seeing what it might be like in a certain amount of million years from now. But this was nothing special either. The CGI was terrible, movies such as Jurassic Park had better, and that was over 10 years bbefore this was made! The names they gave the creatures were highly laughable at, and even thinking of the few names I remember(which are Flish, Giant land squid, and the other land squid) send me into a short giggle fit.Basiclly, this is nothing extreme. Maybe a buy, but I suggest waiting for it to come on 'Woah Sunday!' again so you can compare it to Mo's side show. Or rent it.

I axiously waited for this CD to come out and was afraid that I would only like the songs I already knew, which is the case many times when you buy an album - you know one or two songs and when you listen to the rest, you are disappointed. Not so with Clay Aiken. I absolutely LOVE every song. Of course I love Invisible and This is the Night, but the title cut, Measure of a Man, really blew me away! If you find the guy described in this song (like I did), hang on to him. They aren't easy to find, but well worth the effort! I just keep hitting the back button! Then I go ahead and play the whole CD over again. I have a six CD changer in my car, but I don't need the other five slots! It is such an upbeat CD. The tunes are uplifting, as are the lyrics. I Survived You even seems to make breaking up seem not so bad. Whether you are in love now or trying to recover from a break up or just want to feel good, you NEED this CD. Clay, when I say I love you, I mean it!

review/text: LORD JIM is the story of an ordinary man who commits what may or may not be an act of cowardice and spends the rest of his life trying to atone for his sin. What makes this story extraordinary is the difficulty the reader has assessing the nature of the original act and then judging whether Jim has been punished enough. Joseph Conrad does not make it easy to gauge accurately either the man or his act since we can see the act filtered only through the lens of a narrator who is too close to the case to be judged reliable.LORD JIM is a novel of adventure and many read it on that basis, but lurking beneath the surface of a simple act is, as in so much of Conrad's fiction, a bewildering complexity of issues that tap into the deepest recesses of why people do what they do and how others can fairly judge them. Marlow is the narrator who attends the trial of a crewman Jim accused of abandoning his ship during a storm when he thought it was sinking. When all the ship's officers leap into a lifeboat they abandon the more than eight hundred passengers below decks. Jim joins them, and all are later picked up by a French trawler only to learn that their ship did not sink and in fact was safely towed to port. All the officers, except Jim, escape punishment either by running away or pleading illness. Only Jim decides to speak out publicly in his defense, but of course there is none, so he is found guilty and stripped of his seaman's certificate as punishment. Marlow sees the trial and decides to follow Jim around the world to get the truth. These are the bald facts, but what Conrad does with them is to invest them with emotional and psychological issues that resist easy analysis.To begin with, Conrad emphasizes Jim's ordinary state of being, by repeating that Jim is "one of us." This statement occurs so often that it becomes a mantra, inviting speculation as to what sense he is one of us. Whoever the "us" is, Conrad implies that the "us" must have had a standard of justice in which one size fits all. No one at the board of inquiry seems particularly upset that Jim was merely following the captain's orders to abandon ship nor that his record was otherwise flawless. The board judged Jim by an inflexible code of honor and found him wanting. Conrad, in his description of Jim as a maritime Everyman (no first name, a flat character who no past, present, and now no future), makes it easy to condemn the board's overhasty verdict to condemn Jim for an act that had mitigating circumstances. As Marlow gets to know Jim, he acknowledges that the more he knows, the less he understands. Conrad sets up a straw man in Jim. Because so many people, including Marlow, hold Jim under so many lenses, the images that result are often contradictory. The only constant is Jim himself. During the trial, and later during the climactic encounter with the natives who call him Lord Jim, Jim continues to attempt to see himself in the simplest manner possible. He knows that he cannot possibly be all the Jims floating on everyone's lips, so he determines to be the Jim who should have stayed on board the deck of a sinking ship. This Jim is willing to take responsibility for his actions. When he unwisely allows the dastardly Gentleman Brown to escape his richly deserved fate, he makes a colossal leap of faith: he will pay now for all sins of his past. In his death, Conrad suggests that this leap of faith may be the only trait that distinguishes reprobates like Brown from ordinary men like Jim who may not be so ordinary after all.

review/text: Infamous Scribblers: The Founding Fathers and the Rowdy Beginnings of American Journalism is the eye-popping true story of how raucous and undisciplined American journalism once was. Feuds, partisanship, and outright lies often colored journalism of the era. Some founding fathers, such as Ben Franklin, Alexander Hamilton, and Sam Adams, were leading journalists, others, such as George Washington and John Adams, passionately disdained journalists; and Thomas Jefferson was a skillful manipulator of journalists. Infamous Scribblers is divided into three sections: "The Role of Authority", "The Approach of War", and "The Tumult of Peace", all tracing the contentious relationship between the founding fathers and journalism throughout the birth of America. Highly recommended for American history shelves, and an absolute "must-have" for public and college libraries.

review/text: I'll keep it short and simple.At least for me, there are moments in life that redefine pain and pleasure. A point that you can use to envy or be thankful for. Like if you won the lottery. I'm sure that every good thing that happened to you from then on would be slightly paler in comparison. You might get a free bun from cinabon and think, "Mmmm, this is a good bun...but it's not as good as that one time I won the lottery.Rollerball is the opposite of winning the lottery. If the lottery was where once a year someone was picked to get puched in the face on world-wide television, and one year it happened to be you, the feeling you would get of dread and unjustice would be close to how it feels to watch Rollerball. Rollerball redefined pain for me. Last month I had a horrible case of the stomach flu and spent most of 2 days staring into the toilet. During that time I was seriously thankful that at least I wasn't watching Rollerball.I guess that is at least one benefit of the movie, and justifies it getting one star. Now all the bad things that happen to me don't seem to be that bad anymore. Car Accident? Well at least I'm not watching Rollerball...Pet Died? At least the pet is in a place where I am sure this movie does not exist...Forget to pay the rent and get kicked out of your appartment? You get the picture.Money spent on paying someone to physically harm you is money better spent than buying Rollerball. Because Rollerball hurts you in more ways :(

review/text: For you hard-boiled detective fans who are also intogeneology, you might like to trace Philip Marlowe's familytree. Raymond Chandler's prototypes for his now famous detective began in the mid-30's with characters from some of his early pulp magazine stories. Whether the character is Ted Carmady, Johnny Dalmas, John Evans, Tony Resick or a character named simply Mallory, they all had the qualities and charactoristics that eventually evolved into what became Philip Marlowe. Red Wind, Trouble Is My Business and Goldfish are just three of more than 40 stories Chandler wrote during his lifetime. Don't miss a single one!

It rushes past like a frenzied nightmare, pausing only for a moment between each of its three distinct segments for a romantic interlude that puts the exclamation point on the rest of the movie. This is the best foreign example of the new wave of unconventioanal movies that include the likes of &quot;The Matrix&quot; and &quot;Go.&quot; The dubbing is not great, but I can't imagine trying to keep up with subtitles in a movie like this.

review/text: If you liked the movie, don't buy this book! It was the worst compilation of meandering thoughts that I have read since, well, since ever. This book left me wondering: &quot;Huh?! What were you thinking?!&quot;But, if you are the ever true believer in MIB (not the movie), black helicoptors, and cow mutilations, this just may be the book for you. If you will accept an explaination for parnormal events, presented in a matter of fact form, as truth, without further explaination as to how such conclusions are reached, then you will accept, probably love, this book. However, for me, a reasonable person, wishing for education, not blanket belief, this book is nothing more than a waste of money. I would gladly send you, dear reader, this book for free, saving you the cost of purchase, but the shipping fee is too great a cost, considering that I may use the book for fuel for a fire to warm me on a cold winters night...It reminds me of the great words of Eric Cartman: &quot;Well, they took me up in their spaceship, and Scott Baio gave me pinkeye&quot;. Your pinkeye, Mr. Keel, was probably caused by rubbing your eyes too much...trying to stay awake while creating such garbage.

review/text: It is hard nowadays to find recordings of Ronald Stevenson's music, but fortunately this cd gives us his most important work. John Ogdon recorded this work (I bet it never made it to the states!) which should also be restored to the catalog as well as Stevenson's other recording of this plus other pieces which he and other artist has recorded. This is Marc-Andre Hamelin type stuff, a 80 minute single movement piece (not as long as Maw's Odyssey for orchestra, but close). However, Raymond Clarke proves to be a formidable talent. I hope that there will be more recordings to come of his playing, but this disc is now 5 years old (I really am sorry I missed it back then) and as far as I know, he has not issued any other recordings. If you are a Shostakovich fan, you probably would think that the composer himself used the theme in all its permutations. However, Stevenson goes farther in assuming the themes many moods by many transformations. Much virtuosity is needed as well as extreme sensitivity and Clarke succeeds with aplomb. The only reservation is the clausterphobic sound quality. I got used to it and what is more important, the music carried me away which is really what a recording is about.

review/text: Having put down "How Few Remain" largely out of disinterest, my yearning for a good World War II alternate history novel (before I learned of "Fatherland" and others) inevitably lead me here.Lizard-like aliens (called "Lizards" by humanity) invade Earth in 1942, expecting to encounter resistance from Earth in the 1600s, so thus they become embroiled in a turbulent version of World War II in which the Axis and Allies must work together to overcome the Lizards.Another reviewer pointed out that little thought was put into the Lizard's technology, which appears to just be a manifestation of 90s-00s military technology. From a certain point of view, that does appear remarkably true, but if it weren't for that reviewer, I would never have thought of that or imagined it as so.The writing is definitely no Steven Pressfield or Jeff Shaara, but it serves its purpose in being easily readable for most reading levels and progressing the plot.There is an immense amount of characters to keep track of, which can be disorienting sometimes, but also add different layers to the book to keep you from becoming sick of one character's tired old plight or whatever. The Lizards in particular are very interesting, and their reactions to humanity's aptitude in adapting is intriguing to listen to.Another major flaw which greatly irritates me concerns the leadership. For the first hundred or so pages of the book, NONE of the world leaders are shown or written about. And if it weren't for the exposition progressing different events, you'd think the leaders all suddenly died in the invasion, and the military and civilian populace is handling diplomacy and war on its own. Indeed, by the end of it, Adolf Hitler appears only once, yelling at Ambassador Molotov over the Jews "betraying" humanity by siding with the Lizards, Churchill acts as representative for Britain in peace talks among the world leaders, Stalin, Roosevelt, Hirohito, Mussolini, and other high ranking leaders (aside from General Patton and General Marshall) don't appear at all. For a story mostly centered around certain characters, this is okay, but considering this is the ONLY alternate history book series dealing with this sort of event, we'd like to see how the world leaders would react!I would like to see Hitler confronting Stalin and being forced to negotiate a peace and try to secure uranium for both countries equally. I would like to see Winston Churchill and Adolf Hitler arguing over military strategy. Instead, they barely ever show the leaders.Not only are the leaders barely shown, but major events happen as soon as they're mentioned. For example, the Lizards debate amongst themselves to make the tough decision to drop a nuclear bomb on Berlin, and in the next section, a character is hearing on the radio how Berlin was bombed yesterday or whatever. This happens a LOT, and it is annoying.The flaws aren't enough to detract from this being a highly entertaining series, with some genuinely likeable characters amongst the massive bunch. Not only are there three more in the series to look forward to, but three more when the Lizard Colonization fleet arrives, twenty years after the invasion...

review/text: Prison break films are a staple of Hollywood and even TV nowadays. They go back to the earliest years of the talkie period. "The Big House" (1930) was the first film to gain wide critical and popular acclaim. Films like Hell's House" (1932), Hell's Highway" (1932), "20,000 Years in Sing Sing" (1932) and "The Mayor from Hell" (1933) followed, as well as the chain gang films, the most famous of which was "I am a Fugitive from a Chain Gang" (1932) and later "Cool Hand Luke" (1967).In addition to the standard prison film and chain gang films, there are a number of other sub genres like "women in prison films" - "Caged" (1950), "Women in Cages" (1973) - and "escape from POW camps" - "The Great Escape" (1963), "The Colditz Story" (1955) - films.Here in 1947 we have a run of the mill escape from prison story, notable only for the quality of the cast that includes Burt Lancaster, Charles Bickford, Sam Levene, Jeff Corey and Howard Duff among the prisoners and Hume Cronyn and Jay C Flippen among the guards. The film was said to be inspired by a 1946 attempted escape from Alcatraz, but in fact the plot points are so ordinary that no explanatory is necessary.Burt Lancaster (1913-94) plays the tough guy and the ring leader of the escape. Lancaster was noted for his athleticism ("Flame and the Arrow", "Jim Thorpe", "Crimson Pirate", "Trapeze" ), his intensity ("Come Back Little Sheba", "From Here to Eternity", "The Rose Tattoo", "Elmer Gantry"), and his marvelous westerns ("Gunfight at OK Corral", "Vera Cruz", "The Professionals" , "Valdez is Coming"), but it's his character studies in this film, "Birdman of Alcatraz" (1962), and "Atlantic City" (1980) where we really see his true power as an actor. This was his second film, coming off a tremendous debut in "The Killers" (1946) at the age of 32.Lancaster was nominated for an Oscar in 1953 for "From Here to Eternity" (1953) and would be nominated 3 more times and win for "Elmer Gantry" (1960). He was nominated for a Golden Globe 5 times, starting in 1956 ("The Rainmaker") and including "Birdman of Alcatraz" (1962) and "Atlantic City" (1980). He appears as #19 on the AFI list of Top 50 Screen Legends.Hume Cronyn (1911-2003) plays a power hungry Captain. He had 7 Emmy nominations and 3 wins ("To Dance with the White Dog", "Broadway Bound", "Age Old Friends") but it probably best known for "Cocoon" (1985). Most of his roles were as "good guys" so it's interesting to see him play the bad guy. Unfortunately he is not all that convincing.Crusty Charles Bickford plays the con in charge. Bickford appeared in nearly 100 films. He was nominated for an Oscar three times ("Song of Bernadette" in 1943, "The Farmer's Daughter" in 1947, and "Johnny Belinda" in 1949), and each time, the actress who played opposite him won the Oscar for Best Actress - Jennifer Jones, Loretta Young, and Jane Wyman.Fellow inmates Sam Levene and Jeff Corey appeared in "The Killers" with Lancaster. Both men were a staple in film noir and gangster films. Levene appeared in "Crossfire", several "Thin Man" films, and "Slaughter on 10th Avenue". Jeff Corey appeared in more than 100 films ("Butch Cassidy", "In Cold Blood") and best remembered for his role as Wild Bill Hickock in "Little Big Man" He was blacklisted in the 50s and became an acting coach to such notables as James Dean, Robert Blake, Leonard Nimoy, and Jack Nicholson.Jay C Flippen (1899-1971) plays a guard. He appeared in more than 50 films between 1929 and 1971. He was often paired with Jimmy Stewart ("Winchester 73", "The Far Country", "Strategic Command", "Firecreek") and .John Wayne ("Jet Pilot", "Flying Leathernecks", "Hellfighters"). In the 50s he transitioned to TV where he was a regular on series like "Ensign O'Toole" (1962-3) and "The Virginian" (1966-9).This was the film debut of Howard Duff (1913-90) who is probably most famous for his TV series with wife Ida Lupino, "Mr. Adams and Eve" (1957-8). In the film credits he is identified as the "Voice of Sam Spade" which he was at the time for NBC Radio.Jules Dassin (1911-2008) directs. Dassin did a number of film noir movies ("The Naked City", "Thieves Highway", "Night and the City") before getting in trouble during the HUAC witchhunt and left for Europe where he made "Rififi" (1955), one of the earliest heist movies. In 1961 he was nominated for an Oscar as director and writer for "Never on Sunday".FWIW - Jules Dassin, Hume Cronyn, Jeff Corey, Roman Bohnen (played the warden), and Art Smith (played Dr. Walters) all were blacklisted.William Daniels (1901-70) is the cinematographer. Garbo insisted he shoot all her films, which he did, except for 2 ("Conquest", "Two-faced Woman") which turned out to be flops at the box office. When not working with Garbo, Daniels was a favorite of Erich von Stroheim, who was Garbo's favorite director (even though she made 6 films with Clarence Brown). Daniels lensed more than 150 films. He was nominated 3 times ("Anna Christie", "Cat on a Hot Tin Roof", "How the West was Won") and won once ("Naked City" in 1948). Unfortunately this is one of his poorest efforts.Miklos Rozsa (1907-95) scored more than 100 films and earned 16 Oscar nominations and 3 wins ("A Double Life", "Spellbound", "Ben Hur"). A talented composer, his work in this film is so melodramatic it borders on the comical.1947 wasn't the best year for films. The Oscar winners were "Miracle on 34th Street" and "Gentlemen's Agreement" and the box office leaders included "Unconquered", "The Bachelor and the Bobby Soxer", "Mother Wore Tights" and "Life with Father." Other notable films that year were "Dark Passage" (Bogart), "The Lady From Shanghai" (Orson Welles), and "Possessed" (Joan Crawford).The NY Times' Bosley Crowther criticized the characterizations, saying "the foremost prisoners in this latest Mark Hellinger film seem to be rather all-around good fellows who deserve our most generous regard" and "On the other hand, the warden of the prison is an obvious ineffectual, the doctor is a philosophical drunkard and the captain of the guards is a rogue."There are lots of problems with this film, apart from the poor production values.It's called "Brute Force" but there is really very little force, much less brute force. True, one inmate is forced to stumble into a stamping machine and another is tied to a chain and beaten with a rubber hose. But that's it folks! And there is almost no internal violence, nor any sense that this isn't a safe place to be, apart from the Captain and his one violent aide.Moreover, the idea of showing back stories is intrusive helping to slow down the pace of the film, which isn't all that great in the first place.This film is a big disappointment, considering how talented the actors are and considering that this was 1947. If you're looking for good prison escape films, here are my favorites - "I am a Fugitive from a Chain Gang" (1932), "Each Dawn I Die" (1939), "Cool Hand Luke" (1967), "Papillion" (1973), "Midnight Express" (1978), "Escape from New York" (1981), "The Shawshank Redemption" (1994), and "The Escapist" (2008)

review/text: There are money-making opportunities in the financial markets, but the first thing an investor should do is ignore much of what comes out of "Wall Street." The investor should especially ignore the phone call from the new MBA at a brokerage firm pushing some hot new stock that is supposedly "about to take off." The stock is being pushed because of the size of the commission on any purchases. If the stock is so wonderful, does the broker have it in his or her own portfolio? Next week, some other stock will be "about to take off." The investor can also expect a call from a broker saying that their mutual funds or municipal bonds perform much better than what the investor is in now. How about a switch? More transactions equals more commissions. Wall Street does not do anything for free. Even if something sounds "no fee" or "no-load," the brokerage will get its fee somewhere.The investor should certainly keep up with the business news, but do not spend hours and hours every day at it; that will not leave any time for actual trading. Go through the Sunday paper and come up with a list of buying possibilities. These are May Buy stocks, as opposed to Will Buy. Just some basic information is needed about each stock, like its 52-week high/low and yesterday's close. If a stock is down at least 20% from its 52-week high (not 19.5%), move it onto your Will Buy list. When choosing a broker, is it really worth going through several minutes of Press 1 and Press 2, before you reach a human, while the price of your stock goes in the wrong direction, all to save a few dollars on the commission? Pay the extra commission, and choose a broker where a human really is just a phone call away.It is easy to buy a stock, but much harder to know when to sell it. If your stock rises from 20% to 10% below its 52-week high, sell it. Do not get greedy, and wait for it to rise just one more point; it may never come. There will be other opportunities. Besides, a double digit profit in the stock market is nothing to scoff at. On the other hand, if your stock continues to slide into oblivion, know when to cut your losses. There will be other stocks.This book seems to be much easier to understand than the stock trading "systems" advertised on TV and in the Business section of the local book store. The experienced investor may kick themselves, realizing the money they have given to Wall Street, for little or no reason. It is also recommended for novice investors, and even non-investors (like yours truly).

review/text: I think that The Cannabis Grow Bible: the definitive guide to growing marijuana for recreational and medical use by Greg Green is probably the most valid and important marijuana cultivation guide to hit the shelves, ever. The reason why I highly recommended this book to growers is because of the sheer volume of factual cultivation information as opposed to growing myths, stoner ramblings and old information.A book like this one really depends on how well it can be put into practice and I will stop short from calling this book the ultimate guide because I want to see more from this writer. If you have never tried to grow marijuana before or have had bad results then use this book to get you there from start to finish in no time. This is the one thing that really stands out about this book. It gets you there very quickly and with good results. Growers who are looking for a more experienced grow book should not miss this opportunity to turn a trick at adding a few pounds to their grow room by attempting some of the advanced techniques featured here. This is the high yielder surprise book that I got as an early Christmas present.[There is a breeding chapter which sets a new standards for books of this type. It explains how to stabilize a line of genetics using breeding techniques. I can not understate the important value of this grow book to me.]

review/text: While Ernst Cassirer provides an illuminating analysis of the nature of myth in The Myth of the State, he never tells his reader what the western myth of the state is. Extrapolating from his analysis of Plato, Augustine, Thomas Aquinas, Machiavelli, Carlyle, the racist Gobineau, Hegel, et al, what emerges is the unfolding of a theory of the state, not a mythos of it. The passionate and emotive elements of myth, which Cassirer brilliantly explicates about myth in general, are never made explicit in his analysis of the theory ("myth") of the state (except at the end when he discusses Nazism). If anything, these elements are subsumed in the content of his analysis.Nevertheless, Cassirer masterfully explains much of the development of the western theory of the state through time. He hits on many of the salient thinkers and philosophical movements. Yet, inexplicably, some important thinkers seem to get short shrift comparatively speaking (e.g. Aristotle) and others scarcely manage more than a brief mention (e.g. Marx). Readers might find (what turned out to be) Cassirer's parting shot at Heidegger and the proto-fascist elements of his philosophy fascinating (Cassirer died in 1945 and The Myth of the State was published posthumously). Perhaps most intriguing is how Cassirer reserves most of his ire for Hegel, arguably making his philosophy most responsible for the intellectual underpinnings of the rise of National Socialism in Germany--an analysis not entirely unpredictable for a neo-Kantian like Cassirer to make given how, in the historical estimation of many, Hegel eclipsed Kant as Germany's preeminent philosopher.Notwithstanding these limitations, The Myth of the State is worth reading. Cassirer's analysis of the development of the western theory of the state is evidently too sagacious to be missed.

review/text: It may be hard to believe that there were classic family films created in the 60s by anyone other than Disney. This movie is an example of a very good and classic family film, one where the only car chase is after a lion, there are no video games to be seen anywhere, and the central themes of the movie are love and that wild things should live free.This movie is based on a book by Joy Adamson by the same name, and chronicles her and her husband's experiences with a trio of lion cubs. Eventually two of the cubs are sent to a zoo, but the third lion, a lioness that Joy calls Elsa, remains with Joy and her husband George. Of course, lions are wild animals and they can live with people for only so long, and Joy is faced with the need to have Elsa sent to a zoo. Joy is unable to think of Elsa being caged when she has been free for her whole life, so she attempts what had not been done before, repatriation of a captive lion back into the wild.Elsa and her husband work long, hard and with a lot of frustration, despairing that Elsa would never be able to go back to the wild, or that she would die as a result of their attempts. All along the way you can see Joy Adamson's love for Elsa and her need to see Elsa be able to return to the wild.Andy Williams sings &quot;Born Free&quot; to accompany the end of the movie. This song is one of Andy Williams' best. If you are familiar with this song you will recognize portions of it are used throughout the movie as a recurring theme.This movie is simple and heart-warming. There are a few moderately violent scenes, but I would consider this movie appropriate for children of all ages, though with parents watching when the youngest family members watch.

review/text: Due to the recently released Doom 3 and the upcoming Everquest 2, I bought this card for my latest computer build.Backed with 1GB PC3200 RAM and an Athlon 64 3200+ processor, this card rips though Doom 3 with all the effects on at 1024x768.THE MOST IMPORTANT THING THE BUYER NEEDS TO KNOW is that you should download and use the OMEGA DRIVERS in place of the Catalyst drivers that ATI gives you with the card (you'll need to search for them on Google, as I don't believe Amazon will allow me to post a direct link). It will save you a LOT of trouble, especially if you're planning on playing games.The Omega Drivers also add a bunch of useful tweaks that can enhance your video card. For example, RadLinker, which you can access by right clicking your desktop, going to properties &#62; settings &#62; advanced &#62; RadLinker, allows you to overclock your card with a simple slide bar. However, this card is functioning too well at it's current speed for me to risk anything/void the warranty, so I've left mine the way it is.

review/text: When I read Into The Wilderness last year, it ended up being one of the top ten books I had read in 2002. Naturally, I was really looking forward to this second book in the series to continue where I left off with Nathaniel and Elizabeth.In addition to loving the relationship between these two characters, I was also drawn to the setting of Hidden Wolf Mountain at the edge of the New York wilderness. Sometimes I wonder why an author chooses to change the setting of a book when that locale was obviously so successful in the first place. In Dawn on a Distant Shore, Sare Donati forces the reader to accompany the main characters first to Montreal and then on a ship across the ocean to Scotland. This took away from my enjoyment of the book. If I wanted to be in Scotland, I'd be reading Gabaldon's Outlander series and not this one.With all that said, the main crux of this story is for Donati to get across to the reader how persecuted Catholics were in Scotland in the late eighteenth century and how important it was for them to keep their lands away from the Protestants. To this end, she has Nathaniel finding out that his father, Hawkeye, is a descendant of the Scott's of Carryckcastle in Scotland and the Earl of Carryck is very eager to have Hawkeye come to Scotland to claim his line in the family tree. In doing so, the lands of Carryck would pass on to Hawkeye's son Nathaniel upon the death of the Earl and would consequently remain in the hands of the family....Catholic hands. Needless to say, Hawkeye and Nathaniel have no desire to reside in Scotland so the Earl has no choice but to kidnap Nathaniel's children forcing him to come to Scotland to be reunited with his family. Have I bored you enough yet???A major part of this story takes place on various ships getting to and from Scotland. Ever since I read Moby Dick, there's nothing I like less than reading about ocean voyages. The other major section of this book takes place in Scotland and I like that even less because you have to try to decipher the Scottish accent when reading. Instead of having a cast of characters and some maps at the beginning of the book, I'd much rather have a dictionary explaining what some of the Scottish words mean. It took me forever to figure out that "ken" means know, "na" means not and "tae" means to.The good news is that the next book in this series, Lake In The Clouds, actually has Nathaniel and Elizabeth back on the land they know and love. It also brings back many of the characters Donati's readers enjoyed in her first book, Into The Wilderness. Based on this, I look forward to this next adventure and only hope that Donati has no plans to return her characters to Scotland...they don't want to go there and neither do I with this series.

review/text: My husband and I rediscovered this film when I discovered it was available on your site - I had remembered enjoying it as a child but was thrilled to see it again as an adult - Gemma Craven is a delight as Cinderella and the songs are charming - while Richard Chamberlain is young and handsome and the "ideal" Prince Charming - the only drawback is the length of the film, which might be long for younger children, but it is a delight for all family members. My personal favorite song is Protocategorically correct, which seems very Gilbert and Sullivan-ish, while my husband loves What a comforting thing to know.You will not regret your purchase if you love musicals and you are looking for something "safe" for your children or even you to watch - and which does NOT insult your intelligence like most children's "entertainment" does today.So Amazon and public television - when are you guys going to find the archives and get Gemma Craven's performance of Jerry Bock and Sheldon Harnick's SHE LOVES ME which was shown on PBS during the seventies with Robin Ellis as her Jimmy Stewart(Shop Around the Corner)/Tom Hanks (You've Got Mail) type penpal.

As I am a GREAT fan of C.S.Lewis' and Tolkien's writings, I was fascinated to find that both these author's drew a lot of their inspiration from MacDonald's writings. I have since read &quot;The Princess &amp; the Goblin&quot;, &quot;The Princess &amp; Curdie&quot;, &quot;The Golden Key&quot;, and &quot;The Light Princess&quot;.

review/text: I was excited to come across Lene Gammelgaard's book as I love to read about women who share my taste for adventure. Imagine how disappointed I was to find that Ms. Gammelgaard could not write about anything outside of herself. Yes, I know it is a personal account of climbing Everest, but her trip was not a solo ascent. From her account though, you would think no one else was around. Okay, perhaps that is a slight exaggeration, but I was pretty tired of Ms. Gammelgaard far before the end of this book. Additionally, her writing style is quite disjointed and distracting. I find it difficult to believe the claim that she has &quot;been a journalist,&quot; unless you understand that to include anyone who has, perhaps, simply kept a journal.If you want to get a feel for being a woman and climbing, better to try Stacy Allison or Ruth Anne Kocour. You will get much more rich detail from either of those, along with more of a sense of the community of climbing.

review/text: I am a big fan of classic horror films...although not necessarily of the source material the films were based on. Add to that I've only read a few Koontz books in my lifetime and I went into this book with a lot of skepticism. In this re-imagining of the Mary Shelly works, the Frankenstein Monster, called Deucalion, has survived and is leading a quiet life in a Tibetan Monsastery. He's secreted away from the rest of the world, safe and sound. He then learns, however, that his creater Victor Frankenstein is alive and well, and living in New Orleans, mad as ever.Frankenstein is now a rich Tycoon, and is up to his old tricks of creating life, and hell-bent on replacing mankind with his laboratory spawned creations. Unlike the Lighting created patchwork of corpses, these new creatures have been created with the latest technology and been essentially grown in the lab, and designed to be perfect. When one of these "perfect" creations escapes and becomes a serial killer, Deucalion will actually join forces with a couple of cops to hunt down the creature and Frankenstein.This is an interesting and intriguing take on the Frankenstein mythology. It's not Karloff and James Whale to be sure. The original monster owes much more to the original Shelly story. This monster is intelligent and thoughful and it is his creator who is the true monster. The characterizations of the monster and Freankenstein are well done and interesting. I thought it was perhaps a bit overlong and bogged down in some spots but overall I enjoyed the book.

review/text: I've read other books by Gabriel Garcia Marquez and have enjoyed them. This one left me cold, however. The story was very muddled and Marquez wrote in such a matter-of-fact style that there were no ups and downs. It was like watching a heart monitoring machine. Whether someone was being executed, eating lunch, or anything else, Marquez just stated everything very matter of factly. Also, the names in the book were far too similar for the average reader. I just wonder if the people who give this book great reviews are doing it on its own merit or whether they are afraid to break from the pack. It reminds me of the Emperor's New Clothes where everyone was afraid to admit that they didn't know the emperor didn't have clothes on for fear of looking stupid. Of course, it could just be me. I look for things that have a real plot or a real end they're striving for. I didn't find it in this book. I also found the spiritualism hard to believe such as Remedios the Beauty ascending into the heavens. That's a bit much for even a romantic person.

review/text: The comon view of opera is recitative=drama, arias=music, and therefore not drama. Kerman makes a different (and therefore genuine) claim. he says that in opera the music IS the drama. To illustrate this, he enters a thorough venture in the world of opera, from the first masterpiece - Monteverdi's &quot;orfeo&quot; to wagner and modern operas. The work includes a discussion of the works of such giants as verdi and mozart, and also a critical look at the Leitmotive technics. Kerman is imaginative, provocative, write in a clear language. altough the book demands a background in opera appreciation. It does not demands a musical background. To some it is almost &quot;the bible&quot; of opera understanding. A master achievement.

review/text: This book originally came to my attention when I saw it in Publisher's Weekly. Now that I've read it, I'm stumped by their recommendation. Until I saw (to my shock) so many reviews here, I would have said this book has no life outside of maybe a writer's workshop. Even the publisher seems resigned to not selling the book, based on the horrendous cover they stuck on it. Who would look at that and pick it up?I mention writer's workshops because that's all I can think of when I read this: an author aware of but not absolutely in command of techniques and styles, playing with language like a toy, to the detriment of character and story. In one scene where Jim and his uncle pull into the big city of Charlotte in the middle of the night, he writes, &quot;Streetcars floated all around them. The streetcars were sound asleep, and Jim hoped the truck wouldn't wake them up.&quot; Jim's ten years old. He is too old to believe streetcars might really &quot;wake up,&quot; and too young to think metaphorically/poetically. That's the author's voice. He frequently puts things into his characters minds and mouths that don't belong there, and all it serves to do is distance the reader.The situation did get better once Jim got into school. I suspect playground politics are familiar to all of us, and those parts came more naturally. Also the moments just before Jim figures out that his uncles are only teasing him about one thing or another are always quite nice. There's a lot of potential with this family, and the scenes that do work well only make me wish he'd taken me deeper into them, without the book itself getting in the way.Ultimately it's a not-unpleasant book, with the biggest problem being the constant awareness of the author's hand. He was an extra character in every scene (Like that Visa commercial, I could hear his voice saying, &quot;What I was trying to do here was...&quot;), and he kept me from really getting inside the story. I hadn't thought of it as children's literature until so many reviewers mentioned it, but maybe that's really what it should be.

When I heard that soul coughing released lust in phaze, I thought that was a great idea since I did not own any of their albums so I figured that Lust in Phaze would provide a good introduction to the band. After buying and listening to the album. Lust in Phaze covers soul coughing's career from Ruby Vroom to El oso. It also includes unreleased songs like Casiotone Nation peformed live. There is also the song from unmarked helicopters from Songs in the Key of X.Overall, the album provides a really great history of a band that should have been given more attention for its great music.

review/text: This is a book by Gerald Heard. Catchy title, no?The book starts off rather well. It proposes that man must make the next step in evolution - mental/expanded consciousness - or degenerate or destroy himself. Note that Heard wrote this around the start of WWII.The pain and sex in the title has to do with excess energy present for doing this next step that we are failing at doing, hence problems with these. The time part is that it is an illusion - not much done with this that I noticed. He seems to say that when we are intellectually occupied, we are less worried about sex, have less sensitivity to pain and are not as aware of time - he may be on to something here.Heard then reviews history (including evolutionary history of life) to shown that his points have merit. There are some interesting items here.Things get a little sketchy and hard to follow near the end - even his sentence structure gets hard to follow - when he starts talking about how to achieve the next step. His method is hard to explain, but it based on explicit effort in special communities. Apparently, he even attempted to found one in California in the 1940's which did not catch on - this is not to say that his ideas were wrong.Heard was a rather interesting character - see the biographical information in the book. He was friends with Huxley and involved in the Vedanta Society. Meditation was very important to him in later life.Worth a read, but be prepared to trudge through some rough spots, especially towards the end. The summary at the very end is fairly informative about the book as a whole.I had very high hopes when I started it, but kind of lost them in many respects as I finished it.

review/text: There are certain aspects of this production that are very good, & other aspects that are not so good. Pros: the locations & scenery & color are terrific. If this is not Sherwood Forest, then it seems like it could be. The locations are realistic, castles seem period appropriate, & so do costumes, utensils, & customs. Unlike other productions, I do not hear the hollow sound of plywood while the actors are walking on stone floors or earth. This production has invented its own unique personalities for Robin's band of outlaws, as some previous productions had. Some of these work well (Marian, Sheriff, King Richard, King John), others don't work well at all (Will Scarlet, Friar Tuck), etc. The element of mysticism & paganism (especially Herne the Hunter), although not seen in a Robin Hood telling before, do seem appropriate for the time period. There is a degree of reality that is missing from most earlier versions (bad guys sometimes do get killed here, instead of just being wounded). Cons: the acting leaves much to be desired; some of the actors are quite competent but others need more work. There is entirely too much screaming; screaming does not equal emoting, & much of it rings hollow. The script-writing is sub-par; some words (particularly "idiot") are used countless times in each episode. Some of the dialog sounds out-of-time (for some reason, "What's up?," heard in two different episodes, doesn't have the ring of medieval England). The plots in the first season are too simplistic & often redundant. There needs to be more of Robin's outlaw band (even as minor players or extras); it seems like there are only eight outlaws here, not enough to be "realistic" (that is, according to the legends, some of which stated that the Merry Men numbered over 100). There is much in the way of action scenes here, but it is not well-coordinated & the stunts need improvement (part of the problem is that the actors do much of their own stunt-work, & it's evident in terms of slowness, lack of agility, & lack of reality). A sword fight & stabbing in this production usually looks like it's at the level of young boys playing make-believe, & comes off as phony. Overall, a worthwhile production which is fairly good, but could have been much better. The episodes greatly improved starting with the last show of the first season, & the notable improvement continued throughout the second season. The Robin of the first season was replaced by Robert, Earl of Huntingdon, played by a different actor. Viewer's opinions are divided on which actor is better, but what has significantly improved is the writing (dialog & plot), the action choreography, & continuity. The second season's shows are not redundant, are more interesting, & even returning actors seem to be doing a better job by not being quite as over the top as previously. For me, watching the first season's pitfalls made me enjoy the second season all the more. 3* for the first season, 4* for the second season.

review/text: The tale of The Hound of the Baskervilles has such sturdy bones that it's probably the most filmed of the Great Detective's cases. Let's see...I've watched at one time or another Richard Roxburgh, Peter Cushing, Basil Rathbone, Jeremy Brett, Peter Cook, Matt Frewer and Ian Richardson play Holmes as he pursues the solution to this monstrous plot. One or two I've enjoyed less than the others. One was really grim; an attempt at comedy that had many things but humor, unless you find uproarious a chihuahua with the bladder the size of a bull mastiff's urinating on a person's foot.With this version, Ian Richardson plays Holmes, Donald Churchill plays Watson, Martin Shaw plays Sir Henry Baskerville and Denholm Elliot plays Dr. Mortimer. Grimpen Mire continues to play Grimpen Mire, and that dark, fog-swept Dartmoor bog is not a place you'd want to venture into, even if a slavering hound weren't bounding after you.Just to restate the plot: Sherlock Holmes and his friend Dr. John Watson are visited in their rooms at 221B Baker street by Dr. Mortimer. Mortimer tells Holmes the story of the Baskervilles and the curse that was laid upon them. Mortimer's best friend, Sir Charles Baskerville, has died under suspicious circumstances. Now the heir, Henry Baskerville, is arriving from Canada. Mortimer believes Sir Henry is at risk and pleads for Holmes to intervene. Holmes says he cannot leave London for a few days, but agrees to meet Sir Henry. Homes then agrees there are unusual aspects to the case and has Watson accompany Sir Henry to Baskerville Hall. Watson is to report back by mail until Holmes can arrive. And now we enter the world of swirling fog, of nights without moonlight, of swamps that can suck an unwary man under, of servants who seem too silent, and of neighbors...a brother and sister who live near by. Then there is the unnerving howling of a great beast to be heard late at night.Richardson gives us a Holmes who smiles a little more than we're used to. He's just as analytic and perceptive, but seems more understanding of human foibles that, say, Rathbone's or Brett's versions. Because the story is so inherently dramatic, however, as long as the actors are accomplished the issue of who's a better Holmes isn't all that important. It's not a zero-sum game, where if you prefer Rathbone, for instance, then automatically Brett must be diminished. While I might prefer one over the other, I think Richardson, Brett, Rathbone and Cushing all give satisfying performances and I enjoy each of them.This version, like the others, has first-rate production values and solid acting. The one thing that bothers me is that Donald Churchill as Watson comes perilously close to the Nigel Bruce School of Acting. Churchill doesn't make Watson the elderly buffoon that Bruce turned Watson into, but he makes Watson far more obtuse than necessary to help the story.Since there was a rapacious Baskerville ancestor, since there were suspicious deaths, since there was a great hound, and since there was an unscrupulous murderer, I don't think I'm giving anything away by quoting Dr. Watson's last line in the movie. "The curse of the Baskervilles," he says to Holmes, with a shake of his head, "...a figment of the imagination." Or Holmes' last line. "Without the imagination," he says with a smile to Watson, "there would be no horror."The DVD looks fine. There are no extras.

Here is what you are about to get:1. The book claims that CD ROM has 8 model test + one real CAT. While it is true, test questions repeat throughout the tests. SO, do not bothe rto take model tests, go straight to the CAT because that is what you are really after. Otherwise, you will be disappointed to see the same questions again. Nice thing though is that if you re-take CAT it randomly pull squestions out of the pool. So, you just win here in any way.2. I took the full CAT and when it was time to score it, the program just HUNG. Very diasppointing. I unloaded the CD ROM to my hard drive and retook the test. This time it worked fine, however, my READING results were horrible. I could not believe it and retook just reading section, as it does not allow you to review the results after you have taken the full test. My results were VERY low again, so I checked out what kind of errors I made, and realize dthat I was being graded against WRONG paragraphs. Basically they a problem with their software.That said, be careful, if you know what you are fater, get the book, it is pretty good, but be very cautios about CD ROM. Oh, this review is about the book with CD ROM not with four audio CDs.

review/text: SDRE is a two sided coin. The first side encompasses their first two albums; raw, bleeding-heart, tortured, love-obsessed, low-fi. The flipside represents the latter half of their albums; grandiose, poetic, sweeping, accomplished, passionate. Both sides have a common theme; emotion.The first album after the band's break, "How It Feels to be Something On," stands as their most accomplished and possibly best album. Jeremy's vocals have improved. His lyrics: more thematic. Surprisingly, the band sounds tighter than they ever did during their emo-pioneer days. They introduce their progressive rock roots here, as well, something they had only previously hinted. As a result, the album plays very much like a rock opera. If the song lyrics were linked by a story, it could rank with "Tommy" and "The Wall" as one of the great concept albums. Regardless, it still FEELS like a concept album and as a result, requires some attention.The arena ready opener "Pillars" reintroduces us to the band. And the progressivness of "100 million" and the mid-Eastern tinged "Roses in Water" reveal the band's new game plan. Though lyrically not as Christian-based as LP2, Jeremy is still obviously influenced by religion on the aforementioned "Roses" and "Prophet." There are a few tunes that sound like first era leftovers (Days Were Golden and Two Promises) but the band had never really branched out in this way before. They even attempt what can only be described as a break-out-your-lighters acoustic ballad with "Every Shining Time You Arrive." Taken as a whole the album is amazing. Oddly, the band sounds ready for stadiums, even though radio-friendly songs like "8" and "In Circles" are nowhere to be found. But that's a small quibble. The album is great.Overall: 9 out of 10.

review/text: Miserable Keanu Reeves film that is one of the worst movies ever made. Keanu is more than miscast in this film, he makes the film a real chore to watch with his horrible acting and lousy delivery of his lines. This is not his fault because he can be a good actor when he has the right material but he's not working with a full deck here and he's as bad as the film itself. The rest of the film is as bad as he is with a story that makes no sense and direction by music director who does not know the hell he is doing with the movie he's making. Some plot points go no where in terms of furthering the story a long and certain revelations don't makes any sense at all with the overall story. The special effects are not handled well and you really can't see much of the movie at all with how dark it is. Only Rachel Weisz and Peter Stormare do well with what they got and they both make this film bearable with their better than the script performances. Weisz deserves all the praise she is getting for her performance, and that's really because she's does give a better performance than the movie as a whole and Stormare does well with his ten minute cameo and does a better job with his role than most of the actors in the entire film.Now I have not read the comic book on which this film is based on but I hope it's a hell of a lot better than this lousy film.

review/text: John Cena is perfect as the former marine who goes on a rampage to rescue his wife from killers. The movie moves fast and its slick production and sets adds to the visual eye candy.My only beef is with the WWF empire that produces these Wrestler-turned-Action Star movies. The WWF gave us Stone Cold Steve Austin in THE CONDEMNED which was fun and Austin was great. But like THE MARINE, we see almost zero of the world famous torsoes of these super heroes. In THE CONDEMEND, Austin never takes off his shirt for one scene. And he has a body to die for. in THE MARINE, you've got about l5 seconds where we see Cena without his shirt and his body is amazing. But after that, he's fully covered. The reason I worship these wrestling super stars is because they're so damned good looking and they don't mind strutting their stuff in a pair of speedoes. One can only hope that the next WWF action thriller will give us a super star wrestler who exhibits his chest --like Schwartzenneger, Stallone, Von Damm--and give us fans something to thrill to.

review/text: I tried on several more expensive backpacking boots before settling on this one. I have high arches and this boot fit and felt the best. I've put 70-80 miles of backpacking on the boot, including some hard, heavy miles. So far the boot is holding up fine. And they feel great - like I'm walking on cushions.The only downside so far is the leather has worn more quickly than I expected and the waterproofing seems to be wearing off - even after an additional waterproofing treatment.Update:My left boot stopped being supportive after about 90 miles of mid-weight backpacking (with 30-40 lbs). These boots are probably just not durable enough to rely on for backpacking.

review/text: I tend to run away from any book that Oprah recommends. I mean I love her but if she recommends a book it suddenly turns into a piece of mass consumption and ceases to be a true piece of literature. In fact, it is fairly upsetting that the reason this book is now being read by &quot;the masses&quot; (I am using another reviewer's words here) is because Oprah suggested so.With that said, this book is magnificient. I read it five years ago in English and am about to read it in Spanish. As a Spanish Speaker I can gurantee that the translation is by far the best translation I have encountered in books to this day.This book /can/ be a hard read for people not familiar with magical realism or Marquez at all (and his circular writing style). If you are looking for an easy read this is not it. If you are looking for a rich, beautifully crafted piece of literature then get the book.Still unsure? Do a quick search online for the book and you will find the countless awards this book received (not to mention the fact that Marquez won the Nobel Prize in Literature in 1982). It is often listed on the best books of the 20th century.I was sad when the book ended and have reread it since.

review/text: The OdysseyThis movie was really good. It is the best movie I have seen in school. Some of my favorite characters are Athene (Isabella Rossellini), Odysseus (Armand Assante), Calypso (Vanessa Williams). The movie started off with Odysseus being called to fight in the Trojan War. It had good effects of how they hide in the horse. Odysseus ran into a lot of mythological creatures. Some of them helped him and some tried to make his trip back to Ithaca really hard. I liked the way Vanessa Williams played Calypso. She is a really good actress. I also liked the effects of Poseidon (Miles Anderson) it was really good how they had his face on the wave since he is the god of the sea. The best part to me is when Odysseus gets home and shoots the arrows through the twelve axes. I also like when Odysseus and his son fight the men who want to marry Penelope. It is really good when he hits everyone with an arrow and he hits one man going out he door to escape and the arrow goes out of the man and hits the woman I think who is suppose to take care of Odysseuss son. This movie was really and I hope to watch it again in school some other time.

review/text: We must never forget what happened on September 11, as individuals and as a nation. A book like this is one that our grandchildren will be looking at years from now while we describle the feelings and horror of that time.LIFE magazine, as usual, could be counted upon to chronicle, in photos and text, these sad and devastating events. The photos are exquisitely painful and the text (some by Guiliani, and poems by Maya Angelou and Charles Parks) is achingly appropriate.Reading this today, nine months after our national tragedy, made me realize that while the rawness of grief has somewhat lessened, it will never be gone.

review/text: This book was assigned reading for me back in college 12 years ago and I have been thinking about ever since then. Last week I finally broke down and decided to re-read it and see if it was as fascinating now as it was then.It is the story of three male adventurers who discover an unknown land that is virtually impossible to get to inhabited only by women. Scientific and curious by nature they plan a mission to fly over the country in a plane to investigate further only to be captured and held prisioner in &quot;Herland.&quot; While captive they are tutored by and taught to speak the language of the inhabitants. Once they have mastered the language they learn that their captors do not mean them any harm, but rather want to learn from them about the outside world as they have been cut off from it for 2000 years by their natural barriers. The men learn from the women and the women learn from the men. We see how different life could be in a society ruled and inhabited only by women.As a utopian or fantasy novel, this one is outstanding. There were parts I liked better and was more appreciative of now that I am older than when I first read it, and others that had me thinking &quot;as if!&quot; If you can get past the whole parthenogenisis premise its an easier pill to swallow, but this time around I wasn't buying it. I also found the over zealous religious tones near the end to make this short novel drag out far too long.All in all I am glad I re-read it and encourage anyone who hasn't to do so.

review/text: For years the concert film "Ziggy Stardust And The Spiders FromMars" was infamous for its grainy visual look and absolutelyabysmal sound mix, which was particularly bad on the first foursongs. Which was a shame, since the concert was clearly excellent, featuring Bowie at an early performing peak with his "Ziggy" concept. Now, at last, with this 2003 rereleasethe film has been given a just sound remix by DA Pennebaker, whoexplains why the sound had always been so bad on previousreleases in the accompanying booklet.The difference between the old and new versions is literally night and day. Now the sound is spectacularly loud and clear,in 5.1 surround--I never knew it would *ever* sound this good.This increases one's appreciation of the concert 500%, and shows The Spiders From Mars to have been a great backing group, with Ronson of course a particular delight on his solos for classics like "Moonage Daydream" and "Width Of A Circle". The entirefilm is an homage to the glory days of glam-rock, when fanatical UK audiences would dress up in the glittery makeup and outfits of their rock idols and act out each line of the songwith them; the audience is truly a sensational thing to beholdin this film, as they seem completely mesmerized, almost as if they were under hypnosis (on the other hand, Angie Bowie's briefcameo at the beginning shows her to have been a supremelysuperficial, self-serving and annoying presence!).Every song is a classic, with some like "All The Young Dudes", "My Death" and "White Light/White Heat" that never made it onto a Bowie studio album, and others like the climactic "Width Of A Circle" that were greatly expanded. Bowie's androgynous outer-space image--replete with lightning-quick costume changes and some lurid interplay between himselfand Ronson (kneeling and licking the guitar during a solo, and so forth) was a phenomenon at the time and still pretty legendary, although in actuality the spectacle was relativelymodest compared to the concurrent antics of Alice Cooper orGabriel-era Genesis. But it is the audience which probably lingers on the most after every viewing--the like of which has never been seen since.The film also comes with a bonus poster, although personally I would've taken it without, at a lower price.

review/text: Galbraith's insight on society unfortunately gets lost in a maze of double negatives and confusing sentence structure. His ideas are sound, though he has a very off-putting pompous delivery. In fact, his verbosity and poor structure is so bad, that it turns what should be a slim read into a fairly mind-numbing experience. The book really needs to go back to an editor.

review/text: Do you like Clutch? Because if you do, you'll recognize a lot of that band's sound here. Thick, heavy grooves? Check. Gravelly, wailed vocals? Check. Thumping rhythm section? Check. Massive guitar riffs and fuzzy lead work? Well, you get the idea. However, past the Clutch resemblances, there is a lot that makes this album interesting. Joe Selby is an outstanding guitarist who pulls off an enormous array of sounds. Opener "Fear Death By Water" demonstrates the range of his abilities right off the bat, with a combination of monster riffs and addictive slide guitar work. Other, slower tunes see him branching out into acoustic work, with Dan Kerzwick bringing his vocal energy down a notch to match. The band mixes harder tunes with the slower and softer stuff for a while after "Fear Death by Water," until it reaches its peak towards the end with the monstrously heavy "Red Colony" and "Rumor Den." There aren't any truly weak songs on here, and the diversity of the songs keeps "Seed of Decades" from ever getting boring. I look forward to more good things to come from this band.

Some parts soar, others drag, but one could say that about almost any biographical work that rings true. I've found one other memoir that more thoroughly nails shut the whole (surprisingly huge) "teaching in Japan from the male perspective" genre, but Feiler's book fills in a lot of blanks for those who wonder what it's like to live and teach in Japan, and does it in an engaging manner.

review/text: Okay, so she's no Meryl Streep but Madonna is not a bad actress! This film proves it. She does a fine job as does the rest of the cast. But, she isn't the centerpiece of the movie, so I really don't see why all the slings and arrows from critics are about her acting. The movie does a good job provoking thought about the issues it explores: what is the definition of a &quot;family&quot; in our society today, should a convention family be the mold we all follow, should a gay man have as much parental rights as a straight man etc. There's a good blend of comedy and drama. The movie is no &quot;Titanic&quot; but it's still good entertainment, a nice diversion. Fun in the beginning, sad towards the climax, touching by the end. Immitates real life quite a bit. It should fare much better on video.

review/text: This is without a doubt one of the top 20th century novels, and as such, very much has been written about it.Some clasify it as an epic, while others try and find all the symbolism and deep meaning behind the story of Macondo and the Buend&iacute;a family.Let me just say that more than a great novelist, Garc&iacute;a Marquez is a great observer. As a colombian, I can honestly say that the events depicted in this well written novel are not as far away from our reality as might seem at first. Things like the ones descibed here do happen in small &quot;conte&ntilde;o&quot; (from the coast) towns throughout Latinamerica in general.I am sure that for quite some time Gabo had a laugh at the expense of all who searched for the real and inner meaning of Cien A&ntilde;os de Soledad, and who wrote innumerable pages full of interpretations.This book is simply the story of a town as told by a grandmother to her grandson.You either love this book or you hate it, and if you hate it, it's because your world is too small and simple and you do not have the imagination it takes to understand this as an account of my &quot;bananero&quot; country's reality.Do not miss this book.

review/text: "Blow" is based on the true story of George Jung (Johnny Depp in one of his best roles), the loving son of a struggling businessman (Ray Liotta) who, as a child, upon seeing his family struggle to make ends meet and witnessing his mother's (Rachel Griffiths) resentment for his father because of their low income, vows to never be poor. Thus ensues Jung's descent into the world of drugs. He begins his three-decade rise and abrupt fall as a drug lord smuggling pot into the US in his early 20's during the pot-crazed 60's, which garners him an enormous amount of cash. After landing a lengthy jail sentence, he meets Diego Delgado (Jordi Moll&agrave;) in jail who introduces George to the far more profitable world of cocaine dealing. He soon shoots to the top of the game and his biggest problem becomes where to put all of his cash. It is said that if you used cocaine during the 70's and 80's, there's an 85% chance it came from Jung.Over the years he struggles with a crack-addicted wife (Pen&eacute;lope Cruz as you've never seen her before), the relationship with his young daughter, and maintaining his relationship with the only person who truly cares for him in the world, his father. Additionally, Jung is portrayed in a sympathetic light as a nice guy who just makes some bad decisions. Usually I disagree with this type of "glamorization" of criminals, but I feel that in Jung's case it is truly deserved."Blow" is not only the fascinating, pulse-pounding, and historically informative chronicle of the rise and fall of one of America's most influential drug lords; it also the exploration of some very deep personal connections, such as very deep father/son connection between George and his father. In addition, George's love for his daughter, who ends up being the single thing motivating him to stay alive throughout his jail sentences, delivers a powerful emotional impact in the film's final scenes. I also appreciated how director Ted Demme delicately showed us the parallels between George's mother's resentment for his father and George's wife's resentment for him after he loses most of his money as well as George's struggle to be a good father just as his own father did.The final scenes of "Blow" are surprisingly moving, which ultimately distinguishes it from all of the other crime films out there.

review/text: I am not a big fan of non-fiction history books. I find them hard to concentrate on because there are so many facts that they become overwhelming. But We Are Witnesses is a non-fiction history book that I liked. First, I liked it because it was set during WWII, which is something I am interested in. Secondly, this book is about five teenagers, which I can relate to because I am in the same age group. Each of their diaries was found. They all were Jewish, they all died.In We Are Witnesses there are five main characters, David Rubinowicz, Yitzhak Rudashevski, Moshe Flinker, Eva Heyman, and Anne Frank. There is a whole chapter on each one of them. They all have the same big conflict, the Nazis. The Nazis forced the Jews to move into a ghetto, and each character had to do that. They all lived in different parts of Europe. They all had money issues. But each one was unique in their own way. For example, Yitzhak joined a club that would meet and do research projects, and learn a few new things. This was Yitzhak's favorite time of day. Eva Heyman admired her mother and wanted to be just like her. Each day was a struggle to live. There was barely enough food for any of them to eat. They all had to put their faith in God, that He would save them from the power of the Nazis.Each character had their own religious beliefs but Moshe Flinker's was the most unique of all. He believed that if the Germans kept on taking over more land and the Jews kept on being killed then, when it seemed like all hope was lost, God would save the Jews from the Nazis. Moshe Flinker's story also was one that stuck out in my mind because he almost made it to Vichy France, which was a part of France that was not taken over by the Germans. Another memorable story was when David Rubinowicz was forced to move from his house and into a ghetto, but he many times was able to walk to his old house. One of the times he witnessed a Jew getting shot right in front of him.From the very beginning of the book, the author tells that all of the characters die. They all did, but their life stories will be something that you never will forget. Overall I would recommend this book to anyone who likes non-fiction history books. There were very good parts to the book but also some bad parts. The bad parts were where it got confusing. For example, when the author got into too much detail about a character's life. Also when Moshe Flinker tried to explain his religious beliefs it got very confusing. Although I knew the deaths of all the characters were certain from the beginning, I wanted to read this book because these people had to live with fear every day. But each one was strong enough to not let that fear get to them, and tried to live their lives like you and me.

review/text: This is certainly an entertaining novel, and it will keep you turning the pages. But Ms Gregory has a few of the facts a little muddled, and as history is always stranger than fiction, I do have to wonder why she chose to change anything about this fantastic story. For example, Ann was Mary's younger sister, not elder, and this may have put quite a different spin on their relationship. Mary's son Henry was her first born child, not second. And finally, there was absolutely no evidence that Ann ever committed incest with her brother George, and the book hints very heavily that this was indeed what happened.I guess we can just pass this off as historical fiction, and Ms Gregory certainly does do this well, painting a vivid image of Ann as a young woman who gambled all and lost, and endangered her family in the process. But this was a well documented time in history, and whereas I am willing to give historical authors a lot of leeway with characterisation, I do like my facts to be right.It is a ripping tale all right, and it is well written, but I still found myself disappointed with the liberties taken with the facts.

Ruby Ann has enlightened me on the finer things of life - how to make a gingerbread trailer for special guest kinda entertainin'; a cigarette butt Christmas tree - no festive Yuletide is complete without one or two in the ol' double-wide; a macaroni picture frame - the perfect gift to show your family and friends that you truly care!As if all this wasn't enough, Ruby Ann delights us with the comings and goings (and occasional gossip) of the denizens of the High Chapparel Trailer Park.Pity there are no trailer parks here in NYC(well, perhaps the Manhattan Plaza qualifies as a high-rise trailer park). People up here need to know the gadzillion uses for cream of mushroom soup and duct tape.

review/text: a reviewer below me called the storyline to this movie "a jumbled mess". oh my, how wrong he is. although, i will admit... i did not fully understand the storyline to this movie for TEN years. that doesn't mean it was a jumbled mess, though. it only means that my feeble mind wasn't able to comprehend the depth, detail and layers to it at first. so, TEN years later (2006) i watched it for what was probably the 20th odd time, and i FINALLY understood all of the twists and turns in the storyline and it all came together so beautifully. it was like poetry. it was one of those moments where you sit back and say to yourself "how in the hell can someone write something so ingenious?". so anyways, my point is: this movie has depth. it has layers upon layers upon layers. this is nothing like MI2 or MI3. this is a thinking-mans movie, and it is aesthetically beautiful in a very artistic way. each time you watch it, a new part of the story will reveal itself for you. and that's why i think this is the best M:I movie in the series BY FAR. compared to this one, the other two subsuquent sequals are loud, unintelligent and highly forgettable. like another reviewer said before me... this is one of the best action films i have ever seen. get it.

review/text: I have to laugh at the negative reviews of this book. They are probably written by socialists who don't understand economics, otherwise they wouldn't be socialists. Hazlitt's arguments are based on (1) a real understanding of economics and (2) facts, including that socialism has been an abject failure where ever it has been tried. In contrast, the arguments of modern liberals are based on emotions and are devoid of facts and of thinking about the world as it is.I can tell you that this is one of the very best books that has ever been written on economics.

review/text: In a letter to his confidant and friend, Wilhelm Fleiss, the then middle aged neurologist, Sigmund Freud, was in the midst of researching and writing his beloved 'dream book'. He wrote the following:&quot;Now I have finished and am thinking about the dream book again. I have been looking into the literature and feel like a Celtic imp.&quot;Oh, how I am glad that no one, no one knows...&quot; No one suspects that the dream is not nonsense but wish fulfillment.&quot;Indeed, this is the premise of Freud's entire thesis: dreams are no more than repressed unconscious wishes, battling for expression and consummation.In his own words, Freud had 'dared' to rally against the 'objections of severe science, to take the part of the ancients and of superstition.' In 1900, the official year of the book's publication, its reception, despite its provoctive title, was tepid, and in the course of six years, only sold 351 copies. Freud never gave up hope, and 30 years later, in the preface of the third English edition, he wrote, &quot;It contains, even according to my present day judgement, the most valuable of all the discoveries it has been my good fortune to make. Insight such as this falls to one's lot but once a lifetime.' In present day, one can question any Freud scholar about ~The Interpretation of Dreams~ and they will say the same thing: the book contains everything that 'is' psychoanalysis.Anyone interested in the history of psychoanalysis and the mind of Sigmund Freud, reading this book is an absolute must. The reading runs along too, quite easily, as Freud was an excellent writer: his unique prose style even shines through some clumsy translations.If you are interested in the book's process of development, I would suggest reading ~The Complete Letters of Sigmund Freud and Wilhelm Fliess~; another gold mine for understanding the growth of psychoanalysis.

My wife was doing her residency while she was pregnant, and we just couldn't sign up for regular classes. This video really prepared us for our son's birth, and answered a lot of questions we had. While covering all the basics and some of the complications that can happen, it tries to keep you grounded, so that you don't panic when something does happen. Highly recommended.

review/text: You can judge a film by the company it keeps, and amazon's always spot-on recommending technology tells me that fans of 'Nowhere in Africa' are also interested in the following current releases: Hotel Rwanda; A Very Long Engagement; Bad Education; and Million Dollar Baby. Since I've seen and am enthusiatic about each of those, I'd like to suggest that fans of any of those films check out 'Nowhere in Africa,' which is richly deserving of its 2002 Academy Award for best foreign language film.Pay no attention to other critiques on this page about needing to understand German, or about not being able to understand the subtleties of the dialogue because it's not in English. That's hogwash. The subtitles here are excellent, as is the acting, most notably by Juliane K&ouml;hler and Merab Ninidze as lead protagonists Jettel and Walter Redlich. These are great actors who skillfully portray every nuance of their actions and feelings in a way that transcends any language barrier.My only complaint is that director Caroline Link could have been a bit more judcious about the editing process. At 2 hours 21 minutes, the film feels about 15 minutes too long and drags at stretches. That's a small quibble in the face of the overall quality of this production.

review/text: I purchased this book with the idea that it could be a good reference guide for a student I have been working with. I would have returned the book if I could have. Although it is focused toward the wandering teen, it's ideas are too scarce. The ideas within are not necessarily focused to any one religion, but a mix of all the different aspects that the author has put together as wicca. This is a choice that is made by the practicioner, and nowhere in this book does it stress this opinion.For those who would like some fun reading about what fantasy religion could be, this would be the book for you. For those who really need some insight into pagan or wiccan religion/spirituality should look elsewhere.

From Lin Carter's "Green Star" series to John Norman's "Gor" books there are tales of the man from Earth traveling to a strange new world and having wondrous adventures. John Carter was a gentleman of Virginia who finds himself looking at his dying body in an Arizona cave. Opening his arms to the planet Mars, Carter is suddenly whisked to the Red Planet, where rival tribes battle while the planet's atmosphere continues to dissipate. Captured by a band of six-limbed giants, Carter soon earns their respect for his prowess as a warrior and forges a lasting friendship with Tars Tara&#8217;s of the Tharks. But then the Tharks attack a fleet of airborne vessels and capture Dejah Thoris, the Princess of Helium, the greatest city on Barsoom (as the Martians call Mars). Of course, they get off on the wrong foot, since Carter knows nothing about the culture of the red humanoid race. But the lovely Princess of Mars has captured the Virginian's heart. Abandoning dreams of returning to Earth, he wants nothing better than to win her love. In the meanwhile, he has to protect her from the amorous attention of the depraved ruler of the Tharks, bring some semblance of civilization to the barbarian tribes, and stop all out war between the green men and red men from ending Barsoom's last chance for survival."A Princess of Mars" is the first of eleven novels in Burroughs' Martian Series, which seemed to avoid the pitfalls of some of ERB's lesser Tarzan novels. If Dejah Thoris is not the most beautiful woman in the history of fantasy and science fiction, then she certainly has the all-time best name. John Carter is able to take advantage of the Red Planet's lesser gravity to do great feats of leaping about, but it is his innate intelligence and intense sense of personal honor that make him almost idealistically noble. When I first read every ERB novel I could get my hands on in Middle School, Tarzan was always Tarzan, but there was something about John Carter that somehow made him the greater hero in my eyes. Maybe it was the way he handled a sword or how he was always determined to make Barsoom a better place that made him seem Burrough's finest creation. Certainly you will find ERB's most imaginative work, including the great game of Martian Chess, in this series. Do not stop at the first book, because while these novels are fast approaching being a century old, they hold up much better than the writings of Jules Verne or H. G. Wells.

review/text: At some point, Ray Bradbury states in his novel `Fahrenheit 451': `The good writers touch life often. The mediocre ones run a quick hand over her. The bad ones rape her and leave her for the flies'. Bearing this in mind, it is doubtless that Bradbury is included among the good writers. In his novel, he managed to create a parable about the intellectual wakening of a man and the dangers of censorship, in a society where people are not allowed to think.In an undefined future, the firemen job is to start fire. They are supposed to burn books, and the houses of people who keep published material. Guy Montag is a fireman who has never questioned the pleasures of burning, until one day when out of curiosity he takes a copy of a book home and together with his wife he tries to read. However, they have never read a book, and while they can read, they are not able to understand, to connect the sentences. This is just the awakening of Montag's mind. We know there is something about him, and that he won't be the same until we reach the last page.Rather than being far fetcher Bradbury created a timeless story. Things like those describes in the book have been happening for ages. We may not literally burn books, but books, newspapers and magazines are burnt everyday. Like he describes in the book it began with one minority ripping one paragraph, then another, then one more... until the day that it would be better to burn the whole book. We live in the age of minorities, and we should watch out some request.The present edition is followed by an `Afterword' and a `Coda' written by Bradbury in first person. In the first he tells specifically about this novel, the process of writing and once more give voice to his characters to talk about themselves and they world they --and us-- live. In the second part, the writer talks about how timeless his novel indeed is. These two last chapters are very clarifying and help a lot in the understanding of the book. My suggestion is: read this novel, think of it, and see how the world can be one day. And then do your part to avoid things in this book becoming real, because `Fahrenheit 451' can be anything, but far fetched.

review/text: A few years ago there was a HK movie called Lady in Heat that became a hit- why? Mainly due to the lesbian scenes involving Penthouse HK star Miho Nomoto and Rebecca Chang (spelled Rebeca on the box, not sure which is correct). Because of this, a &quot;photo album&quot; of sorts was whipped up starring both Nomoto and Chang.The packaging of this video just screams &quot;hey! lesbian content!&quot;, peppered with shots from the Lady in Heat scenes. I got this specifically because I liked Lady in Heat, and there were vignettes within the film that indicated there were more scenes that hadn't been used.Unfortunately, they aren't in here. This is a series of vignettes illustrating photo shoots and the like, with the girls mostly apart. When they're together, they're very posed and still- not interacting, and really not doing anything sensual. It does explain away some of the &quot;glamour&quot; shots that were used on the promo postcards included with the HK DVD release of LiH.The few lesbian scenes in this are shots from Lady in Heat, and are cut up; nothing new for the LiH fan, and too incomplete to be of much use for the lesbian-scene fan.Overall a very soft-focus lingering look at both Miho and Rebecca, like something from the early Playboy videos- very tame- in fact, nothing below the waist is ever shown. Worth it for the Miho fan (of which there are a few.) Might also create a few Rebecca fans- she's really cute and it *is* nice to have a bit more with her, even if it's just topless cavorting.Other miscellaneous complaints: The mastering of the video leaves something to be desired; the scenes where Miho's standing in front of venetian blinds and the camera goes in or out glitches quite a bit. The promo postcards present in the HK release aren't included here. The nave-voiced narration is hard to hear over the cheesy synth music, and when it can be heard, is incredibly banal. The quality is basically that of a higher-quality camcorder, which makes the cuts to the film-based Lady in Heat clips jarring.

review/text: "Motor City Moments" is Regina Carter's 4th CD and it is amazing to listen to. It opens with an uptempo, improvisational-like, number, "Don't Git Sassy" then settles into a contemplative, salsa tune "For Somoeone I Love," where Carter plucks her violin then make it laugh, weep and glide all in one song. I haven't heard the Milt Jackson version, but it would be interesting to hear the original to see how this interpretation is different. There also some interesting selections like "The Love Theme from Spartacus." Carter's lamenteous violin is softly accompanied by Marcus Belgrave's flugelhorn. In some instances, the two instruments merge into one sound. But the ultimate gem in this CD is Carter's version of Chattanooga Choo Choo. It should be a standard violin piece much like Mozart's Sonatas. It sounds like it was written for the violin and Carter is in absolute command here, with such fire and fluidity, I'm definetly impress! One should buy this CD just for this number alone.

review/text: A fantastic, hip, and energized look at a young woman (Lola, of course) who must raise 100,000 DM in 20 minutes before her boyfriend Manni, who has to answer to a gangster about a large sum of money that he mistakenly left on a train. Run Lola Run literally runs right from its MTV-inspired opening credits, using a striking mixture of incredible lighting, quick editing, and animation to give a unique feel to late 90s Berlin (it is also a somewhat more optimistic picture of Berlin than the Berlin of Wim Wenders' Wings of Desire, which the film alludes to in its opening moments). The result is three different looks at what Lola's adventure might turn into. Fantastic on every level, the direction is both quickly-paced (perhaps a little too quick in parts) and yet never fails to involve the audience. All of the characters emerge into full people through each "scenario." Incredible as it might sound, however, this film could have used some tighter editing, notably in the (rather trite, it must be admitted) scenes where we learn of Lola's father having an affair with a co-worker. I am unsure of what this subplot brings to the film other than a few laughs. As I said, the direction is tight and quick, but when the film slows, it slows for a reason, revealing character. Lola's flaming red hair will help you keep focused on her running when the camera segues to its aerial shots.

review/text: This is my favorite book of all time.Lots of reviewers are complaining about the scientific accuracy of the novel. Hello! The book was written in 1984! That was 20 years ago! Science changes every day.Besides, watching a national geographic special on neanderthals doesn't may you an expert on human evolution. So unless, you're a physical anthropologist or a microbiologist. Please be quiet.The Earth Children's series has impacted my life in two ways: It's why I minored in lingustic anthropology in college (I actually wrote a paper on the Neanderthal language) and why I got a dog (Wolf is the best).Ayla is amazing, I suppose a little too amazing at times, but she is really a symbol of major milestones in human evolution and culture (domestication of animals, usefulness of flint in starting a fire, the idea that sex makes babies, and an explanation for the extinction of Neanderthals (they intermated with modern Homo sapiens).My favorite Earth Children's in order...1)Clan of the Cave Bear2) The Mammoth Hunters3)Shelters of Stone4) Plains of Passage5) Valley of Horses (just get through this, it's worth it)

review/text: The Burning Bush is essential reading for anyone interested in a deeper understanding of the Bible. This large volume is filled with amazing insights. It combines the author's own life-long search for the deeper meaning of the Bible with the discoveries of Rudolf Steiner (1861-1925), the founder of Anthroposophy (The Wisdom of Man). The book unveils what people have had to believe only through faith. In a series of penetrating essays the author explains such mysteries and seeming contradictions as the accounts of the Nativity, the nature of the second coming, and the meaning of the Burning Bush.

But even more than that, Whitney displays a pastor's heart on these pages, urging his brothers and sisters onward toward the Christian life to which we are called in Scripture. This is not a difficult book to read by any means, but what it calls us to do is a lifetime mission. Buy this book, read it over and over - maybe once a year - and pursue spiritual discipline! Doing so will help you grow more and more like Christ, slowly but surely.

review/text: I first saw this film when I rented it with a &quot;buy one get one rental free&quot; coupon, so I obviously didn't expect much from it. I saw the fancy cover art and thought it would be a short, inane film that wouldn't hold my interest. I was so incredibly wrong, and after I finished the film, I couldn't wait to go out and buy it. &quot;Run Lola Run&quot; is sheer brilliance from start to finish, never letting your attention drift from the action on the screen. From the pounding techno soundtrack to the incredible camera angles and effects, the film is a wild ride to say the least.The plot involves the loss of 100,000 marks by a scatterbrained wanna-be crook named Manni who also happens to be the boyfriend of Lola. If Manni does not deliver the 100,000 marks to his gangster boss, Ronnie, in 20 minutes, Manni will be squashed like a bug. From here, the action begins. Lola frantically tries to replace the money for Manni, and she encounters many obstacles along the way. The most mind-blowing part of the movie is the alternate endings that show the various ways Lola must try to come up with the money.I was wondering how the filmmakers would stretch this film out to feature length, considering the plot begins and ends in 20 minutes, but they have done a masterful job of it. Simply put, &quot;Run Lola Run&quot; is not to be missed, it is one of the best foreign films you will ever see!

review/text: For years Mykel Board had wanted to go to Outer Mongolia. He realized that dream in 1995 when he went there to teach English at the National University in Ulaanbaatar. EVEN A DAUGHTER IS BETTER THAN NOTHING is the result of his stay. This volume is not like any other travel writing you will read. It is at once hilarious, I suspect at times hyperbolic as well as downright moving in places. He writes with obvious affection for the people he encountered on his year there; and even though he lands in a country far removed from anything he has even encountered--"this is Mongolia"-- he is never condescending.Public transportion doesn't run on time, the plumbing doesn't work, classes are scheduled in the wrong classrooms, and signs saying someone takes credit cards usually don't mean that at all as Mr. Board repeatedly hears the mantra "this is Mongolia." What the writer does find is a lovable people not afraid of hard work and accepting of strangers. They dress up to have a photo taken, are offended if you do not eat their food-- even though you prefer not to eat unadorned fat-- poor Mr. Board at times reminded me a little of Cool Hand Luke's stuffing himself with eggs in the movie by the same name-- and can drink you under the table. These folks drink vodka like Americans drink Cokes. (I'm surprised that Mr. Board had a liver when he returned to New York.) He also found "Pro Wrestling, rock'n'roll, Christianity, and probably someday soon, McDonalds." But apparently no designer coffee shops yet.Although Mr. Board describes himself as a good instructor-- and I believe him-- he on several occasions uses incorrect English, always making the same grammatical error: "He wimps out, leaving Sebastian and I stranded" (p. 270) is incorrect. The sentence should read "leaving Sebastian and ME stranded" But you'll find much weirder stuff here. How about half a page of information on Mongolians as "snot-blowers"? Finally you'll read a long time before another travel writer refers to Peter North. (Oops. I'm not supposed to know that he is a famous porn star.)For those of us who will never go to Mongolia, Mr. Board has made a part of the world come alive, reminding us once again that all of us are more alike than we are different.Oh, about the title-- the author says that he wanted something catchy to get the reader's attention-- he is most successful-- but explains that the expression is an old proverb that has little to do with modern Mongolia.

review/text: Asimov's classic series has a quaint, nave simplicity about it that never fails to entrance this reader. For all its episodic construction (unavoidable, considering the unparalleled scope) and its rather flat, exclusively male characters, the Foundation Trilogy takes readers back to a time when America was making the world safe for democracy, personal freedoms were a given, and science seemed to be the salvation of a fallible humanity.The first volume, Foundation, sets up the whole idea of the Seldon Plan, a mathematically based view of sociopolitical forces that enables one brilliant scientist to mold a new galactic empire from a foundation of one hundred thousand scientists and their families. After the introduction, whose final paragraphs subtly lay out the whole structure without our knowing it, we get to see the Plan in action as the Foundation faces a series of political and military crises. Because the scientist/hero is long dead before the second chapter, the heroes are the political and economic, rather than scientific, leaders who must resist the temptation to take direct military action, and instead allow events to proceed until Seldon's Plan points out the answer. The magic of this book is the exquisite means the Foundation uses to defeat its enemies without resorting to force, and the convincing arguments Asimov uses to make these solutions seem inevitable. As such, each chapter is like a sociopolitical puzzle that challenges the reader to find the move that will defuse each situation, and taken together these stories comprise a virtual primer in diplomacy.Countless millions of fans have enjoyed Asimov's Foundation Trilogy, consisting of Foundation, Foundation and Empire, and Second Foundation. Other Foundation novels, written by the master in his later years, lack the simple charm that makes these earlier works so popular. They were tacked on solely because the power of those first three created a demand that Asimov felt obligated to try to fill, but they have an entirely different feel, and don't possess that single-minded surety of artistic vision that marked the original series.This book is about political maneuvering, not action, so it may not be a favorite of action/adventure fans, although the next book in the series, Foundation and Empire, is a little more dynamic, and reading the complete Trilogy is a must, since the first two volumes don't so much end as just leave off. Still, the vast historical vision begun in this book is so sweeping, it should not be missed by any fans of speculative fiction.

review/text: This is a wonderful genre bending book...part mystery, part history. Written by Scotswoman Elizabeth MacIntosh, who wrote under the pen name Josephine Tey, it was first published in 1951. It is tragic that the author died in 1952 and was never to know the pleasure that this book would bring to generations of readers and that the Mystery Writers of America would ultimately rank it fourth among the one hundred best mysteries ever written.The title of the book is derived from a historical source, as it is attributable to Sir Francis Bacon, "For truth is rightly named after the daughter of time, and not of authority." The book itself is not a traditional mystery but rather an application of deductive reasoning to an actual historical event. The event in question is the murder of the princes in the tower, sons of King Edward IV, allegedly by their uncle, Richard III, who eventually usurped the English throne after the death of his brother. It has been widely held that Richard III did, indeed, murder the two young princes, his nephews, in order to secure his claim to the throne.The reader is introduced to Scotland Yard Inspector Alan Grant, who is hospitalized and recovering from injuries sustained in the line of duty. While convalescing, he becomes intrigued by a picture of a portrait of Richard III, a likeness with which he is unfamiliar. Grant is puzzled that someone with such a sensitive face could have been such a monster as to murder his two nephews in cold blood. So, our intrepid Inspector decides that he will reconsider the evidence upon which such a dastardly assumption has been based. With the help of an American researcher doing the necessary legwork, Grant compiles enough archival historical fact that incrementally helps him formulate a new theory as to who actually may have murdered the princes in the tower.This analysis and reformulation is done as though it were being argued to a jury. Indeed, so persuasive is Inspector Grant through the application of some insightful deductive reasoning and clever dialogue that the reader comes away thinking that Grant has solved one of the most intriguing historical mysteries of all time. This is certainly an unusual book conceptually but one that succeeds brilliantly. It should appeal to those readers who enjoy having a mystery unraveled, as well as to those who harbor a love of English history.Derek Jacobi gives a lively and spirited reading. He positively shines when reading the role of Detective Grant and gives a most persuasive characterization. It almost more a performance than a reading. The only slight problem is that when incorporating the role of the American researcher into the reading, his American accent falters a bit. Despite this small issue, however, his reading of this brilliant work is one of the most engaging that I have ever heard in an audio book. Bravo!

review/text: I previously watched the movie The Odyssey. The Odyssey is a story written about a man named Odysseus. This story was written by Homer a Greek writer. Odysseus was played by Armand Assante, I think he did a great job. After the Illiad the first epic by Homer The Odyssey starts. The Illiad is about Odysseus fighting in the Trojan War. In the Odyssey, Odysseus upsets the god Poseidon (Miles Anderson). Poseidon tells Odysseus that he wont make it home for a longtime. On Odysseuss journey home he encounters many creatures &amp; people. He meets one of Cyclops (Reid Asato .) Aeolus then gave Odysseus a sack of wind. When they had Ithaca in their sights one of the men opened the sack of wind and it blew far away from Ithaca. As Telemachus gets older his mother has to be wed another man. Athena tells Odysseus that she can change him into an old beggar. Then only Telemachus could know who he was. When he comes into the town of Ithaca he sees that the men have destroyed his town. His son had grown his beard so he had to enter the ring. He fought one of the men wanting to marry Penelope. Then she decides to make a challenge for the men to find out who will marry her. The man who can string Odysseuss bow and shoot it through the axe handles would win her hand in marriage. It seemed impossible to the men, then the old man strung it and shoot it perfect.This movie was historically correct in a couple of ways. The characters wore tunics made of wool. The people were fishermen, herders, and warriors. As they did in real life the people believed in many gods, and believed in sacrificing animals. The people grew olive and the woman pressed them. It took place in Ancient Greece. As it was believed in Ancient Greece you must bring presents to the persons they are visiting. The hostess was expected to board and lodge them. This movie was a good action packed thriller.

review/text: I have read through the other posts for Prairie Wind, and everyone's comparisons of Priaire Wind to this Neil album or that Neil album - always a waste of time with any artist that grows older and changes with the time. I do understand some of the frustration of some of the listeners - you can't always follow even your favorite artists through all of their phases. Heck, I lost Springsteen in the 80's, and have only enjoyed his two acoustic albums since (I don't even want to talk about Devils and Dust). But we are discussing Neil's new album . . .I found it comforting, emotionally moving in its personal touches (especially his thoughts on his dad), and Falling Off the Face . . . is simply a beautiful love song from the perspective of a man who struggles to make his emotions known. The only thing that bugged me a bit was using the orchestration a little heavy handed on too many of the tracks. I prefer the raw sound. I honestly cannot reccommend a better fall album than Prairie Wind, and I look forward to grabbing my lawn seat this summer to watch Ol'Neil givin' it to us live. For those who missed the Greendale concerts, I am sorry to tell you that you missed one of the greatest performances of any musician in the thirty years that I have been attending concerts.

review/text: Back before all news came filtered through a television lens, hard working men and women travelled to remote locations and put themselves in harm's way to write eyewitness accounts of history for newspaper and magazine readers. This fascinating book is full of such accounts, from William Shirer's account of the 1938 Munich Conference (including his brush with a swaggering Hitler) to fascinating reports of the fall of Paris by A. J. Liebling and Virginia Cowles, to Edward R. Murrow's descriptions of war-torn but defiant London to Ernie Pyle's moving tales of soldiers in the trenches of Africa and Sicily. This book offers a unique glimpse into World War II by the people who were there, who lived through the extraordinary as well as the ordinary moments of that war. Included in this volume are incredible snapshots of the American homefront, including a report from a Japanese internment camps, as well as a &quot;report on mass murder&quot; in German concerntration camps by Ed Murrow in 1942, long before most Americans had any idea of the true horror of the holocaust. This volume explores all aspects of the war, and, as such, is an incredible historical document as well as a fascinating read. Highly recommended!

Without further ado:A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man was my entry point to James Joyce's oeuvre, and it was a brilliant one. As an aspiring writer, I identified every step of the way with Stephen Dedalus' maturation, both as a person and as an author. Joyce's unforgiving treatment of his alter-ego's (i.e., Stephen's) flaws was refreshing, as far too many writers of autobiographical novels (I'm looking at you, Charles Dickens) present overly heroic versions of themselves as protagonists. I then moved on to Ulysses, which proved to be a serious test of endurance and willpower. What I understood of the book I enjoyed; what I didn't understand of it ensured I'd enjoy it even more the second, third, fourth, and who knows how many more times around.Then came Finnegans Wake--I skipped Dubliners at the time, for some odd reason. To call it a "disappointment" would be like calling Bernie Madoff "dishonest": bluntly put, it was the most regrettable experience of my reading "career". I wanted to like the Wake--I swear, I really did. I wanted to brag about how I'd finished the book reputed as the most difficult ever written, and, to boot, ENJOYED it. But it was not to be. I did all I could, short of using a reader's guide, which would have felt like cheating (plus, I'm of the opinion that a book that doesn't make sense without a companion guide doesn't warrant the effort of reading it with one). I read the whole thing aloud to myself, to make sure I'd catch as many of the subtle phonetic easter-eggs Joyce crammed into the work as I could. I spent as many as five minutes on single pages, trying to make sense of it. I noticed textual in-jokes here and there, and paused in self-congratulation at being able to decode them. But all to no avail. The best part of reading the book was when I finished it.I've heard all the arguments in favor of the book's merit. I've known people who profess to have enjoyed Finnegans Wake. I've heard what Harold Bloom's said about it. But it doesn't matter to me. The fact is, if nobody had told me that James Joyce wrote this book, I'd have scoffed at it and never given it a second thought--and quite frankly, I doubt this book would have ever been published in the first place if it hadn't been penned by one of the world's foremost writers. I was able to discern who the characters of the book were--HCE, ALP, et al.--and there were some portions of the book that seemed like vestiges of logic in a massive sea of insanity. I know how much work Joyce put into Finnegans Wake; I know how many people have praised it; I know that every bizarrely construed non-word and multilingual pun was carefully crafted and is not the gibberish it appears to be. But the fact is, this book made for a largely joyless reading experience, and thus I have no choice but to give it 1 star.I won't deny that this book is the work of a genius--sadly, I'm convinced it's that particular genius' weakest effort. Only one person in the world knows all the secrets of the book, and that person, unluckily, died two years after he finished writing it. Perhaps if I knew the intended meaning underlying every single quirk of this book, I'd like it--I guess that's why Joyce considered Finnegans Wake to be his masterpiece, after all.

review/text: The stranger is about a man who has no emotion and is indifferent to the world. In the beginning, the man's mother dies, and he doesn't show any feelings. Next, he meets a girl but won't tell her that he loves her. Later, the man kills an Arab on a beach and is put in prison. While in his trial the man is bored and is eventually sentenced to have his head cut off. While waiting for his execution, he tells the chaplain that he doesn't believe in God and never will. The book ends with him in prison, waiting hopelessly for his execution.I did not particularly like this book. It is boring to read a book when the character has no emotion. I also thought that there wasn't enough action and that the ending was pointless.

review/text: There are thousands of books available on American History, some with narrow focus, some painting broad pictures. Based on my sampling of these books over the years, I have found that no series has provided a better overall history than the Oxford History of the United States. The only flaw in this series is that it is only being slowly produced, with only five volumes thus far (with around a dozen or so projected).Chronologically, Restless Giant is the last in the series, covering the years 1974 to 2000, or essentially, Watergate to the Bush-Gore election. This is a rough period to write a history of for a couple reasons. For one thing, it is too recent to get any sort of historical perspective; the detachment that time provides is not there (for example, the 2000 election is still the source of debate, with people on one side or the other about who really won). In addition, while this was an eventful era, it lacks that single event that defines it. For example, previous books focused on the Revolution (The Glorious Cause), the Civil War (Battle Cry of Freedom) and the Great Depression and World War II (Freedom from Fear). Only Grand Expectations (also written by James Patterson) is also lacking the single, focusing event in its history of 1945 to 1974.But as Grand Expectations proved, however, Patterson is good at overcoming these issues to write a book that is both informative and entertaining. Restless Giant is similarly high quality. The primary topic is political, and a good portion of the book deals with the various Presidential administrations during these two-and-a-half decades, but Patterson goes further to discuss various social trends.With politics being so important, we see the many conflicts between left and right. Generally, this was an era of conservative ascendancy, starting with the post-Watergate nadir of the G.O.P., Reagan/Bush in the middle of the period, the "Republican Revolution" of the mid-1990s, and, of course, Bush 43's controversial elevation to the top office in 2001. Of course, this is similarly a period of decline for liberalism and the remnants of the New Deal. Is this a good or bad thing? Patterson remains objective enough to provide no real answers; he is critical enough of both right and left to provide ammunition for either side.Of course, in a 400+ page book, there are going to be a lot of things missed, but Patterson catches most of the important things. All in all, this is another top-notch volume in the Oxford series.

review/text: If you're looking for a video to workout along with, this is probably not going to be what you're looking for. If you're looking to learn a few moves, you might pick up a few. Atea is extremely stiff through the entire video, and sometimes looks unbalanced. You can't see hers or the dancers' legs much of the time sometimes due to camera angles, mostly due to costuming, so you're not always sure you're executing the move correctly if you don't already know what you're doing. At the end of every section Atea and the other 2 dancers behind her simply &quot;improv&quot; a little dance using the moves taught. You can't see what everyone is doing through the &quot;improv&quot; sections so it's not like you could pick one dancer and imitate her, so you will have to do your own thing, fast forward through it, or improv yourself. I don't think most beginners want to make things up as they go along after only 5 minutes of being shown 3 moves. The section on veil work doesn't tell you much of anything at all, it just shows you different women dancing and spinning. For a beginner who doesn't know how to execute a turn without making herself dizzy, following what the dancers do could wind up with a really nice concussion, but not much learning.Out of 10 videos in my bellydance library, this one is the absolute worst. I recommend anyone else's over this.

review/text: I think that The Haunting is a good scary movie(as opposed to movies like &quot;Scream&quot;). Instead of dealing with pyscho people running around in masks, it actually deals with the supernatural which is always fascinating. The movie was cast very well and the special effects are incredible. The ending however, twisted the movie into a theme of bliss, contentment, and nurturing. A good scary movie should leave you with a sense of &quot;what will happen next?&quot;. On the other hand, it would be hard to have a nightmare about it! All in all, it is a good movie that really screams the theme &quot;good vs evil&quot;.

review/text: Philbrick's book reads a lot like Sebastian Junger's &quot;The Perfect Storm.&quot; Like Junger, he details life in a fishing community and documents a seafaring trajedy that shook the town. Similar to Junger's description of drowning, Philbrick provides a graphic description of death by dehydration to emphasize what the fishermen were experiencing as they drifted for three months in open whaleboats on the vast Pacific Ocean. The main difference between Philbrick's account and Jungers is that some of Philbrick's fisherman lived to tell the tale. Philbrick is an excellent storyteller who brings his subject alive. Anyone with an interest in either the sea or a good adventure story will love this book.

review/text: I really can't say much more than has already been said about Helen Kane's performance style: it's definitely in the &quot;novelty&quot; category, but nonetheless consistently entertaining and even risque. Irrespective of the voice or the New Yawk accent, she's a darned good singer. The three short years she was famous have influenced listeners and performers for more than 72 years. What a pity that her career died so quickly!The documentation accompanying this CD is excellent, in that it covers her biography, the historical context of her career rise and fall, recording dates, and record matrices. Regarding the sound processing, let me say at the outset that I'm fundamentally opposed to stereoizing monophonic sources. Having said that, I can say that Robert Parker's stereo effects are fairly subtle, and certainly his denoising and equalization are generally quite good (occasionally I think the highs are rolled off a bit too much). The pseudo-stereo effect at its worst add a moderately annoying echo to Ms Kane's voice; the accompanying bands don't seem to suffer nearly so much from the processing. I wish that Parker had not done this; however, he could have done *far* worse.

review/text: I got this book shortly after returning from South America and at first glance I was impressed. The cover is decent, the publishing quality higher than expected, and the intro a good start. Unfortunately, the content is a disappointment. I have three main complaints about this volume, and some background will add perspective to these criticisms. I have been keeping and breeding poison frogs of the family Dendrobatidae for nearly a decade and am familiar with R.D. Bartlett as author of numerous articles for the pet trade. Rather than articles from the hobby, I prefer the scientific literature, journals or texts on various herpetological subjects. I have made nearly a dozen trips to the Neotropics with friends or family in the last 5 years and have seen both the dendrobatids I study as well as over a hundred species of frogs and dozens of species of lizards and snakes.My experiences in Central and South America have led me to conclude that ecotourist guides are ineffective. Whether they are for plants or animals, these guides are geared for people who are somewhat interested in a particular taxon, but relatively ignorant of the species. I have found that ecotourist guides illustrate a limited number of representative animals. This is justified in regions where there are hundreds of species including some new to science. However, the illustrations or descriptive text are so vague and generalized that they can't be used to identify species. The problem with ecotourist guides is that if you necessarily limit the number of species then you need more detail and information to make sure you are identifying the correct subject. However, most ecotourists want, at quick glance, to know what they saw and rarely require great detail. My first attempts to identify birds from an ecotourist guide were frustrating because of the lack of detail. I now travel with detailed excellent bird guides from various regions. I have been awaiting the herp equivalent of these books but the Bartletts' ecotourist's guide falls well short of the mark.The information offered is vague, downright silly, or wrong. For each animal there is a species account that includes size, identifying features, voice, reproduction, similar species, habitat/range, and comments. Size is a generalized descriptor but it frequently does not help in distinguishing between similar species. Identifying features usually state the obvious but after reading a number of these one gets the impression that an animal could not be identified based on what the Bartletts have written. Voice descriptions are useless. Frogs usually call in mixed species choruses so one would have to have a calling animal in front of them to ascertain what it sounded like. Many frogs quiet themselves upon human approach so it would take patience to catch a frog species calling. I don't believe the average `ecotourist' would make that effort. The calling description is also difficult to use. What is a "series of peeps", "two syllables often repeated", or "repeated buzzes"? The habitat/range info is equally useless. Take this quote from Platemys platycephala: "Although essentially aquatic, twist-necked turtles wander far overland during the rains and when water levels are high. They may be left high and dry as the waters recede." Does this mean one can find this turtle anywhere in the entire Amazon basin? Numerous ranges are listed as primary, secondary, or edge habitats or entire countries. Well of course! I guess it wouldn't be in the book if it didn't occur in the Amazon!Ah, but then that would be an incorrect assumption. Dendrobates azureus and D. tinctorius are poison frogs inhabiting the Guiana shield of South America. This geographically distinct region from the Amazon consists of a massive up welled landmass on the northern edge of South America. Take the following account of D. azureus. Voice: "Males produce easily overlooked peeps." The call of a male D. azureus is actually a soft buzz much like the electronic ballast of a fluorescent light fixture. Similar species: "Some dyeing poison frogs (D. tinctorius) are quite similar in color, but they usually sit in a more erect posture and often (but not always) have at least a little yellow on the back." Are the Bartletts suggesting that posture is an identifying characteristic of these species? They seem to think so, as they repeat that stance shortly thereafter under the account of D. tinctorius. Habitat/range: "This poison frog has become quite uncommon over much of its original range and is now found in isolated pockets of pinelands and surrounding rainforest near the Brazilian border in Southwestern Suriname. Of difficult access, this region is technically somewhat north of the actual delineation of the Amazon Basin but is drained by several rivers that do terminate in the Amazon." What exactly was the original range of this species? Difficult access to be sure. An expedition to collect this extremely rare species a few years ago was restricted as the local indigenous community controls the area. This region is not in the Amazon proper, but even more glaring is the Bartlett's stated reason for inclusion that the region has rivers that drain in the Amazon. Aside from the absurdity of that argument most of this region's rivers, the Sipaliwini included, flow north and drain into the Atlantic Ocean. So why are D. azureus and D. tinctorius included in this book? I can only conclude that they make pretty pictures, and like much of his dendrobatid section, are based on their popularity in the pet hobby.The entire dendrobatid section of this guide is filled with errors. The indigenous people of the Amazon did not use these frogs to "concoct a potent toxin from these compounds with which they coat darts and arrows." Only the Noanam&aacute; and Ember&aacute; Choc&oacute; Indians west of the Andes used frogs for poisoning darts. Most Amazonian hunting poisons are made from plants. The Bartletts frequently start to use locale as a defining characteristic for species but then lists the range as so wide, such as southeast Peru, that species overlap makes this technique useless. In fact they give no range for Dendrobates imitator and to beat that they include an incorrect photo of it. The Bartletts list the range of D. castaneoticus as Northeast Brazil (!), which is a massive area. Caldwell's description of the species specifies a much more restricted region. Under D. quinquevittatus they again say to use range to distinguish it from D. ventrimaculatus, yet the two species do have range overlap. They include an incorrect photo of D. quinquevittatus. They state that D. reticulatus are arboreal and while they are capable of climbing most hobbyists and field biologists know that they prefer a terrestrial lifestyle. Most of his accounts on Dendrobatids seem based on their, or others', hobby/pet trade experience. Many of the poison frog photos are of captive specimens. I wonder why they relied on these instead of in-situ shots of these animals if they were as widely traveled as they claim.The Bartletts' vague mentality carries on in nearly every aspect of this book. Take the species account of Hyla leali. Bartlett calls it a non-descript frog that can most reliably be identified by what it is not (?!). There are hundreds of species of hylid frogs in the region. His photo of it is a Hyla brevifrons. Writing of vipers, they state that captive Bothriopsis bilineata can kill a lab mouse quickly. They remark repeatedly that nocturnal vipers are more prone to bite after dark. Obviously these comments are fluff and seem to be just words to fill the spaces; perfectly meaningless for identification or natural history.The errors go on. I thought of listing them but there are simply too many to include here. Not to mention that I'm not being paid to correct the Bartletts' mistakes.My last critique is of the photos. They are generally good and usually catch the identifying characteristics of the frogs, but the print quality is poor. It seems as if someone went bonkers with the hue/saturation settings in Photoshop, as many of the bright colors come off as garish and inaccurate. Some appear as if printed with a color laser printer. Nonetheless, the photos are the only useful part of this book. In fact this book would be more useful if it were just a collection of photos with species captions. That could certainly limit the number of inaccuracies.The authors present themselves as Amazonian experts but after reading through this work it seems they just made a number of trips to the Iquitos region, taken a bunch of photos of the region's herps (as indicated by the location captions), and decided to publish a book. I would guess that many of the animals were identified for them; otherwise some research would have produced a deeper knowledge. The topic seems broader than their experience and their facts and natural history information come off as made up or based on limited dealings with the animals. They certainly could have benefited from delving into the literature on ranges, natural history, and other details that scientists have been documenting for years.If you have herp experience or are serious about these animals then I can't recommend this book. It is inferior to Rodriguez and Duellman's, Guide to the Frogs of the Iquitos Region, Amazonian Peru, and Dixon and Soini's guide to the Reptiles of the Iquitos region. This book does have more photos, some of which prove useful in identifying animals. But if you were to take the Bartletts' advice and travel to the region with any of the South America tour companies, many with herp experts, then those experts will likely identify the animals for you free of charge.

review/text: I had to laugh at the editorial review, which accuses Dr. Jacobsen of being "elitist," one of the many criticisms that gifted people receive. Maybe that reviewer should have read the book more carefully. This is a terrific book that will help people realize their potential. That's a good thing for the world and should not be discouraged or belittled.If you have struggled with fitting in only to feel like you cannot be your authentic self, this book will help you discover why. I also recommend "Dark Side of the Light Chasers" and other books by Debbie Ford to help you discover the damage done by all those messages to play small, and begin to heal, giving yourself permission to be BIG.

review/text: This album was not death metal or even thrash metal by today's standards. It was, however, an incredible debut that I ended up owning on cassette, album form, and finally, CD. Unfortunately, Nasty Savage sounded best when they werent trying to be heavy. Some bands do (Metallica, Possessed come to mind immediately), just check out the incredible original version of XXX (available on Metal Massacre 6) and then listen to the much faster, more aggressive, and much less interesting version on the CD 'Indulgence' and see what I mean.)This album is actually very good "idontknowwhatyouwouldcategorizethisstuffas" metal for this time period. For some reason, they decided to use more death metal growls and faster beats on future records and that made them sound like they were trying to do too much....This album is their crowning glory.

review/text: I first heard M.I.A. in a recreation hall on my University's campus on a mixer with a great sound system (filled the entire downstairs and upstairs with sweet vibes). I agree with most of the points on other positive reviews: this has great beats, lyrics, vocals, and the likes.There is one thing you should keep in mind before buying or judging this album: it almost REQUIRES a good sound system because the music feeds off the bass. Like many "dance" genres, bass is a heavy component in making the tracks work, and this is no exception. The vocal are great, but have difficulty standing alone without heavy bass. Thus, if you're like me with two simple speakers and a default sound card, you might want to reconsider buying the album or risk slight disappointment.For me, it was a very upsetting difference, because I know what the songs COULD be. I would recommend high quality speakers/sound card and a woofer, or else you're missing out--big time.

review/text: "Cruel and Unusual" was my first Scarpetta book, and when I looked on the jacket of "From Potter's Field" and saw that it would deal with Temple Gault again, I decided to read it next, hoping to see this killer get what he deserves.Most of this book was pretty engrossing, even though I did have some gripes. Kay's affair with Benton is disappointing to me since she seems to pride herself on "doing the right thing." Lucy was insufferable in this one. She was younger in "Cruel and Unusual" and I could overlook her idiosyncracies, but she's older now and needs to get a grip - she almost seems to resent or dislike Kay at times but then turns around and loves her again. Also, Lucy's genius IQ and role as an FBI computer program writer who busts crime with her keyboard are beyond corny.The best part IMO was the scene in the morgue, as others have said. I don't think I would have been able to put the book down if a tornado had ripped through my house while I was reading that part!It is difficult to believe that a crazy guy high on cocaine most of the time could always be one step ahead of the police and FBI, brutally murdering people right under their noses and getting away with it.But then the worst came. The ending. Wham, bam, it's over, with Temple Gault's fate implied but none of the juicy details I was hungering for. There wasn't even a page break - one second we're in the subway tunnels of New York, the next we're flying over Potter's Field. Huh?

If you're interested in EXACTLY how to make the perfect pie crust or puff pastry, this is for you. If you find analyses of Heckers flour vs King Arthur mind-numbing, you might want to pass it up and go back to the baking chapter of The Joy of Cooking.Although it's geared towards the more serious baker, it's useful for novices too, as the instructions are very detailed and she goes to great lengths to explain why she does everything she does (this is good for bakers of all abilities, because some of her techniques are nontraditional).Many of the recipes are time consuming, but they are worth it--gorgeous to look at and delicious to taste.

review/text: After his hugely successful debut quartet (Revelation Space, Chasm City, Redemption Ark, and Absolution Gap) Alastair Reynolds has begun widening his range. Century Rain and his latest, Pushing Ice, are set in different universes from each other, and from the shared universe of the first four books. And whereas Century Rain takes place at a time intermediate between the present and that of Revelation Space, Pushing Ice starts in the near future - 2057, to be precise. As to where it ends... well, that would be telling.The action begins when Janus, one of Saturn's moons, mysteriously leaves orbit and accelerates towards the edge of the Solar System. The only vehicle in position to intercept its path is the nuclear-powered mining ship Rockhopper, with its crew of 145 captained by Bella Lind. At the request of Deepshaft, the owners, Bella asks the crew if they are willing to take the unknowable risks involved. Swayed by the promise of huge bonuses, a majority votes to go for it, and the chase is on. But instead of three days of high acceleration, a week of observation, and laughing all the way home to the bank, they soon find themselves fighting for their lives.It would be wrong to give away any more of the plot, as its effectiveness rests largely on a series of surprises that go on right to the end of the book. Suffice it to say that, while slowly but steadily building up the tension and introducing us to a wide cast of characters, Reynolds weaves in some fascinating technical ideas - from an effective method of freezing dying people for future resuscitation to the potential implications of femtotech (a step beyond nanotech) and relativistic time compression. Watch out, too, for some mind-boggling aliens: in 45 years of reading SF, I have never come across anything quite like the Musk Dogs or the Fountainheads.Other reviewers seem to have been disappointed at the obvious differences between Pushing Ice and Reynolds' first four books. It seems to me that these are the inevitable consequences of his decision to tackle a near-future scenario, along with slightly greater emphasis on characterisation and social relationships. The people of Absolution Gap, for example, are so alien to us - what with their nanotech implants and exotic lifestyles - that it is difficult to empathise with them. Hard SF writers are always being criticised for neglecting the "wetware element", but often their attempts to introduce it backfire badly. Reynolds does pretty well, I think: his people are believable, well differentiated, and easy to like or dislike. All in all, I still think he is the best SF writer active today, and this book is a worthy successor to his previous work. It certainly isn't Jane Austen, and it won't suit readers who want a brisk, action-packed, 200-page novel; but it is ideal for those of us who love to get stuck into a long, detailed SF saga.

review/text: Forget all the mystique and technical commentary about Coltrane -- this is an experience for every listener. You do not need to be a 'jazz expert' (whatever that means) or consumed by religion to appreciate this. 'A Love Supreme' is one of the most accessible, powerful works of popular music in existence. It transcends the genre -- read the reviews, there are plenty of listeners for whom this was their first or second jazz album. If you are new to Coltrane or to jazz, you won't go wrong by starting here.I once read, in a comparison between Coltrane and Stan Getz -- another outstanding tenor sax -- that while you admired Getz' incredible technique or the way he interpreted a particular passage, with Coltrane you were taken by the immensity of the experience. 'A Love Supreme' is exactly that -- a wave of sound, from Coltrane's incomparable saxophone to McCoy Tyner's piano, Garrison's bass and Elvin Jones unforgettable percussion. If you're looking for background music or easy listening, look elsewhere. For 35 minutes of some of the most powerful music of the past century, five stars isn't enough.

review/text: Most of what author Kevin Phillips talks about in American Theocracy seems absolutely true. The "end of oil," the huge personal, corporate, and government debt, and political ties too close to religion seem like impossible burdens for the US to bear. However, the book is so overloaded with statistics about who voted for whom in what counties for the last 150 years, the percentage rises and declines of various religious denominations, and esoteric economic theory that it will be rendered unreadable to most anyone who does manage to slog through it.On the face, it seems we're going to get an analysis of the perils of too much religious influence in politics in general in a title like "American Theocracy." But what we find is that Phillips has a particular disdain for evangelical Christians and the Southern Baptist Convention. Most of the rants directed toward that denomination are primarily directed at the denomination's role in electing both Presidents Bush. He gives historical nods to the fact that yes, both President Clinton and President Carter are Southern Baptists as is former VP Gore, but he only seems to be concerned now that Southern Baptists elected republicans, not when they rallied behind democrats.Phillips also has a condescending habit of categorizing religious denominations he seems to have little respect for. Reading his grouping of denominations into "sects" (to me "sect" carries very negative connotations the way it is primarily used in the world ) you'll basically come to find that if you don't belong to a mainline Protestant denomination (I think he names 5 -Presbyterians, original Lutherans, Methodists, Episcopalian, and Church of Christ) you belong to a "sect." Yes, Southern Baptists, Missouri Synod Lutherans, any variety of Pentecostal (another group he shows repeated disdain for apparently due to a bitter dislike for John Ashcroft), Church of the Nazarene, any "non-denominational" mega-church, or any of dozens of other denominations, he has determined you belong to a "sect." And if you are a Mormon he has determined that your religion qualifies as a "cult."It's unfortunate that he has decided to make this book one-sided in its attacks on the Bush family, republicans, and Southern Baptists. He cites, for example, the improper use of the church pulpit as a platform to promote specific political agendas or politicians as if the republicans/right wing invented it. In doing so, he's guilty of a huge double-standard by completely failing to mention the democrats' mingling of religion and politics in a stronger sense with the Rev. Jesse Jackson (who gets of one sentence mention in the whole book) and he also completely misses the highly televised clearly pandering church appearances Pres. Clinton was prone to making around elections and policy times in churches where it seemed unlikely he'd ever attend without TV cameras in tow.Another double-standard is that the whole book centers around what he sees as unwillingness of the republican party to alienate conservative Christians (who he feels are the most radical 20-30% of the electorate). (See page 348 for a summation of "blind constituency commitments" and "stagnant but entrenched politics.") But he never mentions the democrats' unwillingness to question their ties to the radical feminist elements within NOW, unions, and other left-leaning special interest groups. He misses the point that if either side were to make the radical leap of not pandering to the extreme bases, they might capture a huge majority in the middle. As far as I could tell, he makes only one nod to the democrats' blunder in this regard, on page 237 when he acknowledged that the 60s and 70s attempted by secular liberals to push all hints of religion out of public life were the first shot fired in the culture war and were what has caused such a tremendous backlash from the right. He saves until a couple of sentences in the afterword any exposing of his double-standard on the Bush dynasty when he finally owns up that the dems have enjoyed a Kennedy dynasty as well and look to be banking on a Clinton Dynasty.Despite his overwhelming use of statistics from voting results and surveys, he makes assumptions and guesses lacking data to back them up. I can't to count the number of times he cites sales and readership of the "Left Behind" book series as evidence that x% of the population probably thinks or votes this way or that. At one point he cites anonymous internet chat room economists as a source of trepidation. While his points might be valid, for such a heavily researched book with 30 pages of end-notes, such assumptions and lack of valid sources in places are major short comings.He also makes thinly veiled attempts to tie evangelical or fundamental religious beliefs to poor education, mental health, child poverty, and homicide (page 203). He almost seems nostalgic for McCarthyism when on page 245 he notes the similarities between the current efforts to expose radical right "reconstructionism" and the successful outings of communists. All part of a very elitist attitude that permeates his writing.What I did find fascinating about the book though (when he wasn't burying me in needless statistics - he needed an editor to talk some sense into him in this regard especially in chapters 5 and 6) was his ability to relate out current energy crises, looming financial crisis, and political dependence on religion to other world powers who have come and gone down the same road: the Dutch, Spanish, and British empires. He makes a strong case that the parallels in those societies to that in the 21st century US are too great to ignore. I consider myself above average in reading habits and education but much of what he presented to me went into the "wow, I didn't learn that bit of history in school." For that reason alone, I do recommend reading this book, but I'd also recommend skipping and skimming some, and being honest about your own leanings when he's criticizing someone else.

review/text: Originally written by Mildred Wirt Benson from outlines by Edward Stratemeyer, the Nancy Drew series was first published in 1930s. THE SECRET OF RED GATE FARM was the sixth book in the series, and like the earlier books it presented its heroine as a rich, headstrong, and distinctly reckless teenager who sometimes carried a pistol and who wasn't above breaking the law when it suited her purposes.As the series progressed and other writers began to generate Nancy Drew novels, the character changed and Nancy was "toned down;" instead of flatly rich, she became reasonably affluent; recklessness was replaced by commonsense caution; and while she might be willing to bend the law a bit she would never knowingly break it. In the 1950s and 1960s the earlier novels were re-written to reflect this change in character.Originally published in 1931, RED GATE FARM was re-written in 1961--but unlike several other re-written titles the story remains much the same. In this instance, Nancy and her friends Bess and George visit Red Gate Farm, where owner Mrs. Byrd is in financial difficulty and has rented a portion of the land to a religious cult. When Nancy becomes curious, she and her friends are threatened by the cult members--and they decide to infiltrate the group's strange gatherings.It is worth noting that the cult, which is called The Black Snake Cult, dresses in white robes with odd, peaked hoods, and Nancy and the girls consider disguising themselves with sheets and pillowcases the better to spy upon their activities. Given the era of the book's first publication and later re-write, this would seem to be a subconcious reference to the Klu Klux Klan on the author's part! As always in the original series, the story is very much of its era: there are no cell phones, computers, or modern gadgets, and Nancy is very much an ideal of the time: she can sew, herd a cow, treat a snakebite, and still seem to dress appropriately for all social occasions.The Nancy Drew books are not great literature by any stretch of the imagination--they are too distinctly formula for that--but they are competently written, literate, and never talk down to their target audience. They are also good "comfort reading" for grown-ups who recall their childhood reading fondly. RED GATE FARM is an amusing read for old fans and newcomers alike.GFT, Amazon Reviewer

review/text: I never really write reviews, but after using this product I felt a strong need to do so. I had been researching hoodia for a little while, and decided that I would try this product since it was inexpensive and had free shipping. I have lost weight using this, combined with exercise and a large cutback in caloric intake, but have some issues with this product. Since I have researched more, I have found that hoodia is very expensive, so it seems unlikely that this company would strengthen the concentration of hoodia 20:1 and sell it for ten dollars a box. Most other reputable hoodia brands cost around $50 for a nondiluted 100% hoodia stock, so I have doubts about whether this product contains any hoodia at all. However, this does contain A LOT of caffeine. I typically only drink 1 cup of tea during the day, and found that taking these pills do make me jittery and keep me up at night. Even sleeping pills have not helped me to fall asleep. The box also suggests that if you would like to increase the amount of weight lost, you can take double the amount instructed. I have also tried this, and found that I act as though I am totally high. I am off the wall, feel disconnected, and cannot come down for many hours. This combination of single and double doses (I have stopped taking the double) have caused me to lose sleep almost the entire time that I have been taking it. The box instructs you not to take these pills in the evening if you cannot sleep after taking caffeine, but I can drink coffee right before bed and not have an issue. These pills are a different story. The lastest that I have been taking these pills is 1pm and still not been able to sleep at 10. I know that this is long, but I wanted other people who may be interested in trying this, to know about my experiences before they spend their money. Since ordering this pack of three, I have done a lot more investigating and have actually purchased a different brand of 100% south african hoodia that comes with all of the required paperwork for the legit pills. By the way, this product does not include the required c.i.t.e.s. and other documentation stating that it actually comes from south africa, or that it has been tested by an independent lab confirming its contents.In conclusion, I have lost weight with this product, but I think that it may be due to the amount of stimulants, and not the hoodia that I don't believe is included.

review/text: It is difficult to properly review this book. If one is used to the superb works usually presented by Taunton Press, Setting Up Shop is a disappointment. Not because the information is inadequate; far from it! Sandor presents solutions to problems you wouldn't have thought existed until they jumped up and bit you on the nose. How much insulation should you have in your new shop? How do you keep the cords from wrapping around your legs and dropping you into the whirring tablesaw blade? Did you even know it could happen? It can. Sandor Nagyszalanczy will help you avoid disaster.Unfortunately, I cannot give a full five stars to this book because it's layout is, basically, odd. References to other pages in the book are wrong and you have to hunt before and after to find the chart, reference, picture, etc. you wanted. The text seems to disappear around a photo and reappear on the next page where you wouldn't expect it. Very, very annoying!Still, I learned an enormous amount and so will you. There is golden data hidden here but it is well worth the search.

review/text: I read the other reviews of this item, and I'm totally lost. I had this on original vinyl and absolutely LOVED it, and some of the tracks mentioned in the first review did NOT exist on the original LP, which was correctly issued in 1974. I consider this LP to be one of the best the Hollies ever did, as it showcased the musical style they developed far better than most of their previous work, which sometimes included covers of other persons' material. True, it's not the stuff one may expect, if they consistantly think of the Hollies as doing only songs like Stop, Stop, Stop, or Carrie Anne, but I doubt anyone could honestly say this LP/CD is not one of their best.

review/text: The story we all know: for some unexplained reason the dead are waking and preying on the living. One reason offered is that there is no room left in Hell. Other reasons are viruses or some kind of sickness. Regardless of the reason, this version updates what was a terrific-for-its-time cult classic and indeed makes it better.If you are a preservationist and don't appreciate your classics being tampered with, then just stay away. But if you like a good horror flick that is suspenseful, scary and very very well acted, then add this to your collection. It's just modernized, and in my opinion, made a bit more realistic. The story follows the original version almost line by line (so I can't figure out what all the fuss by the preservationists is about).The "Night" that "it" all started we find several random folks caught in the middle of the chaos looking for refuge in a remote countryside farmhouse. Terror ensues. The confused group battles over how to get out of the situation before the zombies get in. I was especially fond of how ultimately the infamous Barbara (you know..."they're coming to get you, Barbara") introduces Mr. Cooper to fate in this version.As I said, scary, suspenseful and well acted.

I have to say that now that I have finished both books and compared the two,they are written a little differently. I enjoyed both books immensly. Dawn on a Different Shore is packed full of adventure and detail however there isn't the slow pace detail in the story to savor like Into the Wilderness had. I too look forward to another book from Sara Donati that will let us enjoy Hidden Wolf and the wonderful characters and setting she has created for us there.

But when, oh when, is Clark Kent going to learn to fly and BE Superman? I for one am getting tired waiting.Tom Welling, who plays Clark Kent, is 33 years old! If we don't have a superman by the end of the 10th series we never will. I fear the program makers are worried that once he becomes Superman the story is complete, and they're out of work. But there is no reaon that should be. A proper Superman series would make the ultimate spin-off.

review/text: OK, this stuff works great because it's very strong. I had a wart on my hands that was there for YEARS and not it's gone. I even had my doctor freeze it twice and it still didn't go away. This stuff got rid of it in about 15 days.HERE'S THE TIP:The key is to isolate the wart so the medication doesn't affect the good skin. This is especially important for small warts.Tip #1: Take a large plastic bandage (not fabric), and cut off the two sticky sides and throw away the padded portion in the middle. Take one of the sticky sides (save the other one for later) and with the backing still on it and fold it into four (half and half again). Now cut the center corner off to make a small hole in the middle - you want the hole just a tiny bit bigger than the wart. Then unfold it, take the backing off, and apply it on your wart with the wart sticking out of the hole. Now you can apply a big glob of the Wart Stick medication and you wont have to worry about it killing the surrounding good skin. Apply an second full bandage on top of the medication and you're good to go.Tip #2: Make sure you apply the medication after a shower when the skin is soft and more penetrable.Tip#3: If you have a stubborn wart, do it in intervals. Apply the medication for 2-3 days, then leave it uncovered and unmedicated for a day or two so it can harden and peel off. Then repeat. My stubborn wart took three rounds but with some patience, it did finally go away.

review/text: Firstly, let me say that I am not an expert in Latin, though I am certaintly able to read it, understand it, and also know a little about its literary techniques. One of the most grating errors I have found in this translation is the continual rhyming of its lines. Latin, being a language of often mutable word ending but even more amorphous word order, had no need to rhyme its verse, and therefore any translation, in English, that insists on rhyming for any purpose usually obfuscates the original meaning so much that it is, in of itself, a whole different poem.I have also seen the ommission of many names in the work, which I find unappealing. While I do enjoy that it is able to combine the original latin with the english translation, I would recommend searching for a similar book with a better translator: it will make the epigrams far more enjoyable.

Instead of "big stars," it has great actors, chief among them being Christian Bale as Batman.Whereas Tim Burton's films seemed obsessed with the way the films looked, Nolan cares more about plot, script, performances, and other concepts long since abandoned by Hollywood.Comparisons to Joel Schumacher's Batman films aren't necessary, as they were horrible.Go see this film. It's easily the best film of the year. Period.

I sure would watch it again, even if it wasn't mandatory! It's an instant classic, and a must have for anyone. You wil love this movie. My parents love it too, it brings back a lot of memories for them (yes, good ones). All age groups would like this, except maybe ones younger than my age group (mid-teens).

review/text: In Understanding August Wilson Professor Bogumil covers six of his plays: Ma Rainey's Black Bottom, Fences, Joe Turner's Come and Gone, The Piano Lesson, Two Trains Running, and Seven Guitars. The book opens with a chapter on August Wilson as an African American playwrite that talks about his life as well as what sets his plays apart from thos of other African American playwrites. Professor Bogumil ties in Wilson's plays to societal facotrs, and has crafted a very fine and scholarly work that makes August Wilson's writing more approachable and understandable to anyone from students to casual readers.

review/text: I was surprised that my theater actually got this movie today. It doesn't seem to be getting much play around the country and will likely hit DVD before most people can witness this strange little gem. I read some really positive reviews from critics and movie watchers alike, so I figured I would give it a shot. I haven't been a fan of Nicolas Cage for a long time, mainly because he seems to be taking every bad movie and turning in a subpar performance. Now that we know he has money problems in real life, it at least makes sense now. I'm happy to say the he is back in top form here. His character is as bad as Denzel Washington's in Training Day and he is played in the same over the top way, without seeming to be unbelievable. He has a hunched back and carries his .44 magnum in the front of his pants wherever he goes. Most of the characters in Bad Lieutenant are predictable scum, but Cage throws so much into this performance that you really have no clue what's going to happen from one scene to the next. He is at his crazy best here and reminded me that few people can play weird as well as this man. Eva Mendes is looking pretty good here and her acting is decent, but her role doesn't amount to much other than a slight bright spot for Cage's loose cannon. Val Kilmer shows up and is quite good, but he is barely in the movie. Maybe five minutes tops.On the negative side, this film is very dark and often mean, but thankfully some humor forces it's way through in some of these scenes. There are also some bizarre visuals, such as a point of view shot from an alligator and another from a couple of iguanas for no reason at all. A few scenes also linger on a bit to long and the pacing slows at times, but I was sucked into this corrupt man's life and couldn't keep my eyes off the screen. Welcome back Mr. Nicolas Cage of old and don't go anywhere this time around.

There was something special about his voice and music that reminds me of songs that I grew up with (Elvis, Eagles, Chicago).

review/text: This was Gardner's first book. Like a lot of first books, it has some good ideas, some bad ideas and some mediocre execution.The Technocracy is a good idea. A galaxy wide, fairly informal organization, it encompasses civilizations so advanced as to be omnipotent. Earth is a very junior member. There's only one unalterable rule in the Technocracy: non-sentient species, defined as a species that kills, aren't permitted to travel beyond their system. If they try, they are killed, with no more compunction than we'd swat a mosquito.Explorers are a good idea, they are brave, intelligent scouts on new planets, with physical defects that make their inescapably high mortality rates politically acceptable. I'm not sure I buy the premise, but at least it's a new idea.Melaquin, the &quot;dumping ground&quot; for the Earth's political hot potatoes, is a bad idea, and the corruptness, incompetence and stupidity of the Earth's governing body is a genuinely dumb idea.Still, the good carries the bad, and overall this is a good read. Gardner's later books, featuring much the same cast of characters, are better. Festina Ramos, the protagonist here, is a far more interesting person in &quot;Vigilant&quot; and &quot;Hunted,&quot; two of the later books.Gardner bears watching. If he continues to improve, he could be a genuinely new voice in science fiction.

When her grandfather suddenly dies, Kit decides to live with her only living relatives in Connecticut. She has a rocky start on the boat trip over. On the Dolphin, she meets a boy named Nat Eaton, the captain's son, a young girl named Prudence Cruff, whose mother abuses her and accuses Kit of being a witch, and a man named John Holbrook, who is going to Wethersfield to be a student of the minister. It all started when Prudence's doll fell overboard and Kit jumps in to get it. In Connecticut, if you float on water, you are considered a witch. She is an outcast from the moment she gets off the ship. With her beautiful gowns and wild manner, she doesn't fit in with her Connecticut, Puritan family. She lives with her Uncle Matthew, her Aunt Rachel, and her two cousins, Mercy, and Judith. Uncle Matthew doesn't welcome Kit at all. He is upset that she didn't write him a letter first, but she didn't tell him that she didn't write because she had to leave right away or else she would have to marry an old man. Everyone at the &quot;Meeting&quot; or church, is shocked of her lovely clothes, and her personality. William Ashby, a boy Kit's age starts to court her, but Judith likes him. Everyone knows that William won't build his own house until he knows who he wants to marry, and everyone knows that he is about to propose to Kit. Everyone, including Judith, thinks John Holbrook is going to propose to Judith, but he really is in love with Mercy and she is in love with him. Kit feels bad about not being able to help the family much, and is very happy when she gets an oppertunity to make wages and teaching school with Mercy. Kit decides to teach the children by putting on a play about a story in the bible. It gets out of hand and Mr. Kimberley, the school master gets very upset and dismisses or &quot;fires&quot; Kit. She runs to the Meadow and there, she meets a Widow Tupper, who everyone believes to be a witch. She secretly becomes good friends with Widow Tupper, and the Widow helps her get her job back in the school, and secretly teaches Prudence how to read. Then a plague sweeps through the town and Kit is accused of doing it! Mercy is close to dying and Judith is also very sick. Kit has to save Hannah Tupper before its too late! When Kit is put on trial she finds her true friends. This story is very romantic, and very exciting. It shows how people care for each other and help each other no matter what. I think this is a wonderful book for all ages, and I hope everyone enjoys it as much as it did.

review/text: Patty Bergen lives in Jenkinsville, Arkansas, a little town with a big future. She is Jewish and lives in the time of World War Two. She is constantly insulted and hurt by her unloving parents. At this time her town because a site for a camp that holds German prisoners from the war. Patty meets one of the prisoner boys named Anton and risks her life in hiding him in her own house so that he can escape back to his family in Germany. While hiding him she befriends him more and more everyday and sees the kind-hearted wise, loving man that Anton is, rather than just a "Nazi" like the rest of the world thinks. She realizes that he is the only one in the whole world who truly loves her, that would give his life to save her, as he takes the chance of coming out of hiding to save Patty from being terribly beaten by her father. The author does a good job of showing the closeness that comes between Patty and Anton and the love that they feel for each other regardless of background, family, or what side of the war they are on. I do wish that the author added more events to the story that make the reader even more attached to the characters and their love to each other. The outcome of the story is truly real feeling and has an absolutely stunning end.

review/text: When one starts reading a Victorian novelist, one prepares before hand to face a certain amount of wooden, heavy-handed moralizing, as every great narrative of the epoch is fraught with the opposition between the calls of pleasure and the calls of duty, between seeking for one's private advantage and sticking to one's role, with the writer making the latter to win overwhelming. This novel is no different, in that it's the dutiful Romola that has the upper hand over her nice and debauched husband Tito Melena in the end. However, the novel being set in late Renaissance Italy- a country with which George Eliot had an enduring love affair - it captures the atmosphere of the time and place in such a beautiful way that this enormous, throughly reserched historical novel has such a flowing, luxurious style that takes an almost liquid quality, like a fresh, transparent scream flowing along a summer Mediterranean landscape. Also, in the person of Savonarola, Eliot menaged to introduce the figure of the idealist turned evil through his attachment to his call. In short: a gorgeous novel. Loved it!

If you love Fantasy,dragons,and rapunzel you should get the movie-and this very fun game!(The movie is very nice,even though it is 4 years old!)And another thing-Barbie's mask is not a mask-it is just a feather in the air-have you seen it? PS Please vote on my review! 'BARBIE LOVER'

review/text: I remember having read this book in high school. I immediately fell in love with Hardy. (I was also fond of Hardy Boys at that time, so in my opinion the name Hardy acquired a special significance.) Unfortunately, though, I never liked another book by him quite so much. I've read Tess of the d'Urbvilles, Under the Greenwood Tree, Far from the Madding Crowd(which was perhaps his second best novel, as others here have affirmed), and perhaps a few others. It is strange, or perhaps significant that I remember the exact circumstance when I was reading this book. It must have been about ten in the night. I had cleared my study desk, and unlike my common practice of lying on my stomach on my bed to enjoy a book into the night, I sat down on the straight-backed chair at the desk to read it. Very soon, I was overwhelmed by the narrative of Mr. Hardy. My father came in to see what I was up to, saw the tears streaming down my face as I turned the pages of my book, and quietly went away. I have never before owned any story books- my parents told me to read out of libraries. But now I am 22, and have started earning some money of my own, and I'm going to start a little collection of my most beloved books, to pass on to my children, perhaps? And this is among my very best.

review/text: One of the first albums I ever bought was Abraxas, way back around '71. I loved Carlos's fiery guitar playing and aggressive, percussive rythms, and bought all subsequent Santana releases until the early 80s. At that point I felt Santana became too "pop" oriented and I lost interest. I guess I can't blame Carlos for his more recent incorporation of world and hip hop in his music, if you want to sell records and survive as a musician, you have to give the people what they want, and virtuoso lead guitar doesn't sell like it did 30 plus years ago.When I saw that the new "Live by Request" DVD included older songs like Soul Sacrifice and Evil Ways and my all time Santana favorite "Europa" I decided I had to check it out.To my surprise Carlos plays extremely well, and the old songs have lost very little over the years. One of the newer pieces (DA LE) Yaleo includes some nice jazz/rock fusion, sounding a little bit like music from the Lotus release way back when. Carlos is wearing a John Coltrane "Love Supreme" T shirt, which seems to set the tone for some fine playing and indicates that, despite surrounding himself with a lot of new "pop" stars, he hasn't forgotten his roots and inspiration. When the hip hoppers jump on stage, I simply jump to the next track. All in all, a very enjoyable DVD for an old Santana fan like me. The camera work and sound are very good, but I rate the DVD 4 stars because the set is only about an hour long.

review/text: Clifton Webb is perfectly cast as the British Naval Officer who devises the plan to decieve German Intelligence, as to the whereabouts of the Allied landings in Sicily during World War 2. As with most British films of its kind, &quot;The Man Who Never Was&quot; relies upon the facts to maintain interest throughout,tampering with history just enough to provide tension and drama where it is needed. Webb's performance is both intelligent and touching, while Stephen Boyd as the German agent sent to investigate the situation,exudes just the right amount of charm and malevolence. Gloria Graham is probably the only downside to this highly effective film,but the others well and truly make up for her somewhat overcooked effort. Made in 1956, in colour, &quot;The Man Who Never Was&quot; has not &quot;dated&quot; at all and stands as a fine example of the British cinema's ability to tell a good story well.

review/text: Lincoln Reconsidered is a collection of provactive essays that probe the multiple depths of Abraham Lincoln--life and mythology. He paints Lincoln's portrait onto the background of the sectional conflict that led to the Civil War. Originally published about 1961, Donald's stories remain fresh and relevant. In fact the reader will encounter the thesis and outline for his recent prize-winning biography of Lincoln. I first encoutered LR in 1962 when I taught Advanced Placement American History and assigned portions of the book to my students. They loved it; you will. Donald is a superlative historian and stylist. Listen to these chapter headings: Getting Right With Lincoln, Reconsideration of Abolitionists, Herndon and Mrs. Lincoln, Folklore Lincoln, An Excess of Democracy. Readers of Donald's Lincoln will want to have this as a companion reference piece. It's rare for an historian's essays to experience such a rich and extended publishing history. Here's a quote from my faded copy of LR, a touch of wisdom for our parlous times: &quot;...Lincoln knew that there were limits rational human activity, and that there was no virtue in irritably seeking to perform the impossible. As President, he could only do his best to handle problems as they arose and have a patient trusdt that popular support for his solutions would be forthcoming. But the ultimate decision was beyond his, or any man's, control. 'Now at the end of three years struggle,' he said, 'the nation's condition is not what either party, or any man, devised, or expected. God alone can claim it.'&quot; Page after page runs like this, and virtually every theme connected to the Civil War gets enough discussion to stimulate and edify.

review/text: I seen this film with high expectations, I've seen all the Batman films, and I liked them all, well, Batman and Robin was...sub-par. Batman and Batman Returns were well done, and Batman Begins could easily compare. Christian Bale is a magnificent actor, after I seen him in "Reign of Fire" and "American Psycho". He did have a little problem with his Batman voice, it was a little too raspy and tough-guyish, but other than that, he was a frightening hero who saved Gotham from a deadly gas.The film has a large and effective cast. Micheal Caine, a great choice for Alfred, brings laughs and a warm heart. Morgan Freeman plays Batman's gagdets man Lucius Fox, who has only a small role, but still great. Katie Holmes plays Rachel Dodson, Batman's close friend and heart's interest. She's pretty good, compared to Kim Basinger and Nicole Kidman. Gary Oldman plays Gordon, Batman's friendly police officer, and does a good job at it too. The Commisioner Gordon in the later Batman films is Pat Hingle, and he wasn't that good. Liam Neeson is awesome as Henri Ducard, Batman's former trainer turned villain. Cillian Murphy played the horrific Scarecrow, but onlyhad a small role, which was dissapointing because it was such an awesome character, and he didn't appear to be defeated, he was electricuted by Rachel and then he was gone from the rest of the film. Too bad.The action was great, great car chase scene, and explosions and things crashing and smashing, and the fighting was good too, except the camera was awkward during fights, making the view close up and weird to distinguish between whats going on and who's getting hurt.Something that bothered me was how it interacted with the first Batman film. In Batman, Jack (the Joker) kills Bruce's parents. But in this, some thug who's name I didn't catch (but it wasn't Jack) kills his parents. And at the end of Batman Begins, Gordon hands Batman a Joker card telling him this is his next villian, but in Batman, Jack doesn't turn into the Joker until later in the film.Overall, an awesome and well-done and well-casted movie!

review/text: These work. Very well. But I worry that I won't be able to commit to spending 5 minutes on this every day. It's a couple minutes to apply step one, then a couple minutes to wait, then a couple minutes to apply step two, then wait a bit. Then the next step cannot apply alcohol or rinsing. So this needs to happen when you have the time and no plans to apply an alcohol product immediately afterward. So for me it seems like the best time to apply is an hour before bedtime. Then just before bedtime I can apply eye and night cream.This product is good for someone who has some fine lines and perhaps occasional surface acne. It is not for someone with sensitive skin. Please note that you will need to use skincare that provides more moisture while you employ this regimen because the exfoliation will cause temporary dryness.

review/text: I will not spend a lot of time in detail here, but I have always loved this story although the ending is hearth wrenching. That just goes to show you how real it is, realistic, dramatic and gripping tale set in an America that was not so long ago. If you are a younger person wanting to expand the fictional horizons of your library this would be a good book to start with. I first saw the TV movie of it when I was in Junior High and never forgot it. Years later I bought this Centennial Edition and now have probably read it four times. It is just one of those stories that has so much power with the power of love, but also carries a world of pain. Don't read my review any more just go read this novel if you have not already!

review/text: I first saw this film in a college cinema class. After we watched it, a long discussion ensued, led largely by the feminist-minded females (and males, for that matter), about the number of scenes where Brando was shirtless vs. the number of times Maria Schneider was (mercifully, Brandon kept his Haines on at all times). We talked about how this is a "male-eyed" film, about how Schneider's character is never as fully developed, etc., etc. (Frankly, I think a character who can utter the lines "You treat me like a woahr," is pretty well-developed.)Almost 20 years later, I realize there's no way a class of 20-somethings could have appreciated what we were seeing, and thus the true greatness of the film eluded young, high-minded college students more interested in Maria's nipples than in Brando's angst. For not once did any of us talk about the shattering scene where Brando confronts his dead wife. If there's anything from Last Tango In Paris I took with me, it's that, and the amazing acting therein. I really don't care about Schneider's boobs, which honestly aren't all that great anyhow.What makes this film great for me is the structure of an old(er), beaten down cynical man going through grief, who bumps into a young, fresh woman who doesn't really know who she is or why she wants what she wants. Schneider has said that Bertolucci kept her in the dark during much of the filming. One hopes it was to evoke this pure, almost wide-eyed performance from her and not out of any disrespect or cruelty, although Schneider late said she'd never work with him again. Her performance here is effortless. More importantly, there's a chemistry between her and Brando that works. It may seem strange to talk about chemistry in a movie where the male lead rapes and bullies the female lead, but it's there. Watch the scene in the bathroom, where he's shaving, and marvel at the spontaneous-sounding dialogue and the feeling that a real relationship is there.Brando is perfect for his role. The story unfolds slowly (they'd never make a film with this kind of pacing today), and Brando becomes at least somewhat more sympathetic (and complex) as it goes on. This isn't brute Brando but rather complex, deeply wounded Brando who brings out the brute in him only to keep the world at bay. After his catharsis he shows another side of himself, probably a more typical side, to Schneider and she just can't cope--it's hard for me to tell, even after repeated viewings, if it's because she's getting married to someone else (how happy she'll be remains in serious doubt to me), because she's afraid of a three-dimensional Brando who really seems now to want her for more than casual sex, or what. In some ways the ending was arbitrary, but it still struck me as more plausible and organic than similar sudden endings in The Night Porter and The Marriage of Maria Braun.Throughout, Bertolucci shoots most of the interior scenes between Schneider and Brando at sunset. Bathed in orange, they have a stillness and yet an intensity the other scenes lack. It seems orange is the color Bertolucci set aside for deep revelations and realizations. The film is distrubing, but somehow also cathartic. The feeling of wanting to say "F--- the world" is one many of us can relate to, something Brando himself did many times in his career.The print is scratched and the soundtrack somewhat tinny. There are numerous times where dirt or fuzz in the gate can be seen on the top or bottom edge of the frame for whole scenes. This is a film that cries out for a full-blown restoration. The DVD contains nothing else but the trailer, and a strange trailer it is. You'd think a DVD of a movie this famous would feature commentaries, documentaries, where-they-are-now type of featurettes, etc. This classic has been short-changed.But *do* many people today see Last Tango In Paris as a classic? This is somehthing I wondered as I read reviews online after seeing the DVD. Heralded as a masterpiece and a turning point in cinema when it was released, it is now clear that it was anything but. Rather than continue with personal films that sometimes disturbed the psyche and questioned the soul of the moviegoer, Hollywood and then other filmmakers turned to empty spectacle as the 70s waned, trading boobs for lightsabers. Last Tango was hailed in 1972 as a beginning of a new cinema, but it was also the end of it. With a few exceptions (The Unbearable Lightness of Being comes quickest to mind) this sort of film would never be made again, and Last Tango has become in some ways anachronistic. Just reading the online reviews, most of them probably written by people in their 20s for whom Terminator 2 is an ancient movie, it becomes clear that we don't really understand this sort of picture anymore, and are made uncomfortable by it. There's no simple line of action. There's no "plot." There are long stretches with no dialogue, or at least where the characters don't tell you in dialogue what they are doing. As television and movies have merged in style, technique and subject matter, Last Tango and other films from the period become more like museum relics than living, breathing cinema.Perhaps that's one reason why we haven't seen a restoration. Unless Criterion gets its hands on this film, I don't have much hopes. Too bad, because Last Tango represents a whole type of filmmaking that's largely unknown today, even to film "students," and if it is known it's becoming more of a curiosity than, as I said, living, breathing cinema. All the more reason to rent this, then, and witness a whole approach to movie-making that no longer exists--certainly not in the USA.

review/text: The Great God Om wakes up in tortoise-form just as an eagle hurls him into a compost pile. If you're the type of person who worries about being struck by lightning while reading the wrong kind of book, stay away from &quot;Small Gods.&quot; Terry Pratchett blasphemes against (or maybe I should say 'explains') religion in this book, and most philosophies too. This is one of his more seriously comic Discworld books, although only Pratchett (and Monty Python) would even consider an attempt at a comedy about the Grand InquisitionIf Galileo had muttered, &quot;Eppur si muove!&quot; to the Inquisition on Discworld, he no doubt would have been referring to the gigantic turtle that carries the world on its back. He would have burned too, old as he was, if Vorbis the exquisitor had overheard him blaspheming against the perfect sphere of Discworld, which orbits around the Sun &quot;as Man orbits the central truth of Om.&quot;Meanwhile Om scrabbles out of the compost heap and discovers Brutha, a young novice who is hoeing melons in the temple garden. Brutha is the only person left on Discworld who truly believes in Om, and really bad things happen to gods who lose all of their believers.However, Brutha almost loses his god. Vorbis the exquisitor discovers the small tortoise hissing at him and doesn't recognize it as his God, Om. He flips it over, inserts a couple of pebbles into its shell so it can't right itself, then sticks Om on the garden wall to broil in the sun.Vorbis is a bad 'un.After this temporary setback (setback, get it?), &quot;Small Gods&quot; carries on with the tale of Om and Brutha and their adventures as Om tries to figure out why he ended up as a tortoise, and Brutha attempts to discover truth in religion. This book is a work of fiction. All the characters and events portrayed in this book are fictional, and any resemblance to real people or incidents is purely coincidental. However if you read very carefully, you may spot coincidental resemblances to Tom&aacute;s de Torquemada, Jesus, any number of classical Greek philosophers, early Christian saints, Old Testament prophets, and Galileo Galilei.

review/text: This is a good action packed movie sure to please the science fiction/fantasy enthusiast. The story starts with an alternate history of the moon landing with an alien discovery twist and moves on to become a fast-paced action movie with the familiar heroes except for one, a new romantic interest. The new romantic interest, played by Rosie Huntington-Whitely, fails to measure up to the previous one played by Megan Fox.The sound and video are both first rate and will rattle your rafters if you crank up the sound high enough. The story line holds ones interest and provides enough surprise elements to keep one guessing. This is a worthy addition to the franchise and a keeper for any collector of this genre.I recommend it highly.

review/text: I didn't get very far with this cd series so my review will not be very thorough or technical. But what I would have wanted to know before I made my purchase, is that it is a very regional dialect that is spoken in this cd set (Lebanese, Syrian, Palestinian dialect). Which is fine if that is what you need, but since my husband is Egyptian, I would like to be able to communicate with him and his family in their own dialect. It was actually pretty comical listening to the first cd with him because he kept saying, "What? No, we say it this way..." until we just turned it off.The Egyptian dialect is also more widely recognized throughout the Arab world since Egyptian movies, music, etc. are a big part of Middle Eastern popular culture - so even if you don't have Egyptian family, I think that it would not make sense to learn the spoken Arabic with this dialect - it's difficult enough already!

review/text: At first I was forced to read &quot;The Mayor of Casterbridge&quot; in school more than 12 years ago. Reading it slowly made an impact on my life. This book always served a special purpose in my life. It introduced me to the wide world of Literature. It sort of enlighten my interest and liking for English literature. Now re-reading it not only brought back fond memories of my yester school days but also renewed my liking to one of the greatest writer of all time Thomas Hardy.Through this novel I came to the understanding of Irony and oxymoron. Hardy totally wrote with a sense of awareness of human characteristic and he had a amazing style of mixed humour with tragedy.His protagonist,Michael Henchard's life was under the microscope of Hardy.I love the way the story began I quote:&quot;ONE evening of late summer, before the nineteenth century had reached one-third of its span, a young man and woman, the latter carrying a child, were approaching the large village of Weydon-Priors, in Upper Wessex, on foot. &quot; I love the Englishness and the sense of intriguing events that would follow...In brief, Michael Henchard was a drunk who sold his wife and daughter at the fair. Later he realised his mistakes he work real hard and eventually became the mayor of Casterbridge. His life took another twist 20 years later when his wife and daughter came back to his life plus a few more other characters adding on the complexity of his life.Soonafter events unfolded and many things became to go against his way and then came his downfall. Indeed Michael Henchard's rise and fall were filled with compelling details and his encounters with numerous intestering people.What I love most about this novel was the way Hardy depicted Henchard's behaviours and thoughts and totally enhanced his weak character and irresponsibleness with dashes of ironies. His sardonic literary style were brilliant and at the same time he also vividly described the scenery and situations. Another greatest of Hardy was his ability to create innovative characters still account for in modern contemporary days and he was a pioneer in analysising human's weakness and blended it into his creation. It's a vintage classic,psychoanalytic and intriguingly written ,a must read for all books lover.

review/text: This remains the definitive biography of Columbus. Morison was one of the greatest historians ever to practice the craft--his scholarship still holds up today. He was also a master of the written word, unlike most professional historians today.Morison enumerates the reasons why he admires Columbus, but he also catalogs the man's misdeeds--for example, Morison uses the word &quot;genocide&quot; to describe Columbus's treatment of the Indians as governor of Hispaniola. Morison gives his readers the facts they need to form their own opinion of Columbus. (I do not share Morison's admiration for the man.)I must correct the astonishingly ignorant remarks of the reviewer who identified himself as &quot;A reader from New York City&quot; and entitled his review &quot;So much ignorance my God...&quot;Here goes:1) The reviewer asserted that Morison was not, in fact, an admiral. Actually, Morison did receive the title. FDR made Morison an honorary admiral when he commissioned the scholar to write the naval history of the US role in WWII. (Morison produced a 12-volume epic. It's still in print.)2) The reviewer regurgitates a number of questions about Columbus's origins that he apparently drew from another book by a revisionist historian (Kirkpatrick Sale?). The questions the reviewer repeats are good ones, but they are questions that remain open because the evidence to answer them conclusively probably does not exist. If the reviewer were a trained historian, he might understand that.

review/text: This DVD set is much like the other DVD sets released so far in terms of how many episodes this set includes. That being said...Season 2, 7th Voyage holds 13 episodes...or episodes 131-143.Which includes the Post-Arabasta Arc, Goat Island Arc, and the Rainbow Mist Arc...which is just enough to leave viewers salivating for the start of Season 3, 1st Voyage (the start of the Skypeia arc) as for the Amazon price it's a bit much to ask for as these are all filler episodes included in this entire DVD set, but it's still a good buy if you can find it cheaper.The Post-Arabasta arc (ep. 131-135) is a pretty comedic arc for the most part but it's mostly just a range of episodes centered around each one of the Strawhat pirates either having a flashback of their own personal life, goofing off, or making short side trips on other islands where they help others.The Goat Island arc (ep. 136-138) is a really short filler arc, which thank goodness One Piece keeps a large majority of their fillers short. This arc just centers around the Strawhats running from the Marines and landing on an island with an old geezer named Zenny (the old man on the cover of this DVD set). Zenny is an old man that has a dream of becoming a pirate even though he's clearly too old to pursue that dream, the Strawhats still push to help him achieve that dream in the end.The Rainbow Mist arc (ep. 139-143) is an excellent filler arc in my personal opinion. The Strawhats land on Ruluka Island where a strange folktale of a mysterious cloak of mist is said to appear during certain times. An old man by the name of Professor Henzo, whom is researching the mist, lost a group of his friends to the mist a long long time ago. Needless to say the mist appears while the Strawhats are on Ruluka Island and Henzo is reunited with his friends inside the mist....but they don't recognize him? Why? because in the realm of the mist time is completely stopped and Henzo is an old geezer and his friends are still as young as the day they disappeared.I wanted to give a brief description of each arc this set contains without giving away too much about the arcs themselves. It's a product worth buying but at a lower price, personally I'd pay in the $25-$35 range for it.Note: Since the release of this item, Amazon has lowered the price to a much better range than it was originally listed. It was in the $40-$50 range, now it is much cheaper and right in the range that I personally would've bought it for as said in the review.

review/text: Originally written in the 1950's for serial publication, the Foundation Trilogy (and the additional books written in the series) is often hailed as Asimov's greatest achievement. Certainly, the original trilogy is high on my list of "must read" science fiction.The Foundation Trilogy presents us with a universe controlled by the Galactic Empire. The Empire has governed the known universe for tens of thousands of years and appears to be at the zenith of its power. But the Empire is burdened by the weight of the bureaucracy needed to govern millions of worlds. Trantor, the administrative seat of the Empire is a planet completely covered by buildings. A vast, planet-wide city, it houses the millions of functionaries necessary to administer the Empire. As wealthy and as powerful as the Empire seems, disaster is just around the corner. However, only one man, Hari Seldon, is able to recognize the Empire's impending doom.Hari is a mathematician who has developed the breakthrough field of Psychohistory. Psychohistory is the mathematical process by which the actions of people can be predicted in advance. This science does not work for predicting individual behavior, but instead predicts the behavior of a mass of humanity (billions of people). By analyzing the Empire with Psychohistorical methods, Hari has determined that the Empire will crumble within 500 years, plunging the known universe into barbarism that will prevent a new Empire from arising for 30,000 years!Fortunately, Hari has developed a plan that, if executed, will curtail the period of galactic decay to a mere 1,000 years. However, it is unclear whether Hari can persuade the Emperor to allow him to move forward with his plan. Can Hari and his fellow scientists save the universe? Or will the shortsighted aims of a greedy, grasping Emperor derail their plans?Although these works are science fiction, they would probably not be classed as "hard" science fiction. There is some necessary discussion of scientific principles, but not enough to bore any "technophobes" who may be reading the novels. The trilogy focuses mainly on the people involved in the Seldon plan, as opposed to the technology being used by them. Asimov always enjoyed speculating on how people would evolve and react to advanced technology and he lets his imagination run wild here.Two significant milestones were achieved with this work. First, Asimov became one of the first writers to theorize that atomic power would revolutionize society. Second, I believe Asimov was the first to present a planet that was entirely covered by buildings. The universe he creates is engaging and filled with fascinating, believable characters. Since the books were serialized, many chapters (especially in the first volume) contain complete plot lines and make the book easy to read if you need to break up your reading time into small increments. Lots of political intrigue and maneuvering keeps the action flowing through all three books.Foundation sets the stage for the rest of the series. Hari Seldon is introduced and his theories of Psychohistory are explained. Then Seldon's Foundation is established on Terminus, a remote planet at the edge of the Empire, with the goal of shortening the period of barbarism the universe will experience. However, there are no Psychohistorians located in the Foundation... only scientists. The planet has very few native metals and virtually no defenses. The scientists must figure out how to rule their world and fend off avaricious neighbors as the Empire begins to crumble. The majority of this first volume contains vignettes chronicling the Foundation leaders responding to various crises that Hari Seldon predicted centuries before. The crises are varied and plausible. The solutions to the problems that arise are not solved by any miraculous means, but by tough, clever political maneuvering. Watching the crises and their solutions unfold is very enthralling and keeps you turning the pages at a rapid pace.There is something here for everyone to enjoy. If you have never read this fine trilogy, buy a copy today. You won't be disappointed.

review/text: Sea StarOrphan of ChincoteagueBy Marguerite HenryIllustrated by Wesley DennisReviewed by MadelineSea Star is the magnificent sequel to Misty, which was thought of as Miss Henry's only Chincoteague story. This novel depicts the beloved characters Paul and Maureen, along with the wonderful Misty, as they encounter an orphaned foal when at Tom's Cove. With its mamma dead, the foal can't feed and will die, unless Paul and Maureen have something to say about it. The two children take in the little foal in and give him milk from a mare at a nurse-farm and from a bottle, naming the foal Sea Star, for the star-shaped blaze on his forehead. Over all, anyone who fell in love with Misty, will fall in love with Sea Star just the same.

review/text: The book, Fahrenheit 451 by Ray Bradbury, is a perfect example of a science fiction book. This book is about the life of a fire fighter named Guy Montag who lives in a futuristic city where books are banned. The job of fire fighters in his view of the future are to set books and the houses they are hiding in on fire. The reasoning for this is that books are said to be evil and contain many different thoughts and emotions that are considered "dangerous" if people are exposed to them. This book pretty difficult to read based on its challenging vocabulary and its confusing situations. I would recommend this book to people no younger than 7th grade based on the content of the book, and I would recommend it to people with a strong interest in science fiction and futuristic books.

review/text: This review refers to the DVD edition of "Run Lola Run" (or "Lola Rennt")....I had been meaning to view this film for quite some time. I had heard many good things about it, but kept putting it off. From what I knew of the story,about a girl only having so much time to save her boyfriends life, I was expecting something more like the Johnny Depp film "The Nick Of Time". So when I finally got around to it...wow..was I surprised and delighted by this cinematic treat.(and I was mad at myself for not watching it before this!)It's one of those you want to watch again immediately.The film is heart pumping, creative, innovative and fresh. The story will have you thinking about it for quite sometime. Our heroine Lola, finds herself with only 20 minutes to save Manni's life. It seems he has accidentally lost a huge some of money and the men it belongs to are not exactly the forgiving kind. He frantically calls Lola, as she is the one with the ideas.Lola immediately goes into action to try to prevent the horrors of what will happen if Manni doesn't come up with the money. So right from the start we are intrigued to see if she will pull it off.The film doesn't stop here though, it's just beginning. In 20 minutes, many things can happen to alter the course of a life. 'What if's' are the question here. What if that car was just a little slower, or what if a conversation went just a little differently? These are little things that can make big differences when it counts. It's a roller coaster of a ride, as we watch, and cheer for Lola,as she attempts to change the fates.The photography of this film is exceptional. Imagine trying to keep up with a running person all the time, and still coming up with incredible shot after shot. The music is fabulous and very much a part of the story.Franka Potente(Barbara from "Blow")is wonderful in her performance of Lola. Directed by Tom Tykwer, this German film is a must see for anyone who loves foreign films or just fine filmmaking.The DVD is presented in German(DD5.1 or Stereo Surround), with English or French subtitles. It may also be viewed in English(also DD5.1 and 2.0) if you prefer. There's a music video and commentary by both the Director and Potente that may be viewed during the film. It may be viewed in either the original theatrical widescreen aspect ratio or a full screen version. I highly recommend the widescreen that takes in all the great photography.Don't miss this exhilarting ride...go for it...Lauriealso recommended:Winter KillsLuzhin Defence (Full Screen Version)Blind Horizon

review/text: So, here is the deal. I have played and beat every Tomb Raider game out there except for the Game Boy Advance one. Anywho, I ordered this game in September of last year, and delay after delay made me mad. So I cancelled my order and waited until the game was OFFICALLY released for PC(since i dont have a PS2). There are quite a few new things that I like about the game:>Lara looks awsome. New clothes and makeup, with a whole new personality that you actually get to control when she talkes with people.>The new moves are pretty sweet too. Stealth sucked for me at first b/c i just like to get out my guns and take em out. In the beginning, you dont even have ammo for your weapon(no unlimited signature pistols). But you get to use stealth a lot so you'll get good with it.>I also like that you get a nice peaceful break where you can collect yourself and gain some money and valuable information, after your initial run from the police in Paris.There are however some drawbacks which i'll disucss now.>There has always been more glitches with the computer version of a game like this. Lara steps up stairs now and is super sensitive to the steps. Example: If you walk up the step and press left or right, she does a full 90 degree turn in that direction. So be carefull or you'll get frustrated very quickly. Or maybe that is just me.>There are some points that the game just completely glitches and you have to turn it off and restart your computer. So sufficiet to say "SAVE A LOT!" If Lara herself starts to look funny and glitch up, turn it off. It will only cuase you problems later on.>The controls are a little different, and still just as frustrating as ever.All in all though I think that the game was worth the wait...for the most part. I'm looking foward to being able the play the Kurtis character 3/4 into the game. Until then though I recommend the game so far. Just so you know, I'm half way thru the game, and I bought the strategy guide, which is well worth the 15 bucks.

review/text: This new edition of Sextette presents the film in Widescreen for the first time, with a new transfer from the original print. This corrects the fact that when the previous DVD release was pressed, an inferior print of the film was used, which meant that the VHS version was actually better than the DVD.As a fan of the late, great Mae West I would like to take the time to correct some factual errors repeated on the Amazon page for the original DVD by some of the other reviewers, and add a few comments of my own. Miss West was 84 when she made this film in 1977; she died three years later on November 22, 1980, at the age of 87. She did in fact attend the Hollywood premiere, and received a Lifetime Achievement award from After Dark magazine the same year. The play Sextette was a minor comedy she starred in and wrote in 1961, not the 1920's. When she toured with the stage play she was 68. While it certainly is true that she was but a parody of herself by the time she made the film, many of her fans were grateful for the chance to see her perform one last time, as both her screen and television appearances were far too few in relation to her talent and comedic genius.The cast included many big-league supporting actors and cameos. Timothy Dalton, George Raft, Rona Barrett, Dom De Louise, Tony Curtis, Ringo Starr, George Hamilton, Walter Pidgeon and even Alice Cooper all had scenes with the star, resulting in a film that can only be classified as pure camp. It was a tribute to Miss West's reputation that so many of these stars were anxious to work with her. I once met a lighting technician who was assigned to the original stage tour of Sextette, and he confirmed what I had always heard - Mae West was regarded as a total professional and a consummate artist by all who worked with her, and absolutely loved by the crews on both her movies and plays.Many critics were quick to promote the rumor that she was totally senile at the time of filming, and there were many rumors about how she had to have her lines fed to her through an ear-piece. This rumor is belied by watching her lip-synch her way through any one of several songs on the soundtrack. On "Happy Birthday, 21" for example, her timing is absolutely perfect and her lips move in complete harmony with the recording, not a minor feat for someone her age. On a few of the funnier lines, her delivery is classic West at its best, and she shows flashes of her famous impeccable timing just as often as she shows her extreme age. Yes, she looks, moves and talks like someone in their late 80's, but what can one expect? The fact that she had the stamina and chutzpah at that age to even appear before the cameras was amazing in itself.Strictly for fans? Absolutely, but I for one am glad she bothered. If you want classic Mae West get a hold of I'm No Angel, She Done Him Wrong or Klondike Annie and see her in her prime, but if you are a devoted fan you will want to see this film as well.PS - It's about time that this woman had a major documentary devoted to her talents. Her TV appearances, which are almost completely unavailable, include her 1959 Academy Award duet of BABY IT'S COLD OUTSIDE with Rock Hudson and guest stints on the Dean Martin and Red Skelton variety shows. Her only TV appearance available on DVD is her guest shot on Mr. Ed. The few of her TV guest shots that I've seen (which was before VCR let alone DVD was invented) were great, and I'd pay big bucks to find a DVD documentary or collection that includes them all.

The college descriptions are more like advertorials written by the colleges themselves rathen than objective and independent analysis with pros and cons.

review/text: I was excited about seeing this movie. I really was. It started out like the book, kind of, but of course, like so many movies today, the special effects took over and then we went on the most boring roller coster ride that was ever created. Suddenly, the house wasn't just evil, it had to be the actual evil man who inhabited it. Yeah, that wasn't in the book. Then it tried to regain our sympathy after it tortured us with stupid special effects by implying that the evil main character was really into killing his child laborers. Sorry, no sympathy here. And then, just for fun, some guy gets his head chopped off for no real reason, a picture comes to life, a door comes to life, a statue comes to life, Elenor goes crazy -- all not scary -- and then these little kid statues say, &quot;Help me! Help me!&quot; Then somehow, someone becomes the great grand-daughter of the evil guy and she proceeds to not get out of the way when he slams into her, causing severe internal bleeding. Finally, the movie ends and the two people who didn't die WALK out of the main gates, seeming to forget that they had driven there. Anyone who let this movie fool them into believing that it was good has never read the book and is probably way too into special effects for their own good. Even the actors couldn't save this. Stick with the book. For being written in the &quot;olden days&quot; it still has more horror than this movie could ever produce.

review/text: Ah, Ulysses. What can one say that has not already been said? It seems that everyone who has read it, and indeed even those who have not, has an opinion regarding Joyce's seminal work. And now, after finally turning over the last page, I hereby add my own name to the long list of critics who have attempted to analyze this novel, and who, although perhaps unwittingly, have also added to the length of the grin on the face of its author--that eloquent literary trickster, that infuriating kicker-of-the-wheels of language, old double J himself.What immediately strikes you upon reading the first few pages of Ulysses is that, despite the cloud of mystique surrounding it, it is only a novel--a collection of words written by one man. It is not, as some would have you believe, some sort of prophetic vision of mankind, a work of art so highly conceived and perfectly executed that it transcends all space and time. No, it is only, as all books are, a story. And thereby it can be reduced to this: a man wakes up, walks around, and then goes to sleep. If you're looking for anything more than that, then keep looking--because you won't find it here. It is simply the story of one long (and I do mean long) day.But the plot is of little importance in this book. What the author wants you to focus on is style and meaning; and there is plenty of both to go around. In fact, there is too much. When Joyce attempts to reconstruct the evolution of the english language in a mock birth of modern speech and literature, he crosses the line that separates amusing people from annoying ones. In passages throughout the book--too numerous to mention in this limited review space--you often get the urge to say to its author, &quot;Okay, that's enough; we get it already.&quot; But on and on he goes, confusing you, irritating you, making you wish you had never started reading this damn book in the first place. So why keep reading, you ask? Because there are parts of the book, again too numerous to mention, that for sheer beauty and clarity of description rival anything ever written. Joyce's portrait of a grizzled old sailor in a scene towards the end of the book quickly comes to mind as a shining reminder that there are rewards for making the long and sometimes frustrating journey on which he wishes to take you.And that, I suppose, is what Ulysses is all about. You love it at times, you hate it at times, but by the time you reach the end you feel, well, something. And no more should we expect of our authors.

Oh, it's music, more than it is literature, only you have to play it instead of just listen to it. More like a score of notes and symbols. Some people can't read music, can't hear the result. Hell, I can't ready music either, but this book is the only thing I have *ever* found that matches my natural astonishment at the intense immediacy of being alive in all it's frighteningly beautiful detail. If and only if you have the right type of cosmic laughter and &quot;tape recorder&quot; like open eyes inside of you, it will play your mind wild and hard, and you *will* smile, because it *is* you.It can ruin you, though, to &quot;he said, she said&quot; type of literature.

She was no more: the trembling skeleton of a twig burnt in the fire, an odour of rosewood and wetted ashes. She had saved him from being trampled underfoot and had gone, scarcely having been.

This is a wonderful book; Ms Jensen demonstrates some great skills of storytelling, characterisation and emotion in this tale of a widow who has to confront and deal with the man she jilted seven years earlier and who she believes to have been ultimately responsible for her husband's death. And yet she discovers that the Duke of Conovar is nothing like she imagined. And very soon, because of the cruel gossip which starts to spread about him, she becomes his staunchest defender rather than his enemy.There are some heartwrenching scenes in this book, as well as some dialogue which had me glued to the page. It's impossible not to be touched by Conovar's sincerity or Deirdre's anguish as each finds out that they were mistaken about each other and about other characters whose actions impinged on their lives and destroyed their relationship seven years earlier.I thoroughly recommend this book, and I'm completely bemused by Susan Johnson's review, below.

review/text: Walker wrote this biography of an ancestor who is a remarkable figure in American history. Born a slave, Free Frank used his free time on evenings and Sundays to extract saltpeter from guano in Kentucky, as well as surveying land, and made enough money to first buy his wife out of slavery, then, with her income as a freewoman, to buy himself out of slavery. His industry, sterling character, and persistence eventually allowed him to become wealthy as a real estate developer on the Illinois frontier. He bought all of his children out of slavery, and upon his death, all of his grandchildren as well. And he did it all without ever learning to write.While certainly atypical, he is a reminder that even though the legal system was set up to the detriment of blacks throughout the slave states, it was possible for a slave with a careless or sympathetic master to become free -- and once free, to become wealthy. This is an inspiring story. Just don't read this one book and assume that you know everything you need to know about American slavery. This is the encouraging reminder that even a bigoted legal system wasn't enough to keep a hard worker from moving ahead in the relatively free market of the American frontier.

review/text: This film should be required viewing in every high school or college in America. Aside from being one of the first animated British feature films, as a poignant parable, it so perfectly explains how the Russian Revolution turned a bad situation into one of the three worst of the 20th century (the others being Nazi Germany and Communist China). Reviewers harping on the film's "upbeat" ending sound unaware of just how prophetic that ending turned out to be (remember what happened to Soviet Communism in 1989). This is a great film which -- incredibly -- may have now slipped into the public domain. (...)

This is a "classic album under review" which basically has a bunch of fat old guys talking about how great AC/DC is. The clincher for me was the fact that they had an AC/DC tribute band on to play the guitar riffs from this album. A TRIBUTE BAND?!?!? I'm sure that was great fun for those guys to do, but I think the people watching would rather see the actual band playing the songs. This DVD went on WAY too long and only had little snippets of the band playing live. Way too much filler for me and not what I thought this DVD was going to be. I do not recommend it.

review/text: First off, allow me to correct a common mistake that was made by more than one reviewer here: This is most certainly not the first film ever made where animated characters interact with live actors. Pete's Dragon (1977), Mary Poppins (1964) and Song of the South (1946) all predate it, and if you want a lesson in cartoon history, so does Gertie the Dinosaur (1914). But that doesn't mean Who Framed Roger Rabbit is not a landmark film. It was revolutionary for its degree of interaction between the toons and the human characters, done so perfectly that they seem completely natural at first glance, but then amaze when you take a closer look - little things like Jessica Rabbit pinching Eddie Valiant's cheek, or Roger Rabbit hiding under the water in Valiant's sink, or beneath his coat, little details that took very creative special effects to be made convincing. It's also unique and original in the fact that some of it takes place in the real world, featuring animated characters, and some in an animated world, featuring live actors; and in that manner, it predates Cool World, Space Jam and anything following.Who Framed Roger Rabbit is wonderfully funny, directed more at an adult audience than children. Bob Hoskins and Christopher Lloyd make a terrific impression in the lead roles, and manage to stay remarkably serious and convincing while conversing and interacting with entirely imaginary characters. Charles Fleischer is beyond brilliant in the voice of Roger Rabbit (as well as that of Benny the Cab) and Kathleen Turner as Jessica Rabbit is also terrific, a femme fatale so classic that it's ridiculous. The entire film excels with intelligent humor that would appeal to both children and adults, and it's a treat for animation buffs, with references to historical toons from the Foxy cartoons of the 20s, through Betty Boop, Dumbo and Bambi to Bugs Bunny and Mickey Mouse.Who Framed Roger Rabbit is one of the defining films of my childhood; I think that's true for almost anyone born in the 80s. I still have a warm place in my heart for Roger and Eddie Valiant, and a cold one for Judge Doom, who gave me nightmares for weeks after I saw it upon its initial release when I was four (he still gives me chills, by the way, when he first starts talking in his squeaky voice). If you somehow manages to avoid it, do watch it, and if you're willing, it's well worth the purchase, too.

review/text: One of the better books that I've read over the past year. Dr. Eby provides a biographical review of the miracles that God has performed in his life, beginning with his birth in the pre-depression era through the 1980's. I heard about this book on the radio and it was described as Dr. Eby's trip to heaven after his clinical death due to an accident. What I found was a wonderful collection of stories about how God worked miracles throughout his entire life, including an amazing story of his brief trip to heaven (he describes it in great detail -- I can't wait!) and a brief trip to hell (enough of a description to scare the salvation right into a non-believer). Dr. Eby is a great story teller and the book is very easy to read and enjoy. A very uplifting and &quot;feel good&quot; book. A great book to read to kids too!

The third time you read it, your earlier suspicion will prove true as you successively laugh, gasp, swear, snort, breathe, moan, think, and yearn in anticipation of the occurrences of these events on the page. By the fourth time you read it, you will realize you never stopped reading it - that even the interlude of years between your first and second reading was only a momentary pause to catch the breath of your life outside the Book; and that you made a habit of the yearly 16-June read merely for the sake of ordering that interval of months between the readings - and during those intervals you will find yourself repeating passages in your head that you would never have imagined to be memorizable. Each time you emerge from this book you will find yourself unmistakably changed - your eyes opened to a further deepness of what it is to be human, what it is to be yourself. Joyce will demand everything of you, but he will give you a greater everything in return.If you have tried to read this book before, and didn't make it - well, i understand. The first time, it is admittedly extraordinarily difficult. But turn, if you will, to page 903 of the hardback Knopf Everyman edition, and read the bit of catechism &quot;What in water did Bloom, waterlover, drawer of water, watercarrier returning to the range, admire?&quot; that extends through 905. Then go to the beginning, or wherever you left off if you prefer, and start again. If not now, then someday - maybe years from now - but do it. And then do it again.

review/text: Before listening to this recording, I had been just about convinced that Haendel's keyboard music was, at best, harmless, and at worst, disposable. How mistaken I was, and how apt Ludger Remy was to convince me otherwise. These suites, the 8 'Great Suites,' Haendel's major testament to Baroque keyboard music, are played with verve, character, courage, and nuance. Ludger Remy's subtlety is little short of brilliant, although I must say that occasionally he sacrifices grace for excitement, but then again, that harpsichord is a unique animal and occasionally one cannot blame the performer, really.Best of all, Ludger Remy breaks many of the conventions of the Dutch-dominated school of harpsichord performance and delivers and album defined by character and a unique sense of articulation and rhythm. Each suite movement is intricately crafted and interpreted. The Suites in A-Major and F-Major are both heart-wrenching, while the Suite in g-minor is shown by Remy to finally be playable (I thought that it was near impossible).Kudos to this fine performer, of whom we hope to hear more in the future.

review/text: Howard Zinn's approach to history comes directly from his own life experience. He saw the baby boom part of the twentieth century history evolve before his eyes with major events, such as the Civil Rights Movement and the further activism that occurred thereafter, and the effects of the war on Vietnam with archival work, to name a few. HOWARD ZINN ON HISTORY is a collection of essays and articles previously published in notable journals and magazines, such as the Midwestern Archivist and Saturday Review. Zinn examines topics that have affected him academically as well as personally, and appear somewhat out dated but timeless at the same time because of how much has progressed from the time he originally wrote the pieces.The book may serve as a teaching tool for a political or American history classes because of its small format. It is the type of book that will raise questions for the casual history reader as well as the any history major. However, there are serious political overtones that resonate with the majority of the essays that may suggest Zinn's revisionist perspective on history, but he exposes the study of history and the sum of its parts. Zinn states: "The scholar may swear to his neutrality on the job, but whether he be physicist, historian, or archivist, his work will tend, in this theory, to maintain the existing social order by perpetuating its values, by legitimizing its priorities, by justifying its wars, perpetuating its prejudices, contributing to its xenophobia, and apologizing for its class order" (p. 167).Zinn opens the door to history as well as an inquiry into how it is shaped and formed. He probes important topics that have often been overlooked, which raises important questions, what can be considered history, and how long does it take to be history?

review/text: The Forsyte Saga is a sprawling drama in 3 Volumes/novels which won John Galsworthy the Nobel Prize for Literature in 1932. I enjoyed all 3 Volumes immensely - the writing is most beautiful, the storylines absorbing, the characters felt "real" and the dialogue wonderfully engaging.All 3 Volumes are published by Penguin. Each Volume has 800-900 pages and is divided into 3 Books:1. Volume 1: "The Man of Property", "In Chancery" and "To Let".2. Volume 2: "The White Monkey", "The Silver Spoon" and "Swan Song".3. Volume 3: "Maid In Waiting", "Flowering Wilderness" and "Over the River".Here's the gist of the story from each Volume:Volume 1: Meet the Forsytes - a rich, upper-class family in old England. Before you start, study the 'Family Tree' page first because it's helpful to remember how the numerous major characters are related. Note: My review will not be revealing any plot that you can't already gather from the Family Tree. The story begins in the late 1870s with Soames Forsyte (an old-fashioned, smart solicitor and art-collector) falling in love with a penniless beauty, Irene (pron.: "I-re-nee"). They marry but Irene is unhappy because she does not love Soames. Later, she meets a young architect, Philip Bosinney - they fall in love and have an affair. Problem is, Philip is June Forsyte (Soames' niece)'s fiance. Suspense, drama and great tragedy ensue when Soames and June find out. Some years pass. Jolyon (a cousin of Soames and an outcast of the family) and Irene are thrown together by circumstances and they fall in love. Irene has his child, Jon. Soames is heartbroken a second time. There is a bitter divorce. Soames later marries a French woman, Annette and they have a child, Fleur. Fleur and Jon grow up and fall in love with each other, unaware of the feud between their families...Note: Both the book and TV-series (adapted in 2002) feature Chopin's music (which is played by Irene on the piano). So if you like Chopin, you'll be pleased! Another thing is that the reader will either love/hate Irene. The author only describes her actions, but never let us know her thoughts or feelings. Everything we read about Irene is from the eyes or viewpoint of the other characters. Hence, on the pages, she appears cold and distant. Personally, I do not like Irene; my sympathy lies with Soames (whom I feel is unfairly and cruelly treated by Irene).Volume 2 is about Fleur and her relationship with her ageing father (Soames) and her husband (Michael Mont). Initially, Fleur appears to handle married life well - 'grooming' her husband for Parliament and throwing social parties. But 3 crises emerge to test her: a court action filed by a former friend (lots of mud-slinging here), having to "manage" Wilfrid Desert (her husband's best friend who is in love with her) and the return of Jon to England and their rekindled love. There is also an engaging subplot involving an impoverished balloon-seller, Tony Bicket and his wife.Volume 3 is unputdownable (like Volume 1). Here, we meet the Charwells, distant relations of the Forsytes (Michael Mont's mother is a Charwell). The time period is 1920s to early 1930s. The heroine is Elizabeth ("Dinny"), a most charming and endearing character. In Book 1, she tries to help her brother, Hubert who faces a murder charge. She also has to fend off 2 (unwelcome) admirers. In Book 2, Dinny falls in love (at last) with someone who first appeared in Volume 2. Their relationship is not smooth-sailing and you just know Dinny is headed for a heartbreak. There is also a troubling religion issue with no practical solution in sight. In Book 3, Dinny helps her younger sister, Clare who runs away after physical abuse by her husband. There is later a court proceeding (which is superbly written). Meanwhile, Fleur provides some smart advice and shows her generosity in an unexpected way. As for Dinny, she has not recovered from her earlier heartbreak but a new suitor appears on the scene (and he is really quite perfect...). Volume 3 is romantic and I loved it best.The Forstye Saga is a glorious and unforgetable read. It has the power to draw every sorts of emotion from the reader (joy, sadness, suspense, anger, laughter, tears). Put this title high on your list of must-reads. All 3 Volumes are highly recommended!

Out of the box, the 1022n is much faster than the older printers, even after I added memory to many of the older models. It's a bit louder as well, but the additional speed is worth it. The paper tray is much easier to manage in the 1022n. It couldn't have been easier to hook up - good riddance to the parallel port connection. I don't know how you can do better than HP LaserJets!

Both Marquez and Mongo use bizarre characters and situations to hide their true commentary on their respective societies. Marquez writes about Latin America and Mongo writes about North America. I would recommend both books as essential reading and would suggest reading Mongo if you enjoy reading Marquez.

review/text: I bought this unit recently as i wanted a personal media player with good facilities and a large storage capacity (I bought the 8GB model). The unit looks lovely, has a very nice user interface, and excellent sound and picture quality.I bought an 8GB micro SD HC card to increase the total storage to 16GB.Here's the catch. The firmware in the unit is buggy; this makes the player unreliable and very annoying to use.After doing a full charge (12 hours), I loaded up the player from WMP11 in MTP sync mode - this requires you to sync to 2 separate devices: internal memory and external card. Once I had completed the upload, which took several hours, I removed the USB cable and the player rebooted.Ever since then, it has intermittently refused to power up. Sometimes when you switch it on, after displaying the Sansa splash screen for a few seconds, it simply switches itself off, freezes or crashes. On other occasions it gets stuck, saying 'refreshing database'. This occurs about 50% of the time, even after a full charge cycle. It seems to be worse if you have left it switched off for over 24 hours.I downloaded the Sansa firmware updater and installed the latest firmware update (01.03.02A) but this has not fixed the problem. I have to say I am frustrated by these bugs which spoil an otherwise fine product. I am consequently returning this product to Amazon, and will continue to look elsewhere for a personal media player.

review/text: How I came to write this review:Having acquired a couple of new guitars in the past year, I decided to sell off a few of my older ones. One of these, a 1967-era Framus 6-string acoustic, I listed on our local Craig's List and heard from Etienne the same day. Within hours, we met at an outdoor mall near my home ( he told me I would be able to recognize him as he is told he resembles Jackson Browne - and he DOES!), where he tried (and played, to my delight, quite a bit) decided to buy the guitar and took it to his car. I gave him a break on the asking price and he gave me, in turn,a copy of this CD.Etienne is a musician, composer and performer. He has written the 15 tunes he performs on this CD and they run a broad range of musical genres from straight acoustic instrumental, to accompanied songs with his own vocals - some are of the 'classic' folk-type, one or two even mildly describable as 'protest' or 'opinion' songs - all smooth, well crafted and highly personal. I had never heard of him before this, but have listened to the CD many times in the past two months - liking it better each and every time.As a musician, his fretboard work is both clearly defined and delicate; as a singer, his voice is soothing, honest and yet humanly imperfect and as a composer and writer, his blend of old style with new and personal themes is outstanding. Amongst my most favorable comments is that this CD is NOT overproduced. Etienne actually coproduced it with Dan Prothero and their production touches are light- giving the total listening experience more the qualities of listening to a live performance in a small, intimate venue than that of a heavily engineered studio-produced and re-edited piece. This is definitely a guitar-centered album, and while it sounds as though there are other instruments on some of the pieces, no other performers are listed on the jacket - so I must infer that the other instrumental sounds are either synthesized or recorded by Etienne himself and then dubbed into the primary track. I simply don't know.For those of you interested in the specifics of the cuts, they are as follows:1. Meditation # C.O.B.2. Juniper Rosa3. The Lizard Song4. Providence5. Six Feet6. Big Black Wall7. There's Real and There's Moonshine8. Bama Bino Goodbye9. You Became A Knife10. Come Twilight11. Everybody Thinks You're A Smash12. Goodnight*** promo only solo tracks***13. Cerebro14. The Lizard Song15. Everybody Thinks You're A SmashThis is how I like it and probably why I am so taken with the CD as a whole. Having had some personal contact with the artist - I must admit - probably influences my relationship to the music.The CD can be found in the catalogue of Fog City Records, catalogue number FCCD 008.If you like your music honest, real and human - I think there is a good chance you will enjoy the work of Etienne de Rocher and this particular CD.

I then ask myself, I wonder whose tent she was &quot;tip-toeing&quot; to, with the &quot;sexy green underware&quot; she speaks of in her book.

review/text: Gods and Monsters is a work of fiction based on fact. James Whale was a great director at Universal that created the horror genre and most remembered for his films Frankenstein, Bride of Frankenstein, The Invisible Man and Show Boat with Irene Dunne. And he was openly gay.Ian McKellan plays Whale and Lynn Redgrave his devoted servant Hannah. In the film, they have added a character of Boone (Brenden Frasier). Boone is a gardener and cuts the lawn at Whale's estate. Boone also represents an alter ego of the Frankenstein monster (including a hair cut that resembles a flat top.)The film takes place during the final years of Whale's life. He has had a couple of minor strokes that disrupts his thought filters. Therefore, little things make is mind wander to other times. The film floats from the present to Whale's childhood to the filming of Bride of Frankenstein.Whale becomes infatuated with Boone, not sexually but as the personification of the his creature. He starts by drawing them, then he befriends him. Boone cannot understand this platonic relationship but accepts it. The film ends with Whale's drowning death.Ian McKellan and Lynn Redgrave give master classes in acting and both received Oscar nomination - both should have won. Brendan Frasier continues his dichotomy of performances, wonderful nuanced performance like this followed by mind numbing drivel (which, I guess, pays the bills.)DVD EXTRAS:Director CommentaryThe World of Gods and Monsters - A very well made 30 minute making of documentary featuring cast, director and guest commentary by director Clive Barker.

However, this book has to be one of the worst I've read in some time. I think the thing that got me the most was the dialog; unbelievably simplistic and totally formulaic. &quot;Damn, he said to Kate, &quot;It's the Hazar Scouts, &quot; Puhleeze! Not even an exclamation mark. Many other examples could be given. Now, assuming for the moment that the dialog was, say, written at greater than a 7th grade level, the plot is almost as bad. The protagonists' reactions to their fellows getting knocked off one-by-one is almost comic. There's no depth here; just one simple vignette after another.

This "I'm so alone and I love only what is unknown because it's so personal" view ignoring any potential mainstream act with real talent is so.......nevermind. If you are an interested customer, I would visit the web site, www.miauk.com/ and listen to a few tracks before deciding on the album. I'm not jumping in on any "hip" bandwagon with this record because I can honestly say that I'm constantly craving the beat that Maya moves too. Most dance records carry with it a short lifespan with a high burnout factor. Maya's sexy vocal flirtations moving to offbeat beats and noises with influences ranging from her homeland Sri Lanka, Jamaica, and IDM, is essential. Many records in this hip-hop/dance catagory carry with it filler. Not with this record 'cause every song holds it's own. Unfortunately, MIA falls in the crack between the pretentious indie snobs who snub dance as illegitimate and the preconditioned "I only like what's familiar to my ears" mainstream. I really hope America isn't so conditioned that they miss the boat altogether with this project much like what they did with The Streets.

review/text: A lot of readers seem to miss the point of this novel (especially the people who gave it 1 star, that's just weak). It's not about Orwell guessing what the world would be like in 1984 or really even a poke at communism. Orwell presents an exaggerated and seemingly impossible not-so-distant future to the reader and supports it magnificently with parallelisms to religion and ideology. He addresses whether freedom of the mind is intrinsic to the human conscience and whether or not free thought is necessary for human happiness. It also questions what is real or true. Does 2+2=5? If you believe it and everyone else believes it, than why in the hell wouldn't it be so. The novel left me more afraid of the masses and the susceptibility of the human mind than the government. The people can take back control at the drop of a hat and they are the ones who allow it to get out of control in the first place.

review/text: Fahrenheit 451 is a book about firemen burning books. The story is quite fascinating but the way Bradbury works it along is a little confusing. The storyline- Guy Montag is a fireman who burns books and is very proud of his job, that is until one day he meets a girl named Clarrisse and an old man. The story is basically what he decides to do in order to find out why books were banned and what is inside a book that leads people to love them or hate them. The confusing part of this book is that it leaves you thinking &quot;Ok, What just happened?&quot;. I recall that more than once I had to re-read a page 4 times and still couldn't figure out what happened. I'm guessing that the reason this book is so confusing is that it takes place in the future yet sometimes it seems so old (probably because it was written awhile ago). You sit there thinking &quot;Is this the real world (in the novel) or are they discussing the past, or are they discussing the future?&quot;. If you happen to watch the movie of Fahrenheit 451, watch it after you read the book, or better yet, don't watch it at all. The movie is different in many, many ways, including names and plot.

If you thought Transformers was good, and Transformers: Revenge of the fallen was just OK, then you are in the same boat I am, and you will be pleasantly surprised by Transformers: Dark of the Moon. If you hated them both, then you're not reading this.The visuals are, as has been the case with this iteration of Transformers, outstanding. The Blu-ray quality is a must in my opinion as the details in the action sequences are spectacular. I personally don't have a 3D television so I cannot comment on that feature, but, the video and audio quality made watching in high definition with an average sound system a very fun experience. The visuals are very clear, the colors look great, and all of the explosions rumble proudly.The story is, well, good enough. I wasn't watching for the story. I was watching for big robots and stuff blowing up. The story delivered that in large supply. If the goofiness of Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen turned you off, I can honestly say that it has been toned down here, and the action, not the dialogue, carries this film. You will have a much easier time believing that giant transforming robot aliens exist, than believing that Rosie Huntington Whiteley chooses to date an unemployed Shia LaBeouf however, when there is a billionaire "McDreamy" Patrick Dempsey knocking on the door.Overall, transforming robots look really cool blowing up a city, and that's what this disc is all about.

review/text: This is a collection of essays and op-ed pieces previously published in books, magazines, newspapers, etc.America is primarily the country of interest here, though other Western powers are related as well.That said, this is an excellent collection. Energetically all of Zinn's writings stem against the massive tides of bureaucracy, imperialism, racism, big business, atrocities, irony, patriotism and militarism. He adeptly argues against the hypocricy of the past and the present in what I felt to be anticipation of a truly just future. His ultimate point being the need "to achieve justice, with struggle, but without war."Most the writings are concerned with World War II and Vietnam, be it policies, battles or each wars place in history. WWI, Korea, Gulf War I, Kosovo and Yugolsalvia are also written about. As well, modern politics is engaged throughout and then illuminated in the final chapter, titled Beyond Machiavellianism which includes two expansive and frightening essays on U.S. Foreign Policy and the notion of a "just war" versus and "unjust war."This is a call to common sense, pacifism and equality. Zinn presents all of his arguments against a morality that speaks to accountability, responsibility, hope, truths and the imperative of the citizenry to inform themselves and not senselessly accept our leadership's habits or predelictions.A good introduction to Zinn.

review/text: Soul Jazz records latest release, 500% dynamite, concludes the dynamite dynasty so far.It has unfortunately fallen short of the rockin' standards that have been the key to success of the previous compilations.It's focus has turned towards a more modern dancehall ragga, that somehow isn't as melodic or liberating as previous ska, reggae, soul, and funk that compiles these albums.400% dynamite featured a few inclinations toward a ragga style content,with tunes such as Buju Banton's remix of &quot;ring the alarm&quot;.This is a top tune, with a ranging beat, of great originality and very stirring.Unlike the ragga that ranges on 500% dynamite, which lacks inherent jamaican soul.The majority of this compilation is ragga and i think this reflects the record label's desire to captivate music of a more modern era.Soul jazz records have perhaps reached the capacity of their music vaults, when it comes to the old, traditional music that made the dynamite series become &quot;dynamite&quot;, with soothing rocksteady, funky, soulful reggae and storming, hip-moving ska.Let's hope that the next album rediscovers its classical touch.When passion ignites: &quot;dynamite&quot;...Explodes!

review/text: This is just as good or even better that it predecessor, Jean de Florette (1986). It is amazing how well thought out the story is. Like a Greek tragedy, everything falls into place, everything is accounted for as fate conspires with character to bring about retribution for those who did wrong. We feel sad and sorry for Papet and Ugolin, whose weaknesses and "crimes" are so like our own.Daniel Auteuil, who plays Ugolin, is a actor with great range and sensitivity. He is unforgettable here as a not-too-bright peasant who suffers an excruciating and hopeless case of unrequited love. And Yves Montand, who plays his uncle is flawless, like an Olivier, as he experiences a very cruel turn of fate. Emmanuelle B&eacute;art, who plays Manon, is very beautiful, but she is also strange enough to be believable in an unlikely role as a solitary shepherdess of the hills of Provence.Claude Berri's direction is so perfectly paced, so full of attention to detail and so unobtrusive and natural that the film just seems to happen without effort. Nothing fancy, just show what needs to be seen, no more. Use no more words than necessary, but all that are necessary. It's almost like magic, how easy it looks. The scene near the end when the blind woman reveals the cruel turn of fate to Papet is exquisite in its simplicity and its effectiveness.In a sense this movie is a throw back an earlier era in cinema when careful attention to the construction of a character-driven story was the essence of the art.

review/text: I own the Austin Reed dartmouth blazer in every color in which they make it-- it is a staple of my business wardrobe. Well made, quality fabric, nicely tailored, classic lines, appropriate for a professional woman. (something that can be hard to find at times) It should be noted, however, that the periwinkle and raspberry colors are lovely, but the fabric and buttons are slightly different than the "classic" colors(lighter) and the linings and interfacings are not as substantial as the brown, navy, camel, red and ivory. It's still a good value, particularly as these are colors appropriate to warmer seasons and climates, but I was a bit surprised.

review/text: I bought this from Amazon in July. Unfortunately, I only opened it last week to find out it was a defective on the first disk. It played the first and third episodes perfectly but the second episode had 20 minutes of skipping. Amazon has absolutely no way of reporting this after your window of return has expired. So buyer beware. If you are slow to view your DVD's you can be screwed. I have always had good luck with Amazon until now.The series is excellent and quite intriguing until the end. I enjoyed it despite the skipping in the middle.

review/text: Who are the great post-War Wagner conductors? Knappertsbusch? Krauss? Solti? Karajan (if that's your taste)? Barenboim? Goodall? For the connoisseurs, perhaps, there's Kempe and Keilberth. Maybe even Jochum. But the list seldom includes Kubelik. Yet on disc there's a wonderfully conducted Lohengrin, let down by Gwyneth Jones on one of her squallier days, but enhanced by a beautiful Elsa from Janowitz. There's what is probably the best all round Meistersinger on disc which is again wonderfully conducted. And there's this Parsifal.This is Wagner conducting of the first order on practically all counts. First, orchestral balance. Kubelik is wonderfully sensitive to the combinations and colours of Wagner's score, inspired by the unique acoustic the composer had created at Bayreuth. To take just the Prelude, the balance between strings and clarinet, followed by the addition of the cor anglais in the opening theme is judged to perfection. Then the repeat of the same theme on the trumpet over pulsing 3+2 chords in the upper woodwind and arpeggio strings cuts through just as it should. Come the development section the addition of Horn 1 to Horn 3 at the top of the arch of that same melody enriches the texture perfectly. And so it goes on right through the opera.Then the pacing. Overall, Kubelik strikes a happy median between Knappertsbusch and Boulez. But he understand the ebb and flow of the piece so well, the mastery of what Wagner called `the Art of Transition'. So the profounder moments in the Grail Castle have all the space and air they need while much of Act 2 is taken at an urgent, exciting pace. Indeed, unlike most conductors, Kubelik seems to see the Second Act as the crux of the piece. (In this he goes along with Wieland Wagner whose graphic chart of the Parsifal Cross showing all the action radiating from the kiss is well worth investigating.) In retrospect, the whole opera under Kubelik seems to be one great, balanced arch with the Kiss as its keystone. And this is the most comprehensive and fulfilling performance of this Act that I know.Finally, Kubelik really brings out the modernity of the piece to the full. Harmonically, much of Parsifal and especially Act 3 mark a huge advance over anything in Tristan. And here you also have all those stark juxtapositions of the chromatic with the squarely diatonic (e.g. the Faith motif and the Dresden Amen theme). What I've never noticed before listening to this performance is how advanced it is rhythmically as well. So many of those chromatic themes and motifs involve syncopations and tied notes across bar-lines that totally do away with the tyranny of the bar. It is often as hard to tell where you are rhythmically as it is harmonically. Which, of course, is exactly what Wagner intendedThe singers, it has to be said, are not quite in the same league as their conductor. The outstanding performance here is Yvonne Minton's Kundry. One of the best `Ich sah das Kinds' I know; a very sexy, seductive lead into the kiss; true tragic angst as she recalls laughing at Christ; hair-raising and scary when she starts threatening. Her intonation is also wonderfully exact in all those creepy chromatic phrases, slipping up or down by semitone steps. Moll's performance is streets ahead of what he gave under Levine's lethargic direction, but he still can't quite stop Gurnemanz turning into a bit of a bore with his Act 1 narration in a way that a Weber or a Hotter always avoided. King is a sound Parsifal (as he is for Boulez) while never raising the hairs on the back of your neck as Vickers could at points like `Amfortas! Die Wunde!'. Weikl is good but not great. Mazura sings Klingsor's part most musically (no barking), but only Hermann Uhde seemed able to turn the character into something more than a pantomime villain. Salminen's Titurel is impressive but unremittingly forte. The Flowermaidens can be a bit shrill with the exception of the lovely Lucia Popp.The sound (from a Bavarian Radio recording of 1980) is not top flight by today's highest standards, but more than good enough to hear all of Kubelik's mastery of this score. And make no mistake. This is masterly conducting, well worth hearing.

review/text: C.S. Lewis' Mere Christianity is a great work about faith. Many intellectuals may scoff in contempt about some of the logic that Lewis uses, but in some ways that is the entire point of this book. He gives a concise and easily understandable description of what faith means. Keep in mind that this book is comprised of essays, many of which were born out of a radio program during World War 2.While Mere Christianity is a great read it should not be taken as the gospel truth. C.S. Lewis was a brilliant individual, but some of his beliefs about women in a religious perspective are outdated. He would be the first to tell you that he was nothing more than a layman when it comes to explaining the Kingdom of God. Qualms aside, this is a really great book and it is easy to read. Those that like Mere Christianity should read Lewis' The Screwtape Letters.

review/text: During my lifetime, I have always enjoyed playing video games and watching tv. I was a true couch potatoe, and barely left to go play with my friends. And the thing I hated most was reading. Any book, no matter how interesting, could't keep my attention, and didn't keep me reading. Language Arts was my least favorite class, becuase reading was so boaring at the time. When I moved to California ,I made a new friend named Tina. We both shared the intrest in video games, but she loved to read. Eventually, she told me about this book. I told her I loved cats, and read the prelouge. At first, I nodded it off, telling her that I'm not really into reading. But the next time I went over thier, I looked at the book again. It was like pulling me into it. It was the only book that caught my intrest. I kept reading, and pretty soon, it was the best book ever. It could make someone like Tina that hated cats before, love them. She even got 2 of them becuase of the books! When I was finished that book, my life changed. I started reading the rest of the series, and read the ones I've already read. When you read them, its like you're in another world. I, the one who hated books and never picked on up in my life, actually cried, laughed, and yelled positive and negative things about the characters in the book, like I was actually their. My language arts grade went up when I became one of the quickest and most observant readers in the class, and I even looked at my greenbelt, aware of the freedom it brings. This brought me outside, playing sports, and running around with friends. Every person that I suggest these books to read the first chapter, and can't stop! I assure you you will be satisfied, and even more! I read all kinds of books now, but nothing compares to the excitment, the saddness, and the love in Warriors: Into the Wild.BTW, I'm 13, so for all parents out their, my mother loves the books too. They're great for children, and their fall in love with the cats. But it's also great for teens and adults. Before hand, my mother would tell me something like, "Get off the couch, pick up a book, and read!" But now, my mom alwas says something like, "Get off the couch, put down the book, and go to bed!"

review/text: The Canterbury Tales is an entertaining romp through the Medieval English countryside. If you don't know what it's about, the Canterbury Tales is a collection of stories told by a group of pilgrims on their way to Canterbury Cathedral. The tales are told as a way to entertain each other on their journey and the one who tells the best tale will earn a fine meal paid for by the other travelers. This is actually an incomplete work as Chaucer died before completing it, but it is a fine example of early English literature and one of the most important pieces of the English Canon.The tales here vary in length and content as to the prologues and epilogues containing the goings on of the party members. Chaucer writes with a great sense of humor and, since he is writing in the language of the common folk, the content contains many lewd and bawdy jokes and events. It is a very entertaining read and if one wants more than just entertainment, there is a lot of social commentary about life in medieval England that can be gleaned throughout the text.I was a little unsure what to expect when I read this and don't be turned off by the introductory prologue in which our narrator introduces all of the characters. It can be a little long and dry in parts, but it helps to give a clear picture of the characters in the party as they interact with one another and tell their respective tales.Added note: I had to read this again for another class and this time we read it in the original Middle English. Having read the Canterbury Tales earlier, I appreciated the fact that I already had a handle on the general storyline of the tales and could instead concentrate on the nuances of the language and the beauty of the rhyme scheme. I thoroughly enjoyed this second time through the book.

review/text: This is a review for the ORIGINAL release of the book, not the reprinting...A majority of the writing seemed to be written by a child. Some stories aren't finished - on purpose - but its annoying, others are just down right silly. But then there are a couple "classic" stories, like famous urban legends that make up for some of those bad stories. In the end I'm disappointed in this book. I have such fond memories of it from my childhood, it's a shame I don't feel the same way about it anymore.For a more in depth review please visit my horror movie/book review blog in my profile

review/text: I recommend this film, but I think it could have been better. We need maps-- Where are the landmarks-- Red Barricades. Crossing 62. The Tractor Factory. The Brickworks. The only landmark we hear of in all three hours, other than the airstrips, is "the basement of a department store." Surely the script allowed for mention of the well-known landmarks. Viewers who have read a book on Stalingrad will feel lost.The narrator tells us that the airstrips are overrun-- then later we hear of Ju-52s landing at Pitomnik and Gumrak-- So after Kalach, there are other airstrips-- where are the maps that show what's going on? And how many times do we need to hear that the airstrips were chaotic? Seems like we heard that about every five minutes throughout the last two episodes. Was the story about the four officers in white fur coats believable?-- Forcing the pilot at gunpoint to leave the 17 wounded on the ground and take off with only the four officers? What goes through a pilot's mind at that point-- how about: "If they shoot me, how are they then going to get away?" Must we hear about this one flight, and not the thousands of others? I'm sure there were better examples than that, to make whatever point the directors were trying to make-- which seems to be that the Wehrmacht officer corps were all cowards.There are other good sources on Stalingrad. Read The Forsaken Army, by Heinrich Gerlach. See the 1993 German film 'Stalingrad' first. See Pekinpah's Cross of Iron, see The Winter War (Talvisota) 1989, directed by Parikka. Also Come and See (1989), directed by Klimov. Read Willi Heinrich. Read Heinrich B&ouml;ll. Read Barbarossa by Alan Clark. Read The Hinge of Fate by Winston Churchill. Read Anthony Beevor. Read The Road to Stalingrad by Benno Zieser.

review/text: I finished three-quarters of this entire book in less than a week; the first novel of the three in less than two days. That's how good "The Forsyte Saga" is. Galsworthy's writing style is incredible; it's no wonder that this is the novel that won him the Nobel Prize. The story and characters are so captivating that it just drives you onward and onward until the end. The Forsytes themselves are an intriguing lot--especially poor Soames. There's an instinct for the reader to dislike him, and yet Galsworthy shows that he has true human feelings, just like anyone else. His love for Irene and his passionate desire to be loved back is heartbreaking. The morals that Galsworthy incorporates makes the book complete, making it a true monument of literature.

review/text: In this whimsical, animated film, a lone unicorn seeks out others like herself through a mystical land of talking cats and spellbinding magicians. Based on the book by Peter S. Beagle, this story has enamored the hearts of fans - young and old - from around the globe. In her search for other unicorns, the last unicorn encounters a cast of delightful characters as well as dangers she never imagined. Throughout the fantastic adventure, she learns of friendship, love, and most importantly, her true self. Discover the magic that has kept this tale a treasured classic. Featuring the voices of Jeff Bridges, Mia Farrow and Angela Lansbury, the story brings forth the power of friendship, the beauty of love and the pain of regret. Interlaced with songs and ethereal imagery, The Last Unicorn will reignite the hearts of its fans and entrance all who enter.I decided to try this movie because my daughter currently loves unicorns. Her overall opinion was that the movie is "To long but great!" She had this to say as well, "I liked it because it was nice and had a unicorn and I love unicorns. My favorite part was the red bull. The worst part was when the witch died because she was old and mean." My husband really enjoyed the music to this movie. We agreed with my daughter, the movie is too long and is easy to lose interest in. I was shocked when I looked at the running time to see it is only 93 minutes. The movie felt much longer. Our least favorite part was in the beginning of the movie. About the time you first meet the unicorn you are also introduced to a rambling butterfly that you would really prefer to stop talking.On the technical side, the difference between the DVD and Blu-ray edition is so minor that to the untrained eye, or for most consumers, one would not recognize the Blu-ray disc from the DVD version. The quality of both disc are the same due to the movie being drawn rather than shot with high definition cameras. Quite frankly, it can only be so good. Both DVD's feature Schmendricks Magical Gallery and a mini documentary in the special features section. The DVD holds a game "Escape the Red Bull" for users to enjoy. The Blu-ray disc holds a commentary.The original movie was made in 1982 and is based off the well loved novel, The Last Unicorn by Peter S. Beagle. If you are a fan of this book or movie you'll love this upgraded version which holds the best quality the movie can boast with current technology. If you've never seen the movie, the story is unique and worth the watch. I would suggest renting it before you purchase this film as the story is one that will, most likely, interest current fans of The Last Unicorn rather than shake up a new fan base.Reviewed for BookPleasures (dot)(com)

review/text: The overall presentation of the Midway campaign is accurate but this movie was made on the cheap and it shows. The plight of Heston's son and his Japanese American girlfriend shows a real problem that existed but is poorly integrated into the plot.The real problem is the combat footage, almost all of which was stolen from elsewhere and stuck in with no sense of responsibility. First, don't use recognizable footage from one of the best WWII films made, Tora, Tora, Tora, especially using the very recognizable P40, an army plane not used at Midway, taking off against a mountainous background just after you've used a long shot showing that Midway was a flat atoll. Second, pay attention to what you just showed -- do not show a single seat fighter crashing just after you've shown the interior of a three seat plane getting shot up. Don't mix dive bombing (steep angle) and glide bombing (shallow angle)shots and do not!! show an extrior of the plane pulling out of a dive and then flip back to a studio shot showing the cockpit still pitched at a downward angle.Finally, the Yorktown was not hit by a kamikaze so don't use the footage of the USS Franklin getting hit late in the war.You don't have to be the type of military buff who can tell the different versions of a plane by small details to notice this kind of corner cutting. Instead of competing with Tora Tora Tora, the makers of Pearl Harbor should have remade this one.

review/text: Transformers: Dark of the Moon is a movie I regret having purchased. It is an empty, heartless film; to watch it is to devalue your life a little.Director Michael Bay has made only two good films: The Rock and Armageddon (the latter is a guilty pleasure of mine). His latest, this horrible (and third, if you can believe it) Transformers movie, is his worst film ever.Bay simply does not work well with CGI, and especially during action sequences. I am reminded of The Rock, and the expertly-directed car chase scene. The explosions, the shattered glass panes, and the upturned trolley were all practical effects. They were executed during the shooting of the film, not added in afterwards by an overpaid visual animation nerd.Bay's quick cutting works well in his aforementioned two other films. However, in this latest Transformers movie, the cuts provide only confusion and an unwelcome sense of unwieldiness.As for the acting, well, there is none. The good guys are all good and the bad guys all bad. I felt nothing but shame for serious actors like John Malkovich, Frances McDormand, and John Turturro. We all need a paycheck, but to stoop this low is reprehensible.The other characters--the main characters--are irrelevant. They basically yell and scream much of the time. Oh, and Shia LaBouf's character's girlfriend (Rosie Huntington-Whitely) sure is smoking hot.But there's no emotional connection between any of these characters. Bay's attempt at making me give a damn about "Bumblebee" or "Optimus Prime" fell flat, to say the very least. I do not have feelings for a car that turns into a giant, ugly warrior robot. Call me crazy.Transformers: Dark of the Moon amounts to 154 minutes of pure, unadulterated vapidity. Life is short, people; to waste two and a half hours of your existence on a film like this is a crime.

If you can't get over that, then frankly you don't deserve to hear it. The guitar effects will put you in a trance, and the songs flow together seamlessly. One of the reasons KOD didn't have mainstream success is their songs are some heavy duty songs about LOVE, both gutwrentching, and glorious.One of the top 10 CD's that changed my life.Just buy it.

review/text: Pancatantra the ancient book of fables, is an interesting collection of animal stories composed in India around the third century of the Christian era. It has been one of the first Indian classics to be translated into the western languages. Therefore these fables with their relevance to political, moral and religious life have become widely known and acclaimed. Patrick Olivelle the chair of the department of Asian Studies at the University of Texas in Austin, equipped with necessary expertise and familiarity with the subject matter and language, has translated these fables and rendered them in plain everyday language, though with all their complexities, for the sake of the American readers. The very informative introduction and extensive explanatory notes make the text fairly simple and easy to understand and relish. For those interested in the Indian classics, this storybook is a wonderful gift.

The transliteration is so weird that you actually have to learn two new languages before pronouncing anything closely right. I tried the book with several english speaking lao persons and lao speaking native english speakers while travelling around the country and all had problems with the transliteration. Nothing is like you would naturally pronounce it. For example who would say Khoj if you see Khawy?Helpful is the lao bit so you can point, in the end its how I got around. A pity, there are much better transliterations around.

review/text: William Golding does not leave readers with any thinking space to ponder of the values he brought up in the book. Unlike Harper Lee, whose novel requires a certain level of intelligence to interpret and understand, this novel spits out the themes directly, leaving no space for imagination. Even the symbols are so simple and uninteresting.This book has such a cynical and pessimistic view of the world, that i totally disagree with. I believe that no child would cause such destruction as this, and no child would be like he described, a incarnate of Satan.It is a book with his own thinking. It may be good if one understands and agrees with his way of thinking.I don't.

review/text: The plot of the book was very interesting and I think that it holds a special appeal for aspiring authors. However, parts of the book are extremely drawn out, and Wolfe feels the need to tell the reader every small detail about the character's life, without seeming to care whether it is of any significance to the reader. So although the plot is good and the character's well-developed, it is not fast-moving and I think that many people will become bored and restless through certain parts. However, if they keep reading it soon picks up again, and I feel that the book is worth reading even though it has this negative aspect about it.Another good thing about the book is that it does an excellent job of capturing the American spirit that persisted at the time it was written. During the novel the Great Depression takes place, as well as the beginning of World War II. The novel shows the social decay of this era and emptiness which envades American citizens' hearts when they realize that all the money they put so much worth in is nothingness now. If for nothing else one should read this book for an accurate picture of the time period in American history.Be aware of a lot of sexism and rascism throughout this novel, which shows the time period it was written in and hopefully shows us how far we have come- if not in reality, at least in the art of writing. I recommend this book for its plot and its setting, and if you like to read a book such as this and you don't only look for an on-the-edge-of-your-seat success story (and you can resist taking offense to some ugly comments), and especially if you are looking for a book that represents a time and a place very accurately, I think you will really like this book. It definitely has a great literary value and has stood the test of time in the hearts of many readers and lovers of literature.

review/text: Roman Polanski's 1968 "Rosemary's Baby" was his first American film debut. He had already directed a film based on another book by Ira Levin that starred French actress Catherine Deneuve. Ira Levin's novel was a best selling work of horror in the late sixties. The film, for the most part, is true to the book and it's very likely fans of Ira Levin's novel were satisfied with the film adaptation. Roman Polanski, Polish-born, was the right director for the film. His life story is tinged with loss and sorrow that could easily translate into cinema with biting cynicism and horror. A young Mia Farrow who might have been appearing in her film debut, plays the title heroine Rosemary Woodhouse and John Cassavetes plays her husband Guy Woodhouse. On DVD, this film, which may appear dated and even old fashioned to many modern horror fans, appears appropriately chilling and eerie, especially for its use of subtlety which is lost in the wake of today's horror. The musical score is jazz-like but dramatic and scary. The New York City atmosphere, the 60's milieu and the credible and convincing performances by all the actors makes this novel extremely haunting and intense, even if there is no blood or gore. The real meat of this film is that the horror is invisible, it's simply there, acting as normally as the normal-behaving people. The most profound fears of human imagination, the Devil, is a danger and horror not outside but inside- as close to home as possible- inside Rosemary's womb. The ending seems to be also the climax. Rosemary finally realizes that the baby she gave birth to is the son of Satan, the Anti-Christ and though she is horrified, her mother's love and the experience of having carried him through pregnancy, in short, her maternal instincts, is to care for the child after all. She rocks the black cradle over which an upside crucifix hangs and decides to "mother" the monster.Guy and Rosemary Woodhouse move into an old apartment complex in New York City (the location was shot in the same area where John Lennon was shot and killed. The owners of the apartment are an elderly couple who give off eccentric vibes. A young woman who was living in the apartment commits suicide by throwing herself out the window (she had been the first woman the Satanic couple wanted to give birth to the Devi's baby). The old apartment has been the sight of many frightening going-ons, including murders and satanic rituals. The old couple decide they want Rosemary to have the Devil's child. They make a deal with Guy, who aspires to be a famous and wealthy actor. Guy will have his fame and fortune but in return his wife Rosemary must have the Devil's child. After being drugged by a dessert, Rosemary falls into a comma-like sleep in which she dreams she is on a boat with leisurely passangers, including John F. Kennedy and Jackie Kennedy, the Presidential couple. With her being numb, she is unaware that the evil couple have conjured up Satan to impregnate her. Later, when she is pregnant, she is given strange concoctions to make sure the baby will be born healthily and she is taken to a doctor who also happens to be in on the cult. Rosemary is pale and anorexic-looking and realizes something is wrong.The pregnancy is the slow build up to the dark finale. Rosemary has not quite grasped the true situation. Also, through the dialogue and the behavior of the people around her, the film seems to want to trick you into thinking that Rosemary is merely hysterical and imagining things as a result of a complicated pregnancy. But we know well that she is not. Finally, she does become aware that the neighboors are witches and devil worshippers and that she and her baby are in danger, thanks mostly in part by a book and anagram puzzle that a friend provided after his death. Although she tries to escape, she is trapped in the apartment and gives birth to the baby with the assistance of the witches. She is frightened in the finale to realize that she has indeed delivered the Anti-Christ into the world.For Roman Polanski, this 1968 film proved to be ironically true. About a year later, his wife Sharon Tate was brutally killed. Sharon Tate was pregnant with Polanki's baby at the time. The Marilyn Manson cult seem to parallel the coven in the movie. Roman Polanski's parents had also died in Nazi concentration camps. This film seemed suited for him to direct because of it's dark message- that evil is triumphant and that God is dead, the very essence of fear. It is a film that tame as it is, can really scare you and get under you're skin. This haunting film inspired other cinematic horror legends which would become famous in the next decade of the 70's- The Exorcist and the Omen Series. The film won best screenplay adaptation from a novel and Ruth Gordon as Best Supporting Actress.

review/text: This movie starts out with lots of violent action but no blood. From the start you know you are seeing a video that is like a grade B movie but you keep on watching. Dennis Weaver as Buck is a delightful character and endearing. However there is a lot of Characters and keeping them all straight good guys versus bad guy doesn't take much time, just following the progression of death. Good car chase, good explosions, lots of action but just slightly off balance to be a real quality movie.

review/text: I bought this printer about a month ago and was slightly disappointed by its performance. The print quality is great, the photos I printed looked 99% like the 35mm prints that came from the lab, but I made the mistake of using 4x6 photo paper instead of the standard 8 1/2 x 11 sheets. Approximately every-other print came out crooked on the paper, and the printer has an annoying habit of cutting off the last inch of the image because of margin restrictions. I couldn't find an option to use the maximum paper margins, and so had to end up making a white border around the image so that the printout didn't look strange.I bought this printer as a replacement for a 5-year-old Epson brand, and am considering going back to it because of my frustrations with this HP. Summary: Great print quality and speed, but not good with custom paper sizes.

review/text: Flat out, I bought this record because I heard &quot;Train, Train&quot; on an NPR Bluegrass show and literally had to pull over to the side of the road and listen to Sam Bush's mandolin playing. To my ears, he virtually reinvents the instrument, or at the very least brings it into the 21st century. The range of emotion he conveys through his virtuoso playing is incredible. He probably has the greatest technical mastery of the instrument of any player today. It turned out that this song, and indeed the playing in general, is just icing on a very wonderful cake. Dolly is here, in full-throated glory, belting originals, contemporaries and ancients as if they just always belonged together. Free from comercial concerns, Dolly returns to the roots of her craft and comes away with an album that is at once a brilliant showcase for her stunning range and expressiveness and a truly groundbreaking bluegrass album.

review/text: The original transformers were meant to be a two sided commodity, to be so one half would be a cartoon and the other an action figure line. The cartoon, to be successful would have to be accepted by kids and their parents. To please children it contained action, cars, and a variety of characters, some silly some serious. To please parents the shows would have a passing moral and a code of conduct. In the first animated Transformers movie that code changed and Optimus Prime died.As I skimmed this movie I was treated to a world of unrealistic fantasy. There seemed to be some fun points, but overall this was a silly movie that crammed together pop icons, more story than was really useful, unbelievable relationships and situations (this is with suspension of disbelief at level 11) and a complete lack of any moral. In fact, when the final battle came to a conclusion it was the hero of the Autobots who took it into his own hands to brutally kill his two foes. The only good thing about this ending is that those foes would be necessary for a sequel. Optimus Prime and the entire cast of characters are all very much adult, all very much amoral when it comes to the enemies they face and the enemies the Autobots face are of course very amoral themselves.So it comes down to a question of who cares. Who cares if the main human character has trouble finding a job, his girlfriend is smoking hot (but didn't she have black hair at some point?). Who cares if the Earth is threatened, we know it isn't going to be destroyed anyway. Who cares about the Autobots, they are friendly to humans, but they are just as violent as the Deceptocons when you get down to it. Who cares about the humans, they are a bumbling mess. Who cares about those two ity bity Autobots? Wait, I did, I actually thought their deaths (if they did die) were quite heroic.So that is that, the stakes were low, my investment was low, and this movie, though a commercial success will surely go on the list of rarely watched movies from the teens because it truly sucks.

review/text: The only reason I came across this film was that I was mesmerized by the director's more recent work, the Perfume. So I thought I'd check out the rest of his films.Lola gets a call from her boyfriend that he's lost his crime boss' money. And the boss is coming to collect it in 20 minutes. So Lola starts running, originally to see her dad who is a banker. And then depending on how fast she can go or whether she gets held up or not, entire lives can work out differently not only for herself but also for people that she bumps into - literally. The movie shows us 3 possible scenarios.The action's obviously quite fast, because she's running just about the whole movie, so you are made to feel that things are happening. But it's all extremely shallow, the thrills and developments are very uninteresting.We are shown fates of people we do not care about at all. This is one of the main flaws of this film. It assumes that the audience will care about strangers. The only guy I cared about in the movie was the homeless fellow, I looove that beard. Even Lola and her boyfriend didn't really move me, though they looked like a lovely couple.The message of the film is also very much irrelevant. That the little choices we make, or even just pure chance, can have big effects on our lives and others'. No kidding! Give this guy a Nobel Prize! But I have a question: So what??? You go about your life doing things the way you see fit. There's no place for what ifs and what would have happened if my dad had chosen my aunt instead of my mum? Irrelevant.The annoying thumping music adds insult to injury, it is very poor, something you would expect at a brain numbing nightclub just to keep you awake.All in all, it's an interesting enough film, if only cos you are curious how it will end but apart from Lola's and the homeless dude's hair there's not much there to really care for or remember. 5 out of 10.

review/text: Ugh. Let me start this off by saying I'm an RABID horror fan and have been for over 20 years - I love ALL types of movies, from the classics to the painfully dull bargain bin selections. I knew when this one came out in theaters, to stay FAR AWAY and not waste my money on the price of admission. A year or so later, I finally caught it on cable and figured, &quot;Oh, why not, I'll watch it.&quot; Bad choice - I lost just about 2 hours of precious time I could have spent picking out bellybutton lint or cleaning my cat's litterbox. I'm trying to locate a copy of the book, so I can read it again and see just how badly this Shirley Jackson story was ruined, as my memory of the original is quite fuzzy. All I know is that she must be rolling around in her grave, waiting for a chance to get her hands around the director's neck.What a steaming pile this movie is... since when did using CGI become the only way to get &quot;scares&quot; out of the audience? I miss the horror of the 80s, 70s, 60s and so on... back then, people actually had relatively fresh ideas (in most cases) and could execute them in a creative way. Could you imagine if the Exorcist had been done today, by someone fond of CGI? The actors wouldn't have had to spend grueling hours in a freezing cold room, with REAL breath rising like steam from their lips - the director could have had the breath drawn in digitally, like in THIS stinker, and the effect would have been absolutely ruined.Bah... ugly moaning cherubs (Same moans used over and over too! Tacky!), horrible cliches, huge old guys and a monstrously large mansion you just KNOW nobody's lived in - this movie blows. I'm gonna go watch the ORIGINAL movie from the 60's now, and I suggest you do the same. Avoid this movie... it's a serious waste of perfectly good time AND money if you rent it.

review/text: Despite the fact that my initial interest in this DVD was the opportunity to see Patsy Kensit, I actually found Jurgen Prochnow and Elizabeth Hurley to be far more entertaining as (respectfully) the skipper of a private yacht and a passenger desperately trying to reach the Bahama's.Although her role is pivotal to the plot, Kensit plays her part as a whiney, insecure sidekick to Hurley's. Her character really only seems to serve as a catalyst to engender a bond between Prochnow's skipper and Hurley's flamboyant passenger in addition to adding some sense of reason to a twist at the end that has me still scratching my head.This movie was marketed as another trip into "Deep Calm" waters but in actual fact the expected confrontation that the movie seems to be inevitably steering towards never occurs, this probably greatly contributed to the lackluster performance of the movie but for me the picture took more interesting turns into examining some really warped human behavior and building distrust between the three people stuck on a small boat together for four weeks.Prochnow plays a washed out sailor who, after a tragic event at sea, has not had the courage to leave port for months. Following an intoxicated meeting with two female entertainers (Kensit and Hurley) he subsequently finds out that he has agreed to take the two carefree women on a four week sail to the Bahama's.What follows is a roller coaster of human emotion, suspense, sex (nudity from Hurley) and confusion. The movie however never seems to find its niche though and its twist is underwhelming and unsatisfying. So much more should have been delivered, especially with such an attractive cast, but the screen time and talent seems wasted.Perhaps this is the reason this movie has been marketed under so many titles. Its original German title was `Der Skipper', but its also been named `The Storm.'

review/text: It took the first three volumes of his Martian series for Edgar Rice Burroughs to get his hero John Carter, former cavalier of Virginia, and Dejah Thoris, princess of Helium to the point where they could live happily ever after. Satisfied with the combination of romance and pulp adventure, this fourth Martian novel turns to the next generation of Barsoomians. Cathoris, son of the Warlord of Mars and his beloved princess, is one of two princes and a Jeddak who are seeking the hand of the Thuvia of Ptarth. When she is kidnapped by the sinister Prince Astok of Dusar, the entire planet is about to be thrown into a bloody war and Cathoris has to follow in his father's footstep and deal with savage beasts and phantom armies as he rescues Thuvia and saves Barsoom from a costly war. Of course, by the time he catches up with his beloved, Cathoris finds the situation is slightly more complicated than he thought, mainly because ERB never provides a smooth ending for his couples."Thuvia, Maid of Mars" was originally serialized in "All-Story Weekly" in April 1916, which explains the novel's subtext about world war, since one was going on in Europe at that point in time. The original title was "Cathoris," but apparently when it was published as a novel in 1920 somebody wised up and changed it. Thuvia is not as great a name as Deja Thoris, but it is not bad. In many ways this is like the previous novel, "The Warlord of Mars," where the hero chases his beloved across the landscape of Barsoom and has to deal with green men and white apes. Fortunately, unlike ERB's Tarzan series, "Thuvia, Maid of Mars" is really the only time that repeats himself like this in the Martian series, which stands out as his best as he proves in the next and most inventive volume in the series, "Chessmen of Mars."

review/text: Depending on who you are, there are different messages provided in this book. To a reader in the 50's, this book may just seem like a chilling, futuristic novel. More can be seen by the modern reader because the actual science fiction portion of the book is less distracting. All of the devices described in the book we either already have, or now know are impossible to create within this new century. For example, the interactive &quot;family&quot; Millie was so involved in could be around any day now to consume our loved ones. The mechanical hound, on the other hand, won't be. When the creativity and dazzling ideas of the &quot;future&quot; are lost, the morals and messages become more defined. Bradbury was probably more accurate than he would have ever thought, as we move towards a more lazy America. Some of these messages seem more religious then anything else. They inspire to take advantage of the moment, and be thankful for what we have been provided. No matter how advanced we become, nothing will replace picnics and family values. Although these things have deteriorated over time thanks to technology, they should always be practiced if only for tradition

review/text: Hailed by many as M&aacute;rquez's finest literary work, One Hundred Years of Solitude tells the story of the Buend&iacute;a family, who live and work in the South American jungle. M&aacute;rquez unites great wit and comic timing with philosophy to produce the extraordinary book, and the combination of fantasy, magic and reality makes for enthralling reading.Laughter and tragedy, love and death are all bound together by Garcia's unique writing style. There is exploration and adventure, but always with a slight tinge of sadness and nostalgia. M&aacute;rquez brings you into the Buend&iacute;a family and lets you experience their joys and triumphs, failures and disappointments at first hand. You experience life through their eyes, and become intimately acquainted with their fears, hopes and dreams.In 1982 M&aacute;rquez was awarded the Nobel Prize for Literature, and his other works include Love in the time of the Cholera and Of Love and Other Demons, as well as several short story collections. In all his books he invokes real emotion from the reader, and One Hundred Years of Solitude is no different. Whilst reading this book you are sent into an almost trance-like state, and become completely enveloped in the story. Fantasy and reality are intertwined so closely that it becomes impossible to tell the difference. M&aacute;rquez also explores the notion of time, as the later generations in Macondo repeat the experiences of the first generations. The names people receive are also relevant-for example all 17 Aurelianos are articulate, solitary men, and all Jose Arcadios are enterprising and energetic.This is a challenging read-I found myself turning to the front page to look at the family tree many times. However, this is an excellent book, destined to become a classic. An unmissable read, by perhaps the greatest author of our times.

review/text: The Third Secret follows the typical suspense/thriller model. It is adequately interesting to keep one reading. The early pages filled with interesting bits of information about the Vatican's history. However, (And I won't give away the secret) at about page 350, the book takes a dive. Steve Berry apparently thinks that no one will object when he shoves in his personal views on divisive church issues. But whether you agree with him or not, the revelation is completely unwarranted. I suppose Berry was trying to set his religious thriller in the same vein as Dan Brown's "heretical" books. In the end the book devolves into a treastise of Berry's personal views, presented in a way that debate is impossible. That added to the absolutely deplorable behavior by the story's protagonists (which Berry makes no attempt to challenge) makes this book a disappointing read at best.

review/text: "The first WWI aviation film in 40 years", so director Tony Bill reported gloats in a recent interview. Actually, "30" would present a more accurate figure, considering the 1976 release of the JAck Gold's "Aces High", but no bother. I needn't fret about Bill's lack of affinity for cinematic history; his readily apparent ineptitude in both the historical and technical departments is bad enough.Talk about ineptitude (among other things), this supposed homage to an actual WWI squadron perpetuates just about every conceivable clich&eacute; imaginable, furthermore effectively stealing elements from nearly every aviation flick ever devised, including Blue Max, the Dawn Patrol, Dark Blue World, the Tuskegee Airmen, and even that age-old silent flick from 1927, WINGS. Furtherome, the battle scenes themselves reflect the most cheesy elements of propaganda war flicks, culminating in the endless ranks of snarling villains, the cheering crowds on the ground below as our heroes intercept the strafing Huns to save the day, and even a veritable race against the proverbial clock to destroy a German airship before it supposedly "obliterates" the entirety of Paris.And as of the various manners in which this film blatantly exhibits its readily apparent lack of prowess for historical and technical accuracies, let me count the ways.For starters, let's consider the countless manners in which the on-screen aircraft repeatedly defy the laws physics. Admittedly, some reviewers have pointed out Tony Bill's part-time profession as an aerobatic pilot, which in essence appears to compromised his interpretations of World War I combat, as he seems to have derived his perception of first world war fighters from having logged too many hours in Pitts Special as opposed to having derived genuine insight into the performance capabilities and limitations of such elaborate contusions of fabric and wood. For one thing, the aircraft exhibit speeds twice in excess that of the actual performance capabilities of World War I aircraft, culminating in a host of physical implausibilities as overly efficient climbing characteristics as if instigated in the absence of a stall barrier, low-level maneuvers that would have invariably either stalled the aircraft or resulted in considerable wing shear, not to mention that these biplanes and Triplanes exhibit phenomenal roll-rates which no multi-winged aircraft on the planet could possibly emulate. Evidently, Tony Bill exhibits an accurate conception of three dimensional space, but not of the actual performance characteristics of First World War-era fighters.Furthermore, the movie's glaring affinity for historical inaccuracy reflects the presence of numerous aircraft that never existed during the Escardrille's 1916 escapades, including the SE.5, Handley Page 400, Gotha IV, and of course the Fokker Dr. 1 Triplane, which brings me to another issue that drives me out of my mind, culminating in one of the most trivial misinterpretations about World War I aviation. Bottom line, the above depiction stems from a trivial and widespread popular misconception that by default associates World War One German aircraft with countless formations of red-coated Triplanes, as if the Germans had somehow managed to perpetuate endless clones of Von Richtofen, to say nothing about the fact that the Fokker Dr. 1 was ultimately produced in insignificant numbers, culminating in an actual production run of only 160 examples.In fact, the Lafayette Escabdrille fought the majority of its pitched-battles against outmoded Fokker E.III Eindeckers and two-seat Albatross and Aviatik observation scouts, the superior equipment of the Amercans frequently offset by their readily apparent lack of experience.And another thing, the average life expectancy of a World War I pilot is actually confined to the space of a single week, unlike the film's more optimistic projection of 3 to 6. Furthermore, somebody should remind the screenwriters never to emphasizes the virtues of German aircraft by citing the presence of all powerful engines, as the rates of horsepower which the Germans managed to conceive lagged considerably behind that of their allied counterparts.Furthermore, pilots were indeed NOT permitted to instill their own personal insignias, considering that, unlike World War II, rarely were aircrew assigned individual aircraft, often dispersing their ranks among the types available in a manner that typically resulted sharing planes out amongst each other. Furthermore, as blatantly misrepresnted by the closing scene, there is simply no such thing as rejoining one's formation in the event of finalizing an aerial skirmish, as aircraft frequently fought pitched battles at length, scattering miles away from each other, thus relaying each pilot with the burden of utilizing landmarks and navigations skills as the sole means for finding their way home on an individual basis.Reverting to the film's one and only redeeming feature, the various aspects in which the Flyboys attempts to model battle damage in conjunction with the various behaviors of shedding wings and burning engines bear a more accurate depiction than the remainder of the film. However, given the all too elaborate staging of such sequences through an over use of Green Screen techninques in conjunction with an overabundance of CGI effectively renders the overall appearance as reminiscent of, as one reviewer stated "playing a really cool video game" as opposed to providing a genuine "in the cockpit" sensation for the expreiences of piloting such frail machinations.Most offensive, however, is the gratuitous manner in which the movie concocts the entire spectacle within a fanciful dressing of glamour, all the while pedaling it's pretensions for historical and physical accuracy.In all fairness, perhaps I should lend Tony Bill an additional bone by citing the best moment of the entire movie, in which the guts of that blabbering Christian fanatic splatters the entirety of his instrument panel (the only moment in the entire film in which I cheered).Ultimately, the inclusion of a photograph of the actual members of the Lafayette Escadrille seems like a cruel joke, as if the preceding spectacle of cartoonish escapism somehow culminates in an authentic tribute to the squadron in question.Considering the shear sparsity of world war one related aviation flicks, it doesn't take a genius to brand this endeavor as by far the worst ever conceived.For more informative and productive viewing, I can recommend virtually every other aviation flick on the market, from the veritable classics like "Blue Max" and "Aces High" , to some of the more lukewarm efforts of "Ace of Aces" and "Von Richtofen and Brown".

The book was of utmost importance to me in this case, as it is, as far as I know, the only book covering this topic on such a high level of quality at the moment. Further research also revealed to me, that the momentary german policy is utmost abysmal, and that, surprisingly, the German Green Party, B&uuml;ndnis 90/ Die Gr&uuml;nen, would maintain the best policy in case of election (just for your information).

review/text: The book is written about an empire in the future. I'm not really sure why Asimov thought that the future galaxy would be ruled by an emporer, which is a dying system of government, instead of a democratic republic. I know this is nit-picking, but I didn't like this book.Apparently, the future can be predicted with a high degree of accuracy using math and statistics. Anyone who works as a mathematician or statistician, as I do, knows that it's difficult to predict what's going to happen in anyone's life tomorrow, much less the entire world 500 to 1000 years into the future using statistics.This book is intellectual worship, which is something I can't stand. Intellectual worship is when people think they are intellecually superior to everyone else, so feel they should rule over everyone else, if only you would listen to them. This idea drips off the page as event after event is predicted by some really smart dude. This smart dude predicted a collapse of civilization and treated it as inevitable. Another idea that's patently absurd- that any event that occurs is inevitable.If this guy was so smart as to predict, with a high degree of accuracy, the downfall of civilization, and the rising of a new one, along with the traumatic events this new civilization would go through, why wasn't he smart enough to avert the downfall of the original civilization. Surely, with his predictive ability people would listen to him, but he decides to let it crumble for whatever reason.And Asimov is a mediocre writer. The story is only moderately interesting because no character really gets developed. I read this book because as a sci-fi fan, I felt obligated.

review/text: This book is a fine introduction to how economic theory can dictate policies that promote the economic well being of society. The focus of the book is "The Law of Unintended Consequences", and the author brings in countless examples of how well meaning policies, such as price ceilings, rent control, etc have led to disastrous results.In giving it 4 stars instead of 5, I'd like to point out some concerns.1) The book, while a classic, is somewhat dated. The ideas are still pertinent, but many examples are not as relevant today.2) I'm afraid that reading Naked Economics first spoiled me a bit. This book lacked the humor and pep that kept me engrossed in the former.3) Most importantly, the book is strictly about economics, and is too simplistic in some ways. It fails to incorporate the complex real world political dynamics that determine policy. Today, most congressmen are sold on the benefits of free trade. But the barriers to economic growth are more nuanced in the real world.Some will argue that this was not the focus of the book, and they are correct. Still, I fear that a reader will latch onto Hazlitt's ideas as a panacea, and fail to appreciate that in a world where "Keeping up with the Joneses" is as important, if not more important, than how much wealth one has, that policy decisions are more complex that the author would have us believe.

review/text: If you've driven an hour to hear Ed Goldstein and Buddy Wachter, suffered through an interminable opening act to hear Jonathan Dorn and Leon Redbone, lamented that you've worn out the grooves your Howard Johnson and Taj Mahal &quot;Real Thing&quot; album, and purchased all of the recordings of Sam Pilafian and Frank Vignola, why, then, this is your genre. It's just plain fun--it makes you want to go make friends with a banjo player. The next best thing to having Eli Newberger, Butch Thompson and Jimmy Mazzy on your porch this summer would be to sit out there yourself with your boom box, your old rocking chair, a glass of iced tea, and this CD. The title of this recording is the same as that of a book by Newberger on the development of male character (Perseus, 1999). In the liner notes, Newberger cites a previous concert series &quot;Themes of Intimacy and Aggression,&quot; as using much of the same material as this recording, but one could simply characterize the men providing inspiration for these selections as &quot;bad guys and good guys,&quot; from &quot;Big Bad Bill,&quot; to being &quot;Wild About Harry.&quot; I can almost believe Jimmy Mazzy when he sings that he &quot;Ain't Misbehavin'.&quot;

review/text: Donal Cline clearly demonstrates his inability to distinguish fact from fiction. I find his book to be biased (towards the Murphy-Dolan faction), poorly researched (claiming that Billy the Kid was known as Michael McCarty), and his findings to be very questionable (presents evidence without veryfiable sources.)After reading this book I asked myself why did Cline write this book? He seems to not think to much of &quot;Billy the Kid&quot; so why write a book about him? Why not stick to your true passion and write a documentary about James Dolan and L.G. Murphy.

review/text: Written over sixty years ago, time has not diminished the capacity of this book to capture the reader's heart. This coming of age story that takes place in turn of the century Brooklyn will simply enthrall the reader with its descriptive passages and its richly developed characters. This book survives the passage of time without becoming anachronistic, because the themes upon which it touches are universal ones.The story centers on the Nolan family. The central character is the daughter, Mary Frances Nolan. Known as "Francie" to all and sundry, she is an intelligent child growing up in poverty in the tenements of Brooklyn with her charming father, a singing waiter and an alcoholic, her hard-working and practical, no-nonsense mother, and her younger brother, who enjoys favored son status in his mother's heart. Surrounding the family are a host of characters that are richly drawn and serve to add to the ambiance of the story as it enfolds.The events that transpire in the book are seen through Francie's eyes. Her family's struggle with poverty, her father's alcoholism, her mother's steely-eyed determination to keep her family afloat, and Francie's thirst for knowledge and desire for higher education all serve to make this child strong and thrive, where others might only despair. Such is Francie's strength of character. It is that strength that helps her to battle her self-doubts, her loneliness, and lack of friends, while growing up.This is a beautifully rendered story, a true American classic that will keep the reader turning its pages.

review/text: Although the reason I did not like the Hi-tech altitude IVs are subjective, I will at least explain why i didn't like them.First off, there are a bit big and bulky. No so much heavy as just get in your way. I didn't feel like I could have very good freedom of movement in them.they were comfortable, and felt good in terms of cushioning the sole of my foot. it's not so much soft as much as it is slightly sloped on the medial and lateral sides of the heel the form more of a cradle for the posterior of the foot. most of this cradling is provided by the inserted sockliner.three things I was especially disappointed with were the heel height (very high, felt like you were wearing a cowboy boot), stiff forefoot toe-up bend that made walking feel more like rocking on a semicircle plate rather that the shoe actually flexing and an unnatural overlay under the left big toe beneath the sockliner.When i think about it, it does walk and resemble a cowboy boot sole form (not tread but actual sole plate shape) and heel height. comparing them to a walking shoe, sport shoe or even a timberland boot which i compared to these, the forefoot did have much more "rock" to it, which i thought felt weird. for instance, the timberland boots' toe lays flat on the ground. in this shoe, the toe will be slightly elevated off the ground. and the toe box is not very flexible to allow for the more common flattening.The unnatural and bulge under the toe could not have been normal. likely a factory defect of some type that passed unnoticed through quality control. it was not only distracting (i have a pet peeve about symmetry- each side should feel the same and equally balanced) but it was painful after a few minutes of walking if you push off your toes at all.from above, i thought the shoe was ugly, which is important to me because that is the part of the shoe you, the wearer, see most. the leather shows markings easily. and i thought the top around the ankle fit either too loose or too tight, depending on how you lace it.I do not know about it's waterproofing ability; I did not wear it in wet conditions. insulation to cold is average to below average. it felt about 1/2 size too small.if you are looking for a design like this, with a higher rise and similar stying, it was fairly comfortable. I do not believe the overlay bulge under the toe would be a problem with other shoes of this make and model, just an isolated incident.Amazon shipping was fast and excellent. i enrolled in Amazon Prime free because I am a college student and got 1-day shipping for $3.99. great deal.just didn't like them. not for me. in the process of returning them now. hope this helps.

It was like the staged MTV &quot;real world&quot; shows... Adults are stupid.... You can survive being dewey eyed in NYC? GAG! When the heroine opened her mouth the first time, my GF and I both cringed at her voice. Her name needed to be &quot;Bambi&quot;. Then there was the hapless daddy. Then there was everything else. About the time the heroine and hero are doing the teen aged ga-ga thing and uttering mind numbing trivia to each other, and my GF is making motions like she is going to heave into her popcorn, I glanced over at the row of teenaged girls next to us - they were enraptured!As I said.... Great film if you're under 16 !Unlike one of the other reviewers who noted all the idiocy going on in the bar (like the overpouring which is both illegal and irresponsible), I will dismiss this as aimed directly at a teenaged audience without a shred of real world experience (I owned a large bar and saloon), and thus literary license.I gave it ONE star for TWO reasons: The first is ... rate it with negative stars..... and the second is that there was some genuine stompin' music.... Interrupted only occasionally by the shrill screeching of the heroine and the other mindless dialog.

I didn't really miss Megan Fox, but the new girl didn't add to much to the movie either. The action was very good as were the scenes, but I felt they could have shaved at least 30 minutes off the movie and still came out with the same results. I did think the beginning of the movie was more interesting than the end.

review/text: There is nothing bad I can say about Fela, there really isn't. The man was a cultural and political phenomenon inspiring countless amounts of fellow Africans to take a stand. Think in the terms of Bob Marley, but do I dare to say Fela was more important? Uh, yes. (Meanwhile, I just made the entire faux post-hippie movement choke on their bong smoke)."Music Is The Weapon" prooves to be the perfect title for Fela's 'best of' songs. He fought soley with art and became so powerful at it that he opened and performed religiously at his own night club, using it as a politcal pulpit. After gaining international acclaim, Fela was eventually gunned down after a concert so he could be kept quiet, only to survive and continue his fight. Parallels could be noted about Marley, however, Nigeria had more urgent problems than Jamaica.Fela was a versatile musican, not only did he sing and write his own compositions, he played keyboards and saxaphone while directing his band and singers. Many people compare him as Africa's James Brown because the music uncontestedly FUNKY. It is a fair agreement. JB is the Godfather of Soul and Fela is the Godfather of Afrobeat, although Fela is much active in his human rights awareness. And smarter, seeing that James Brown endorsed Richard Nixon.In whole, this collection is a great starting point for getting into this truely one-of-a-kind artist. It acts as a 'greatest hits' despite the two problems I have with this release:1- It does not highlight the broad range of music and time eras Fela recorded in, but remember, the music selections are by no means poor examples of greatness and originality.2- Many of the track selections are only parts or edits of the full-length versions, but keep in mind that some of these 'edited' versions are still 8-14 minutes long. If they were not cut, we would be looking at half an hour jams right up there with electric Miles Davis funkiness."Music Is The Weapon" also contains a third disc that documents Fela's musical life and political beliefs on DVD while displaying live performances and interviews with the man himself. Fela's mission was to make you aware while making you dance, both in a gracefully artistic manner.I suggest researching the life of Fela. In turn, the music will make more sense to us living in western society.

This book had laughs but was so much more. I loved the relationships between the characters. For a change there was actually a hero and herione who did not make me shake my head in disgust. They acted like real people. The secondary characters, Tom and Susannah were well thought out and very realistic. And you just gotta love Pearl! There were several belly laughs as well, particularly the hospital waiting room scene. I laughed so hard my husband starting looking at me strangely.

review/text: The foundation is setup to secretly monitor mankind through its darkest hours. It reminded me a little of Orwell's 1984. In placing humans away from the central government on a planet with few resources. They are forced to develop quickly. This is a novel more about political machinations than about action. The contradictions in human nature are here to analyze. The characters use guile, spirit, & cunning to survive. Some 80% of the book is dialogue & the character development is a bit shallow. Nonetheless, Mr. Asimov portrays the future in poignant & diverse ways. The predicted conflict makes the story of galactic history entertaining, especially since this was written in 1951. Some 7 years before Sputnik was launched. The author deserves praise for his imagination that was well ahead of his time.

Constantine is not a movie I expected to be good - and to be honest, the first time I saw it, I thought it was merely amusing.But then I discovered that the characters and storyline stick with you. REALLY, really stick with you.The plot is a bit predictable, but there are twists that even I did not see coming. The character of Constantine, while not faithful to the comic, is a very good one - he's delightfully bitter, resigned, and yet at the same time determined to beat fate.Gabriel is just completely screwy.Balthazaar and all the other characters make things fun as the story developes. It's definitely worth watching, and I hope that the extra scenes and alternate endings of the soon to be released DVD do it justice!

review/text: In this era of triumphant religious fundamentalism, Small Gods is a pretty dangerous item to be seen carrying. Terry Pratchett, carrying a reputation of being a major force in writing fantasy and humour has shed both in this penetrating book. It's an incisive satire of the mores and methods of the three major religions of Western Civilization. Pratchett's astute axiom that the Discworld is a &quot;mirror of worlds&quot; applies with more force here than any other Discworld book. Pratchett casts away whatever subtle restraint he's given other philosophical issues to directly confront us with a harsh truth about faiths.The basic theme is a simple, but rarely recognized, truth. Gods are created by people. The fewer the believers, the smaller and weaker the god. When belief fades or believers eliminated, the gods cease to exist. Once mighty, the god Om has been relegated to the body of a tortoise. He retains but one true believer: Brutha, a novice in the Citadel of Om. Brutha makes frequent reference to segments of the &quot;holy book&quot; Om supposedly authored. Mystified by attribution to himself of these writings, Om wonders who really wrote them. And why they were written. What has been perpetrated in His Name?Brutha, who has a photographic memory, is conscripted into a religious crusade against neighbouring Ephebe. The Omnian Church wants to erase Ephebe's false belief that the world is a disc riding on the backs of four elephants standing on a turtle swimming through space. According to Vorbis, head of the Quisition, such false doctrine must be erased, erasing the Ephebians in the process, if necessary. Besides, Ephebe's on the best trade route to the Turnwise coast. Tucked away in Brutha's pocket, Om is taken along. But how does Vorbis expect to conquer mighty Ephebe, home of philosopher kings, with a token force of fifty soldiers?Pratchett is as direct as Vorbis is devious. There's an old saying that runs &quot;I'm not a bigot, I hate everybody&quot;. Vorbis doesn't hate anybody, just those following false doctrines. Nor does Pratchett hate anyone, but his scathing wit in this book leaves few untouched . There are some light passages, but this book is deadly serious. It's not small gods, but small minds that Pratchett targets and he hits the mark unerringly [He's nearly prescient about Christian reaction to J.K. Rowlings' Harry Potter books]. Pratchett holds the mirror before us to consider our beliefs. What do we have faith in, and what sustains that faith?. If it proves false, how do we respond? What an experience it would be to visit Pratchett when one of the evangelicals arrives at the door! If he's as verbally devastating as he is with the printed word, there'd only be a smudge on the doormat.

review/text: Of the positive reveiews, they seem to be amazed that someone can define economics. It's not really rocket science, and, in an age of plenty, it's not really about scarcity. It's about individuals making choices to maximize value. They may be bad choices, uniformed choices or perverse choices, but they have, in the final analysis, impact limited to the individual. And in most cases result in some level of increased individual satisfaction.The real danger, according to Hazlitt, is when the choices of a few people, with same kinds of fallacies noted above, are coercive, enforced by government or monopolies. Which leads us to to the negative reviews.The negatives, if we can be allowed to throw out the obvious loser rants, seem to be concerned mainly with rapacious corporations, free trade among inequal countries and natural monopolies. While these are certainly provide distortions of individual choice and informed consent, they do in the long run tend to be self correcting -- see government-sanctioned coal and oil monopolies. The real interest is in how to minimize the effects of these diseconomies.Hazlitt would argue that they are self-correcting via the collective effect of individual choices. The Marxists would argue that action based upon the sceeding of individual choice to a collective power is the solution. Surely, if we can assume there is no absolute, theoretical winner in this debate, we can look to the real world, based upon the actions of multiple forms of government and millions of individuals to provide some guidance on which path leads to the most for the most.To that end, I would challenge you to read Hazlitt's book and a Marxist equivalent like Ivan Ilich's &quot;Tools for Conviviality&quot; and then, accepting both as plausibly complete and material, match them against your experience of recent history and your hopes for your personal future.

review/text: Ray Bradbury has taken an issue so overlooked even today, to have written something about the topic of censorship in the 1950s was quite a daring act. Ray Bradbury did it well enough, and with his ficticious novel Fahrenheit 451 he explores the horrible underbelly of education and society, and forces the reader to re-examine the values of our society.In the novel, the main character (protaganist) Guy Montag, is a fireman, but not what you'd expect, his job is to burn books and the houses that contain them, but then he meets a young woman named Clarisse who teaches him the wonderful truth of books, and a place where imagination and thinking are praised. Montag become obsessive with the idea of obtaining books, knowing that they must be wonderful treasures, so great, that people would give up their lives for them.Soon, like most things in life Clarisse fades away, but so does the thin strand that was Montag's grip on life. He seems to spin out of control, the books that he once destroyed now seemed to be destroying him, becoming his every obsession. Montag finds himself becoming afraid of everyone and everything, and he feels alone, unable to be helped.Fahrenheit 451 is a fabulous book dealing with an issue that still badgers people today even in the 21st century: censorship. This book takes an immediate look at the history of censorship, and sets forth startling revelations as to what will become of mankind if we take away the creative process, the independent, thinking spirit of man and gives a warning that must not be ignored. Fahrenheit 451 is an absolutely essential read.

review/text: After many disappointments with corded and wireless headsets and the unavailability of a Bluetooth(tm) option for our phone system, I purchased the CS70 because of its use of the 6.0 DECT (1.9 GHz) band, digitally-encrypted audio (Essential for our health care office, after having a local scanner hobbyist e-mail us some of our conversations from 5.8 GHz "analog" cordless telephones.), the reported 300 foot range, less chance of interference with 2.4 GHz WiFi networks (and the other myriad of gadgets in that crowded frequency band) and recommendations that the audio was "second to none."Other cordless headsets that we had purchased in the past were useless when trying to communicate with some of our elderly, hard-of-hearing clients. The CS70 allows adjustments of both incoming and outgoing audio from moderate levels to almost painfully loud. At the highest volume settings it could almost qualify as a speaker phone in a quiet room! We have received many unsolicited compliments about our telephone call sound quality from the hard of hearing. Comments such as: "What telephone are you using? I can't understand anybody else on the telephone except when your office calls." Our clients who have difficulty hearing are much more likely to answer our calls when they see our number in the caller ID because of this. Apparently the Plantronics noise-cancelling and digital audio processing increases the intelligibility. The 64-bit audio encryption, sufficient for all but the most demanding security environments, does not degrade the audio quality - something that we noted with cordless telephones we've had in the past from Panasonic and Uniden that use FHSS or DSS ("frequency hopping spread spectrum" or "digital spread spectrum") although, as far as we know they are quite secure and our calls were never monitored successfully.The optional Handset Lifter HL-10 is anything but "optional." It is a "must have" with this device. The whole point of having a cordless headset is not having to return to the base unit for every function - especially to pick up and hang up the phone! For the price Plantronics is charging, the HL-10 should be included. Furthermore, the HL-10's compatibility, even with models that are so listed on the Plantronics website, is a relative term that will require some ingenuity to insure reliability. In our experience, a small piece of Velcro(tm) to attach the handset to the lifter works wonders, but it took several hours of "trial and error" to figure this out. Use enough Velcro(tm) to secure the handset when moved by the lifter, but not so much that the handset cannot be easily removed without yanking the lifter out of position.The biggest disappointment with the CS70 is the range. The listed "up to 300 feet" is a joke. Even in completely open terrain with no intervening walls in a flat rural area of Florida with no known powerful electromagnetic radiation sources. The best distance we could achieve was 60-75 feet and still have reliable, noise-free communications even with optimal base unit positioning in an elevated location away from all metal and other electronic devices. The range indoors, in an office environment, with sheetrock, non-metallic walls and the usual collection of office equipment and furniture drops to 50 feet AT BEST. With the metallic studs that are used as wall supports in many commercial building, the CS70 basically becomes a "line of sight" device over 25-30 feet. In one of our clinics, the range was so short that we thought that we had a defective unit. However, after exchanging it for another CS70, we got the same results. Of course, very few of us need a range of 300 feet, but it is very annoying to drop a call while making a short trip down the hall for a file. The short range reduces the CS70's usefulness as an aid to "multitasking." Could it be that the lack of an external antenna is responsible for this? Somebody needs to call Plantronics "on the carpet" for their bogus range claims.The headset, although it appears bulky, is surprisingly comfortable. Battery life is outstanding. And the headset recharges rapidly, making it easy to use the CS70 all day. If you're a big talker, you might have to leave headset in the charger during lunch. We can't comment on battery longevity since we've only had the CS70's for a couple of months.Although the CS70 touts its interference resistance, we've had trouble with the CS70 in our office near the airport. These problems did not affect the "frequency hopping" cordless phones in either the 2.4 and 5.8 GHz bands that we've had in the past. Also, some PDA telephones, like the Cingular 8125 and others, intermittently interfere with the CS70. Every few minutes there will be several seconds of static and the outgoing audio is dropped. What the source of this interference is, we still haven't determined. But it seems that it would have to either be the Bluetooth or WiFi transmitters.

review/text: The Man Who Never Was creates a solid war movie that is better known for the plot, but not for the suspense. The plot is billiant...plant fake invasion plans on corpse, and hope the Germans fall for the bait.Unfortunately, good plot movies end up &quot;connect the dot&quot; themes unless there is real suspense. Everthing goes pretty much according to plan and we don't have the &quot;Dial M For Murder&quot; or the &quot;39 Steps&quot; type of intrigue. For example, the British pretty much rubber stamp this project, despite the severity of the plan. Yes, there is discussion of the plan, but one could be arguing for more orders of ballpoint pens versus inkwell pens. Then, the villain, the one who is supposed to check out the story, pretty much covers a routine checklist that any failed detective would follow. It is not clear why he would go to extremes of sacrificing his life to determine the validity of the plot. There is little character development. Surely, there would have been better ways to obtain the truth, especially once he gets most of the clues. For example, the non-membership of the deceased at the club...following Lucy to see if she goes to any memorial services, etc. The villain would thus be hidden and not expose his identity.Still, one should not be too harsh. The plot is based on a true story and this itself gives admiration to the wartime effort of the British to beat the Germans. One can only imagine the courage of the Bristish soldier( played by Clifton Webb) in a formalized structure of the British hierarchy to not only propose this plot but to execute it. But that is why we are really ready to dodge some bullets and swing at the curve balls.I think then we would have gotten a better flavor of the team work needed to make this plot work. Then this would have been a great movie rather just a good one.

review/text: Meet the Parents and Pretty Woman were just a few of many bits and pieces they had in this movie. This movie was soo stupid. I don't mean Napolean Dynomite stupid or Anchorman stupid. A fat ugly girl turns into a skinny and beautiful after seeing Hitch in a Pimp My Ride attempt and ends up on The Bachelorette where a weirdo bachelor shoots off the loser opponents and ends up marrying her. There are many funny scenes in the movie, like the cat that takes a dump and the Michael Jackson scenes. The plot is so stupid. This movie is so stupid, that I guess it was pretty funny. It had me laughing. I seen it on a 4 dollar Tuesday night so I suggest you do the same.

review/text: You have to have an affinity for what is most loathsome in human nature to appreciate the unrelenting vileness and a-morality celebrated in this movie. Okay, whether it is actually celebrated is, of course, arguable. However, this movie does nothing more than show us sordidness after sordidness: Teenage Telly practicing his favorite pasttime (next to getting high, perhaps)--painfully deflowering very young virgins; Telly kicking some poor slob nearly to death. Sex, drugs, sex, drugs, ad tedium.This movie might show us what *some* kids indulge in, but it really shows us nothing new, leads us to no new understanding of, well, anything under the sun except perhaps our own stoicism should we heroically make it through the entire movie.In a word: Blech!

review/text: They say up front that they (the authors) purposely did not put in any writing to as not to sway our view of the clothing. Alas, that means if one does not know period clothing from LOTS of different periods, one will not be able to identify items. Still, lovely drawings. It will make a fine adult coloring book! (Yes, I'm serious) :-)

review/text: "The Mayor of Casterbridge" ought to be the model of what a classic is not. Books deemed as a "classic" are said to be everlasting and universal in its message. This book does not spread its wings into our era, and it does not apply to everyone in some way, unless you've experienced paternity uncertainty and emotional neglect. The characters are rigid, changing without reason, and lacking practical emotions. Michael Henchard is repulsive from the start, from when he sells his wife and child, to his emotional withdrawal towards the young woman who turned out to be his non-biological daughter, to hiding the truth of who her father actually was to Elizabeth-Jane, so one cannot pity his outcome. Elizabeth-Jane, the non-biological daughter of Henchard, was completely void of personality. "Blas&eacute;" has more personality than Elizabeth-Jane. After a tennis match type life, of being flung back and forth between fathers, to marrying Donald Farfrae who one day courted her, married another woman (who just happened to be the landlord of the house Elizabeth-Jane was living at, at the time), and then realized his affection for her, Elizabeth-Jane would've been a prime candidate for therapy (how could she give her heart to men who kept being introduced as her father?), but instead acted as if she was a spokesperson normalcy. Finally, Donald Farfrae, a Scotsman, who was the poster boy for blandness, never really showed growth. He was always monotone, and I could not tell if he found Elizabeth-Jane's biological father to scorn Henchard, or truly help Elizabeth-Jane find the truth. I felt naught for the characters but purposelessness, and the story itself was uncreative and improbable. I do no recommend.

review/text: This music is some of the best jazz I've heard in a while. I wasn't all that into dizzy until I heard this and realized how he personifies modernity, and not just because these recordings are from the museum of modern art. I find this stuff every bit as mesmerizing as other 60s jazz like coltrane. I like it better than dizzy's newport disc.

review/text: William Trevor?s Felicia?s Journey tracks the unfortunate travels and travails of its hero in the gothic, semi-industrial cityscape of a late twentieth-century English factory town. Her meeting of one Mr. Hilditch, the head caterer at one of town?s several factories, brings the poor girl?s already troubled life to a harrowing peril of both the physical and moral sorts.Trevor?s somnambular style glides us through a fallen dreamscape studded with flashbacks in a manner that almost exempts him of the empathetic anguish inflicted upon the reader. Almost. Indeed, Trevor?s national allegory is so grief ridden, so utterly bleak that it is difficult to appreciate the merits of this work. Felicia is so painfully nave that it becomes difficult to sympathize with her even as she is dragged through exhaustive turmoil. The audience?s hope in redemption is dashed like waves against the very shore upon which Felicia lands. So used to such incessant emotional torment is the reader that the climax fails to impress. Trevor leaves us unnecessarily jaded, allowing one final glimmer of hope only to have it washed away in the tide. As such, this reader finds it necessary to give Mr. Trevor a generous four thumbs up (out of a possible ten).

review/text: For those who wear glasses, this is the best!(Try to avoid ANY headset with hooks if you wear glasses no matter what other people say, IT WILL NO FIT and HURT your ears)For those who don't wear glasses, it is 4 out of 5 stars due to the fact that the sound quality is not as good as Samsung's WEP200. (not sure about other "hookless" headset)Battery Life, full charge, at least 4+ hours continuous talk time (I tested it personally)It weights like nothing to your ear.I had hard time to fit WEP200 on my ear, but AX2 is a snuggle fit. For half the price of WEP200, I will buy AX2.If you outside of the network and have no reception, the headset will do a "beep beep" signal for you, it will keep doing it until your phone get back the reception. Some people found it annoying, some people think this is a useful feature.Pro: Cheap, Tight Fit, VERY Light weight, BEST for people who wear glasses.Con: Okay sound quality, very loud wind noise @ outdoor (on the listener side).One more notice, for people who are going to get it, PLEASE read the instruction included carefully before you try to wear it. That plastic sticking out DOES NOT GOES INTO YOUR EAR CANAL. It sits within the grove inside of the external ear to secure the ear piece. So don't poke yourself to deaf with that.

review/text: Cynical and cold story about a 'Benefactor', who creates together with his lackeys a state of totally depersonalized citizens: conscience is a disease, cruelty is a sign of love, without liberty no crimes can be committed, sex is planned ...The precursor of George Orwell's '1984' and, more, of Aldous Huxley's 'Brave New World', for the novel lacks the 'human' touch of '1984'. It remains more or less abstract, although it contains scenes worth a Bunuel.A book to recommend.

review/text: In a small California town, life was simple for a teenage punk (Kevin Dillon) who falls for a lovely cheerleader (Shawnee Smith) but one night there's a strange meteorite crashes outside of town with a weird pink goo that consumes an old man's hand. Taken to a doctor, the weird slimy stuff is really alive for it's a monstrous organism that devours any creature or person that stands in it's way, can it be stopped?Quite an awesome remake of the 50's sci-fi/horror classic with Steve Mcqueen that is just as good but with a new explanation on the creature's origin as it's a government experiment from space gone wrong. The acting is very good and so are the nifty special effects and gory detailed scenes of people being engulfed by the slime especially the memorable man being sucked down the sink scene, the blob itself is more nastier and meaner looking then the original glob of strawberry jam.This DVD has good picture and sound quality with the only extras being trailers especially to the movie, but if you love sci-fi horror and the original then get this movie, you won't be disappointed.Also recommended: "The Thing" ( 1982), "The Blob ( 1958)", "Species", "The Deadly Spawn (a.k.a.

review/text: Great Read!Pararescue, by Michael Hirsh, is one of the most thoroughly researched contemporary military history novels I have read. As a Marine officer, I am critical of books, movies, and articles about the military when they don't &quot;get it right.&quot; I couldn't find one obvious inaccuracy in this book, which tells me Mr. Hirsh was very careful in his examination of the Air Force Pararescue community, and of the little-known USMC KC-130 aerial refueling tanker community.Most interesting to me was the comparison of the philosophies of the helicopter crews of the 102nd Rescue Squadron, and that of the Marines of Yanky 03 - the Marine tanker crew from VMGR-452. Their attitudes and beliefs seemed to be identical - &quot;Whatever it takes to get the job done.&quot; By contrast, the mind-set of the Air Force C-130 tanker crews seemed to be &quot;Whatever excuse we can find to get out of this dangerous mission&quot; and &quot;What about our crew rest?&quot; Strange that the &quot;factions&quot; mentioned in this story would be Air Force Helicopter crews and Marine on one side, and Air Force C-130 crews on the other.Air Force LtCol Fleming, the Flight-lead of the 102 Rescue Squadron's H-60 Blackhawk rescue team, and the true hero of the book, should have been a Marine. Coming from a Marine, that is the ultimate compliment. Clint Eastwood should play his part in the movie version of this book.

review/text: "The first WWI aviation film in 40 years", so director Tony Bill reported gloats in a recent interview. Actually, "30" would present a more accurate figure, considering the 1976 release of the JAck Gold's "Aces High", but no bother. I needn't fret about Bill's lack of affinity for cinematic history; his readily apparent ineptitude in both the historical and technical departments is bad enough.Talk about ineptitude (among other things), this supposed homage to an actual WWI squadron perpetuates just about every conceivable clich&eacute; imaginable, furthermore effectively stealing elements from nearly every aviation flick ever devised, including Blue Max, the Dawn Patrol, Dark Blue World, the Tuskegee Airmen, and even that age-old silent flick from 1927, WINGS. Furtherome, the battle scenes themselves reflect the most cheesy elements of propaganda war flicks, culminating in the endless ranks of snarling villains, the cheering crowds on the ground below as our heroes intercept the strafing Huns to save the day, and even a veritable race against the proverbial clock to destroy a German airship before it supposedly "obliterates" the entirety of Paris.And as of the various manners in which this film blatantly exhibits its readily apparent lack of prowess for historical and technical accuracies, let me count the ways.For starters, let's consider the countless manners in which the on-screen aircraft repeatedly defy the laws physics. Admittedly, some reviewers have pointed out Tony Bill's part-time profession as an aerobatic pilot, which in essence appears to compromised his interpretations of World War I combat, as he seems to have derived his perception of first world war fighters from having logged too many hours in Pitts Special as opposed to having derived genuine insight into the performance capabilities and limitations of such elaborate contusions of fabric and wood. For one thing, the aircraft exhibit speeds twice in excess that of the actual performance capabilities of World War I aircraft, culminating in a host of physical implausibilities as overly efficient climbing characteristics as if instigated in the absence of a stall barrier, low-level maneuvers that would have invariably either stalled the aircraft or resulted in considerable wing shear, not to mention that these biplanes and Triplanes exhibit phenomenal roll-rates which no multi-winged aircraft on the planet could possibly emulate. Evidently, Tony Bill exhibits an accurate conception of three dimensional space, but not of the actual performance characteristics of First World War-era fighters.Furthermore, the movie's glaring affinity for historical inaccuracy reflects the presence of numerous aircraft that never existed during the Escardrille's 1916 escapades, including the SE.5, Handley Page 400, Gotha IV, and of course the Fokker Dr. 1 Triplane, which brings me to another issue that drives me out of my mind, culminating in one of the most trivial misinterpretations about World War I aviation. Bottom line, the above depiction stems from a trivial and widespread popular misconception that by default associates World War One German aircraft with countless formations of red-coated Triplanes, as if the Germans had somehow managed to perpetuate endless clones of Von Richtofen, to say nothing about the fact that the Fokker Dr. 1 was ultimately produced in insignificant numbers, culminating in an actual production run of only 160 examples.In fact, the Lafayette Escabdrille fought the majority of its pitched-battles against outmoded Fokker E.III Eindeckers and two-seat Albatross and Aviatik observation scouts, the superior equipment of the Amercans frequently offset by their readily apparent lack of experience.And another thing, the average life expectancy of a World War I pilot is actually confined to the space of a single week, unlike the film's more optimistic projection of 3 to 6. Furthermore, somebody should remind the screenwriters never to emphasizes the virtues of German aircraft by citing the presence of all powerful engines, as the rates of horsepower which the Germans managed to conceive lagged considerably behind that of their allied counterparts.Furthermore, pilots were indeed NOT permitted to instill their own personal insignias, considering that, unlike World War II, rarely were aircrew assigned individual aircraft, often dispersing their ranks among the types available in a manner that typically resulted sharing planes out amongst each other. Furthermore, as blatantly misrepresnted by the closing scene, there is simply no such thing as rejoining one's formation in the event of finalizing an aerial skirmish, as aircraft frequently fought pitched battles at length, scattering miles away from each other, thus relaying each pilot with the burden of utilizing landmarks and navigations skills as the sole means for finding their way home on an individual basis.Reverting to the film's one and only redeeming feature, the various aspects in which the Flyboys attempts to model battle damage in conjunction with the various behaviors of shedding wings and burning engines bear a more accurate depiction than the remainder of the film. However, given the all too elaborate staging of such sequences through an over use of Green Screen techninques in conjunction with an overabundance of CGI effectively renders the overall appearance as reminiscent of, as one reviewer stated "playing a really cool video game" as opposed to providing a genuine "in the cockpit" sensation for the expreiences of piloting such frail machinations.Most offensive, however, is the gratuitous manner in which the movie concocts the entire spectacle within a fanciful dressing of glamour, all the while pedaling it's pretensions for historical and physical accuracy.In all fairness, perhaps I should lend Tony Bill an additional bone by citing the best moment of the entire movie, in which the guts of that blabbering Christian fanatic splatters the entirety of his instrument panel (the only moment in the entire film in which I cheered).Ultimately, the inclusion of a photograph of the actual members of the Lafayette Escadrille seems like a cruel joke, as if the preceding spectacle of cartoonish escapism somehow culminates in an authentic tribute to the squadron in question.Considering the shear sparsity of world war one related aviation flicks, it doesn't take a genius to brand this endeavor as by far the worst ever conceived.For more informative and productive viewing, I can recommend virtually every other aviation flick on the market, from the veritable classics like "Blue Max" and "Aces High" , to some of the more lukewarm efforts of "Ace of Aces" and "Von Richtofen and Brown".
