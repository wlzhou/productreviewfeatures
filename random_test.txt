review/text: Although Dolly had recorded the occasional song in a bluegrass style before, I'd never have expected her to do a whole bluegrsass album.With backing vocals by the three finest bluegrass ladies (Claire Lynch, Alison Krauss and Rhonda Vincent) and a stellar cast of bluegrass musicians (Jerry Douglas on dobro, Sam Bush on mandolin, Bryan Sutton on guitar, Stuart Duncan on fiddle, Barry Bales on bass and Jum Mills on banjo), the album is one of the best Dolly has ever recorded.The songs include covers from a variety of sources, including Billy Joel (Travelin' prayer), Louvin brothers (Cash on the barrelhead), Hazel Dickens - another fine bluegrass singer (A few old memories), Lester Flatt (I'm gonna sleep with one eye open), Johnny Cash (I still miss someone) and traditional folk (Silver dagger).Dolly's own songs are included - some old (Steady as the rain, first recorded by her sister Stella) and Will he be waiting for me (originally recorded by Dolly on her Touch your woman album) - and some new, including the title track.The tempo of the album is generally upbeat. Much credit is given to the O brother soundtrack for the current popularity of bluegrass, but it's popularity had already risen significantly as a result of this excellent album.

review/text: We're really happy with our Salton ice-cream maker. We've been making low calorie blueberry and peach ice cream that meets the restrictions of a weight-loss diet and tastes fabulous! (The high calorie chocolate etc. are awesome, too!) It's super easy to use, and in less than an hour we have a terrific dessert - even without going to the store, most of the time. Our only criticism is that it's pretty noisy. We're careful to transfer the ice-cream to a different container so we don't scratch or dent the special mixer container you make the ice cream in.

review/text: This well-rounded collection of the better-known short works of Jean Sibelius is very well served by conductor Osmo V&auml;nsk&auml; and the Lahti Symphony Orchestra. It is one of those CDs for both the passionate lover of Sibelius' music as well as a very fitting introduction to those who for some reason have not placed the great Finnish composer in their collection of recordings. While many of the works fall into the 'pops' category (well known from frequent exposure) such as 'Finlandia', 'The Swan of Tuonela' from the Lemmink&auml;inen, 'Valse Triste', and 'Tapiola', there are some significant works less well known in the concert halls. One of the more poignant of these is the 'Death of Melisande' from the Pell&eacute;as et M&eacute;lisande incidental music - an example of the fine works for theater Sibelius composed ('The Tempest' being another of these rarely performed works). V&auml;nsk&auml; and his orchestra give solid performances here, somehow making this collection cohesive.Jean Sibelius is growing in respect as one of the more important composers linking the Romantics with the Moderns and we are left to wonder what would have come from him had he not ceased composing for the last decades of his life (he died in 1957). For the past weeks the audiences for the Los Angeles Philharmonic have been blessed with Esa Pekka Salonen's survey of his fellow countryman's genius in a series he titled 'Sibelius Unbound'. The survey included all seven symphonies and some tone poems and excerpts (one of those being the luminous 'Death of Melisande') and as Salonen approaches age fifty he has become the foremost interpreter of Sibelius' music. Hearing all seven symphonies performed by the brilliant LA Phil in Disney Hall was indeed a revelation - and more profound and integrated renderings of the works will probably not be heard again. One only can hope that Salonen and the LA Phil will record the Sibelius cycle: it would doubtless be a cycle without peer. Grady Harp, November 07

review/text: I am a college student and I purchased this power adapter because my Apple adapter no longer works - the cord broke near the connector - big surprise, right. This was after 3 years. Anyway, I love this new one. It's only a week old now but I like how it looks - it's white and matches my iBook, and the cord is more substantial, but aesthetically, it is very nice and not huge or fragile looking. I thought I'd miss the light on the connector, but that's not the case - It fits snugly into the input and charges rather quickly. You really can't beat this one... even if it breaks 2 times and I replace it with a 3rd, I still haven't spent as much as I would on one of Apple's shoddy adapters. I say buy it.

review/text: This kettlebell DVD by Lisa Balash is AMAZING! Her informative intro on how to use kettlebells helps to understand the exercises she'll be doing throughout the workouts. The workouts are perfectly timed and spaced so that you get enough rest in between the exercises. She also gives suggestions on how to make it more challenging if you've used kettlebells before.I love working out at home, so it's great being able to use her dvd to refresh on proper technique and exercises I may have forgotten about. It's also a great way to get back into shape since she breaks down the workouts for beginners.I definitely recommend people who are interested in what Kettlebells are to buy this DVD. She's informative, has a great attitide and presense, and her outifts are super cute! I know I want to look as GREAT as she does in this video so kettlebells is the way to obtain a tight fit body~!

review/text: This is a great history book on the great Mongol Empire. It clears up a lot misunderstandings and superstitions about the supposedly horrible Mongol barbarians and gives a reliable account of their rule in this time period. It covers Temujin's (aka Genghis Khan) beginnings to the end of his forebears rule. It has pictures from the past and of re-enactments of Mongol cavalry - you will rarely find this elsewhere. The Mongol Empire was a militaristic nation, so this book lacks on the military strategy and warfare of the Mongols. Only the basics are covered.

review/text: While a little outdated now, The Life and Times of Jesus the Messiah remains as both an excellent and massive reference work to the historical setting to the time of Jesus of Nazareth. Written some 70 years prior to the discovery of the Dead Sea Scrolls, Alfred Edersheim's great work still offers highly valuable-and detailed-information on the Gospel and related events. One of the more striking features of this book is the appendix section which gives a list of 400+ Old Testament passages which were tagged by the ancient rabbis as messianically applied. An absolute must for any who wish to study the Jewish expectations of the coming of Messiah surrounding the days when the Carpentar from Nazareth walked the Earth. Place Edersheim's great work in your library, and you will find yourself going back to it time and time again.

review/text: If a textbook for Hindi must use some romanistion then it should use the same system as R.S.McGregors' Oxford Hindi-English Dictionary, as &quot;Teach Yourself Hindi&quot; does. The authors of that title, R.Snell &amp; S.Weightman, teach Hindi at London University's School of Oriental and African Studies.Further this textbook relegates the devanagari script to the rear of the book and includes no devanagari at all for the tape dialogues.As a final black mark the standard reached in the course is way short of Snell/Weightmann. This is partly a product of having 10 lessons instead of 18.Recommendation : Get Snell &amp; Weightmann, and then McGregor's Dictionary and Grammar. Use Bhatia if you need extra tape practice.

review/text: The odd thing about this book is why it took so long to come out. Chris Gall is an illustrator and the great-great-grandnephew of Katherine Lee Bates so I wonder why he had not created these pictures ages ago.The sixteen stunning pictures were engraved on clay-coated board which makes them very graphic rather than watercolor soft and I enjoyed the little design touches here and there, for instance a picture of some Shoshone Indians in a boat passing a very streamline looking waterfall or a small town snow scene with the buildings placed at different angles to each other.The choice of image is also refreshing, to illustrate 'A thoroughfare for freedom beat. Across the wilderness!' has a family with their Airstream parked in the open landscape or 'Thine alabaster cities gleam, Undimmed by human tears!' showing a window cleaner eating his lunch and sitting on one of those Art Deco eagles on the Chrysler Building. This kind of originality and warmth comes across from each picture.The book is well produced and it occurs to me that these illustrations are so good and all the same size that they are worth framing, depending on one's favorites.

I don't know why Keanu was cast in this role but he's the worse actor in the entire movie and Shia LaBeouf is almost as bad as he is and gives a very annoying performance that reeks of stupidity. Only Rachel Weisz and Peter Stormare are able to give good performance in this bad movie and for that, I will not totally thrash this movie but its still not very good and you should wait for cable.

Then FlatOut is the game for you. This game may not be a realistic racing simulator, may not have the best GUI for menus (can be managed with wheel and keyboard use. But for fun, this game has what you need. This game is great after those long commutes, just load it up, start a race, turn around and crash headlong into everything in sight, thinking it was that guy that was tailgating you, or that dead ass that wouldn't get out of the way. SMASH, CRASH, or get the cheat for the ejector seat and have fun throwing the dummy for distance or altitude records. Then you can mess around with different cars getting a reasonable idea about tight, loose, and all those other NASCAR like descriptions that the cars all get at times. There all there in one form or another. In all, great fun, and certainly worth the money.

review/text: I've read other books by Gabriel Garcia Marquez and have enjoyed them. This one left me cold, however. The story was very muddled and Marquez wrote in such a matter-of-fact style that there were no ups and downs. It was like watching a heart monitoring machine. Whether someone was being executed, eating lunch, or anything else, Marquez just stated everything very matter of factly. Also, the names in the book were far too similar for the average reader. I just wonder if the people who give this book great reviews are doing it on its own merit or whether they are afraid to break from the pack. It reminds me of the Emperor's New Clothes where everyone was afraid to admit that they didn't know the emperor didn't have clothes on for fear of looking stupid. Of course, it could just be me. I look for things that have a real plot or a real end they're striving for. I didn't find it in this book. I also found the spiritualism hard to believe such as Remedios the Beauty ascending into the heavens. That's a bit much for even a romantic person.

review/text: I really wanted to like this movie but The Descent was a huge predictable bore snorefest. We have six women unknowingly going off into uncharted caves thanks to their egotistic leader who decides the map book isn't necessary. Throw in the predictable rockslide which traps them inside a cave infested with half human blood thirsty creatures and we watch as the women get devoured. However, before this happens we have to sit through a good 40 minutes of character development and cheap scares. BOO! Someone jumps out at someone else and laughs. BAM! A swarm of bats rush out of a cave. BOING! A pipe bursts through a window, skewering someone but wait they wake up and it's just a dream. The soundtrack was annoying and absolutely inappropriate, rising string sections and orchestrations do not set a creepy or scary mood and the tragic accident in the beginning really had nothing to do with the overall story. It was a cheap way to throw in some blood and set up the fact that one character was sleeping with the others husband (which explains what she does in the end) but was it necessary? No, and don't worry this little snippet of information does not ruin the movie in anyway, shape or form. It succeeds in doing that on its own. The Descent is rife with clich&eacute;s (I saw the end coming a mile away), inconsistencies and improbabilities. My friend I saw this with jumped at every canned scare as I laughed and shook my head. The gore is good for those gorehounds out there but overall the entire film falls flat on its hopeful face. Checkout out the website for the real ending used in Europe which was cut out for the American release because we like our happy endings, don't we? Run, don't walk, as far away from this movie as you can, save your 10 bucks and wait for it come out on DVD

review/text: My Apple charger broke and I needed to buy a new one. Thinking it was ridiculous to spend $80 on a charger, I went with this Macally charger. I read most of the reviews here on Amazon, including the one and two star reviews from people who said the charger didn't work and, when plugged in, oscillated between charging and not charging the computer. I figured they might have received a dud and decided to try my luck anyhow. I have now received two of these items from Amazon both with the same problem. When I plugged it in and was using the computer at the same time, the power oscillated between charging and not charging every second or two. When I put the computer to sleep or turned it off, it seemed to charge the computer. Anyhow, after having the same problem twice, I decided to shell out the bucks for an actual Apple charger instead of having to deal with the annoying charger and keep sending them back and forth to Amazon.I do believe, however, that this charger fried my computer's battery. After using this product a few times, hoping I could get it to work, the battery meter would read 70% charged but the computer would just shut down because, in reality, it was not charged. The guy at the Apple store said that I would have to replace my battery eventually but that the charger probably helped speed that process along.Anyhow, I am now poorer from having to purchase both an Apple charger AND a new battery, but now I'm happy that I can actually use my laptop! I would not recommend this product to anyone not only for the inconvenience of having to deal with a faulty product but also because it can actually mess with your laptop.On a side note, Amazon returns were GREAT. Very efficient...I have not had any problems with them. They even sent me the replacement product before I had a chance to mail back the first one. Something I was not expecting at all.

review/text: I am a faculty member at a law school. When we considered revamping our curriculum, I gave the committee members passages from this book to read, where the Academy's approach is made clear. Universally, the response was: &quot;Yeah, that's how we should do things. But we have to pursue a feel-good approach now.&quot; Heinlein understands that character matters, and that institutions should encourage responsibility, not undermine it. That, I suppose, is why he was never an administrator.... Nonetheless, this is not only a terrific story, but one -- like all of Heinlein's juniors -- with a point.

review/text: The previous reviewers are absolutely right about this book. This is a fun and fascinating look back at a golden age of American popular music and the groups, producers and songwriters who made it happen. Much more than a rehash of the Motown story from secondary sources; the author personally interviewed many of the stars and lesser-known lights who helped create the music we love. Good, crisp writing and a generous collection of photographs bring the Motown story to life. A must-have for anyone who loves Motown or is interested in American popular music.

review/text: I disagree with Mr. Juanthom11 about Clay Aiken's CD. It seems to me by reading his &quot;see more about me&quot; profile that he is biased towards...well, you should read it for yourself. Being educated in music means NOTHING to me. What does mean something is an honest evaluation of Clay's singing. It is not screaming to me; it is EMOTING quite well. Plus the songs are something you can identify with and sing along to. (Maybe Mr. Jeanthom11 also needs to educate himself in punctuation: it is not apostrophe s in this instance -- that shows possession -- there should be NO apostrophes after the words. This only shows ignorance to me and further indicates he is not as educated as he wishes people to think.) Maybe some people don't realize that the more they criticize this marvelous person with an equal marveluous voice, the more we WANT to buy it and listen to it to see for ourselves, which I HAVE AND SIMPLY ADORE IT.I DON'T MEAN TO BE RUDE, BUT... Mr. Juanthom11 AND Simon Cowell may be familiar with the music business, but they don't speak for the people who made this CD a multiplatinum success. If you listen, really listen, to this CD you will understand why it has achieved that milestone.

review/text: Whether you are a newbie in science, or do research, Milloy's work is exceptionally relevant, and at the same time intensely interesting.Sadly, there seem to be very few people doing exactly what is needed in this growing area of scientific vandalism, and I applaud Milloy's courage in writing this work and others on the same or similar topic. He shows great creativity in the style and format used to write this work. It is exceptionally interesting to read, and captivates. My copy was on my office desk for exactly three days, and then without a routing list made it way through some of the science staff.I wish I had kept the statistics on this, and could plot the exact point that this work seeded an intense discussion. Perhaps a critical mass of people had been reached, and the fallout was exceptional. I suppose it will simply take more time as more and more people read, and understand the difficulties Milloy cites. It would be a shame to re-live the problems of yesteryear, and with Milloy showing the problems before they become epidemic, a double shame.Awareness if so very difficult to acquire, but Milloy does help open eyes. I would heartily recommend this book.

review/text: For years after its release, "Super Mario Bros." has been slammed as one of the worst video-game-to-big-screen adaptations, if not the worst. Yes, it does have its problems, the biggest of which is its identity crisis. It has plot, characters, motivation, and all the other good stuff a movie should have, but it doesn't know what it wants to be half the time. Is it a light-hearted action/adventure comedy? A dark cyberpunk thriller? A biting social satire? It's all of these and more in places, but never has that one, single, unifying catalyst to complete the reaction.And yet...that's part of its charm. It's all over the place, but it has something for everyone. As other reviewers have said, eagle-eyed viewers will spot countless references to the games, like a nightclub called "Bullet Bill's", and of course the infamous Bob-ombs. There are many, many more, but...let's not ruin the surprise, shall we? (Side note: Some people have complained about the current release's picture quality. A restored and remastered print may yet bring all of the details out into the open.)There is also more to be discovered about SMB. Over the past few years, a small but steadily-growing group of fans has been doing research into the behind-the-scenes aspects, conducting interviews with cast and crew, collecting rare unproduced scripts and deleted scenes, and piecing the puzzle together. There should be a future 2-disc release with all of those treasures on it, because the bare-bones version that's currently out on the shelves just doesn't do it justice.Soon, "Super Mario Bros.: The Movie" will be twenty years old. That's twenty years of an unfair reputation, and it's an excellent opportunity for Disney to bring out a new edition with extra features so that film fans and gamers alike can see the truth about this hidden gem of a cult classic. As the review on the front of the box says, "it's a blast!"

In this book, Reich draws parallels between the crucifixion and modern day emotional pathologies. It may be painful for some to read this book. It equates the 'murder of Christ' with a common modern day phenomenon of which we are all active participants.

But if you take this movie as a visually stunning masterpiece, you won't be disappointed. There are so many subtleties that capture the essence of the story without actually spelling it out for you. And it's NOT a typical romantic comedy. It's more a story about LOVE and life, appreciating what you have and finding the beauty in the smallest things. The humor is charming, the images extraordinary. Diane Lane is SUPERB in her role, and all the characters are endearing. This is a heart-warming, captivating movie that should be experienced by everyone!

review/text: I was supposed to read this book 25 or so years ago in high school. It was heavy going, and pretty meaningless to me at the time. It has come to be one of my favourite books, and I have read it more than once. The thing about hardy is that the sense of place, and time is so evocative. I have lived as an adult in Dorset - hardy Country, and recognise many of the locales he writes so beautifully about. More astounding is that some of the social mores and economic system ( indentured labour, tied villages) still exist. Like Dickens, coincidence plays a heavy hand in Hardy's plot development, a contrivance that is a little agitating to the modern, more cynical reader. Still, I find it entiely appropriate to an era when people were most often trapped in a life dictated by circumstance, when free will didn't play nearly as large a part as it does now, in a Britain where there was no place for a meritocracy, class and social station being everything. Some vestiges of that are still very evident in English life (Royalty representing the apex of the class system). Tess is a classic, well worth the effort on a number of levels - the rhythm of language, and what it says about its time and place.

review/text: This music DVD is without doubt one of the best ever made. I have always thought that Mark Knofler was way beyond Dire Straits, he was Dire Straits. He, without a doubt, is one of the most innovative, skilled guitar players I have had the pleasure to see performing live.. Now in "Music for Montserrat" playing alongside Eric Clapton, I know he is the very best there is. I would hope that all music lovers see this DVD. If you do, then you will have to have it. It is the best!

review/text: Live At Woodstock(1969).The Jimi Hendrix Experience's Live Performance at 1969's Woodstock.After the legendary previous performances at 1969's Woodstock, which included bands like Sly, the Family Stone, The Who, Santana, Joe Cocker, and the newly minted Crosby, Stills, and Nash, at 9 'O Clock on August 18th, 1969, the Jimi Hendrix Experience played Woodstock's most memorable performance, and one of the greatest of all-time. Featuring the virtuoso guitar talents of Jimi Hendrix, often hailed as the best guitarist ever, amidst bad weather and rowdy crowds the Jimi Hendrix experience played their heart out for nearly 2 and a half hours, and thankfully that concert was taped, and released for Hendrix fan's enjoyment. Below you will see how The Jimi Hendrix Experience's legendary performance at Woodstock turned out..Track Selection-Being new to Hendrix, I was taken on an unexpected but ultimately rewarding ride, as other than Rock N Roll classics 'Foxey Lady', 'Purple Haze' and 'Hey Joe', all the rest of these tracks were new to me. Songs such as 'Hear My Train A Comin', 'Spanish Castle Magic', 'Jam Back At The House', and 'Voodoo Child(Slight Return)' are basically examples of Hendrix's Guitar Mastery, his blistering solos encapsulating the echoes of time and talent to show he was surely a guitar god. 'Izzabella', 'Red House', 'Lover Man', and 'Villanova Junction' are all bluesy Hard Rockers that showcase magnificent musicianship, and could easily have been hits. 'Foxey Lady', 'Purple Haze', 'Hey Joe', and the minor hit 'Fire' are all thankfully included here to showcase Hendrix's biggest hits, but I wish he would have played more. Overall I think the Track Selection is excellent, and couldn't have asked for it to be any better! 5/5Sound Quality-For a bootleg of a concert in 1969, Jimi Hendrix Experience's performance sounds outstanding! The guitar solos and riffs blare out the speakers as if you were right there in the muddy crowd at Woodstock, Hendrix's vocals are clean, crisp, and easy to hear, and the bass and drums are clearly there and are easily hearable among the more obvious guitar. Surprisingly, some of the best Sound Quality I've ever heard from a live performance! 5/5Band Performance-What more can I say? Jimi Hendrix is in peak form here, his blistering solos and bluesy riffs, unknown at the time still retain their unmistakeable glory over 35 years later, and the backup band, which includes the bass and drums, dishes out a legendary performance alongside Hendrix. Basically, the Band Performance is flawless, perfect, OUTSTANDING! 5/5Crowd Interaction-The Jimi Hendrix Experience's concert at Woodstock boasts quite a lot of Crowd Interaction, as Hendrix usually gives a few words after every song, joking and informing throughout, and the crowd shouts often to Hendrix to 'TURN IT UP!', and it all makes for a very interesting experience!Overall, The Jimi Hendrix Experience's performance at Woodstock is unmistakenly legendary, classic and brilliant in every way, and now stands as one of my favorite Live recordings. Since I was so impressed with this, I expect to pick up many more Hendrix albums in the next few visits to the CD store!HIGHLY RECOMMENED TO FANS OF HENDRIX, ROCK IN GENERAL, BLUES, AND ANYBODY WHO ENJOYS LIVE RECORDINGS! SIMPLY EPIC, PHENOMENOL, BEAUTIFUL, AND DEFINITELY LOUD!Also Recommended-Jimi Hendrix Experience- Jimi Hendrix ExperienceDisraeli Gears- CreamExperience Hendrix- Jimi HendrixThanks For Reading!

review/text: The insider here telling all is Carrie Fisher (of Princess Leia fame), daughter of crooner Eddie Fisher and songstress Debbie Reynolds. Carrie adapted the screenplay from her best-selling novel of the same name in which she tells us what it's like (through her protagonist Suzanne Vale) to drug rehab Hollywood style. As a writer she has a sharp eye for the hypocrisy of movie land culture, dysfunctional relationships, and a splendid gift for cutting one-liners. Her dialogue made the book, and is the heart and soul of the movie. Here are a few examples:"Instant gratification takes too long." (A takeoff on, and a reinvention of, the doper's "Too much is never enough.")"...Endolphin rush." (Annette Bening corrects with, "You mean enDORphin rush.")"I am so glad that I got sober now so I can be hyper-conscious for this series of humiliations." (Suzanne Vale on her life without the deadening effect of drugs.)Playing Carrie Fisher's alter ego is Meryl Streep, one of the great actresses of our time, while Shirley MacLaine, another outstanding star, plays the mother.Streep is nearly flawless as always. She just demands the camera, and she has extraordinary talent. In the finale she sings a country and western song (from Carly Simon, by the way) and she does a great job. But she seems almost absurd in the police uni (playing a part in a movie within a movie). She doesn't seem to be achieving a comedic effect and then she does, just this side of the ridiculous. But, as usual with Steep, when the camera gets on her face, we believe her.Particularly telling was the opening scene, nicely directed by Mike Nichols. I could see the familiar Palos Verdes cliffs and the shots of the ocean below. As I waited for the SoCal scene to unfold (actually it was supposed to be Mexico) I thought, "Gee, this looks like a cheap MOW set," and I continued to be fooled as Streep is hauled from customs by the customs officer and slapped. It is only when they go to "cut!" and the movie within the movie is exposed that I realized why the set looked cheap. (Because it was supposed to!)Streep sold the scene within the scene, and irony, she was supposed to be doing a terrible job because of her character's drug dependency.Somehow a scene with Meryl Streep in it never drags. Maybe she guides the direction and the editing. Thinking back (this is the first movie of hers I've seen in years) to Sophie's Choice, for example--1982 best actress Oscar and other honors--she hasn't changed much except that she's a little more relaxed, and while her concentration is still total, there is a touch less urgency in her performance. I've heard people complain about her mannerisms, that head to the side so that the corner of the mouth goes up, a little defensive smile, and then the flash of eyes, comes to mind, and some others; but compared with say, Dustin Hoffman or (horrors) John Wayne, she's as pure as Olivier.I liked her timing on the "..And you weren't wearing any underwear" line (talking about the embarrassment of her drunk mother showing her legs at a party in the past).Shirley MacLaine is, if anything, even better here as--dare I say it?--"Debbie Reynolds," one part alcoholic, one part stage mom, and one part frustrated actress jealous of her daughter's youth and talent, all parts overbearing. I recall Shirley MacLaine as a young woman. I can see her in Can-Can (1960) showing off those gorgeous legs (she shows her legs here too, but I cringed along with her daughter). She was pretty, healthy and busting her bodice as a young actress, and I liked her, but she was never more than a popular actress. Then came, Terms of Endearment (1983).Shirley MacLaine is the classic example of the actress who really learned how to act as she got older, not unlike Betty Davis, who also got better as she aged. Shirley MacLaine (Warren Beatty's sister, one recalls) did get an academy award nomination for The Apartment (1960) with Jack Lemmon, but did not win.I liked the hospital scene here at the end, mother and daughter renewing their bonds, Shirley without her wig, and no make-up. You know you've got a serious actress when she will let herself look naturally terrible for the camera!This is a true tinsel town original in which Hollywood self-analyzes in public, to be ranked in the vicinity of Sunset Boulevard (1950) and The Player (1992)--in different ways, of course--for giving us a glimpse of what it's really like to live the dream. (Or is it a nightmare?)

review/text: The Piano Teacher is a beautifully acted, wonderfully cinematic, and deeply disturbing masterpiece. It is quite unlike any other motion picture experience I have ever had.Isabelle Hubert is a brilliant actress and she absolutely shines in her role as a psychotic piano teacher who can't get what she wants, so goes out to ruin the life of others. The movie reveals this slowly and beautifully. I was impressed that there was no attempt at pop psychology or mediocre explanations that you would expect in a Hollywood melodrama with similar subject matter. The film is done in a simple, elegant, and gut-wrentching style, sure to fascinate and disturb, even if the film is hated in the end. Also worth mentioning is that Hubert's troubled but sympathetic character lives with her mother, in what has to be one of the most chilling mother/child relationships since PSYCHO.This is an exceptional film, thought-provoking, powerful, and strangely moving. It is not for those who can't face the dark side of human nature. It's far from being a life affirming &quot;feel good&quot; movie; it's a movie that is difficult to watch and raises plenty of questions. If the difficult subject matter of 'Irreversible' interested you, then this is your kind of movie. I enjoyed it immensely, as uncomfortable as I was watching it, and consider it a worthwhile, rewarding experience.The film has a haunting and disturbing finale, and is not always easy to digest, and therefore, it is not for all tastes. For fans of French or art-house cinema, this is definitely your cup of tea.Note: Stay away from the R-rated version, which goes so far as to blur out the video images in a porn shop.Grade A.

review/text: I enjoyed this book, spending the better part of a Sunday afternoon to finish it. It is the beginning of a series focused on bright and personable young Chuck O'Malley. The young man has the gift for detective work that is a common trait of Greeley's protagonists. While the setting and character types are familiar from other Greeley novels, the story is a pleasant exploration of familiar territory. This story provided a nice balance of action, suspense, and good characters. It's frustration is that it is the first installment in a series and just when you want more the book ends. Of course, the next installment is available as I write this belated review. Chuck O'Malley may just end up on my favorite character list along with Blackie Ryan and the Coynes (Dermot and Naula Ann).

review/text: I first read this book maybe 20 years ago, when I was more accustomed to 'action' sci-fi replete with ray guns and space ships and trying to guess how such technology shaped society (a la Larry Niven, to name one). This book is more like an historical novel, or a future history, like reading Gibbons or Kennedy. What is particularly astounding about this work, which he first published in 1951 at age 31, is Asimov's ability to scale- from the drama of a handful of individuals to the seminal events of the last decades of the ancient, galaxy-wide empire (which does not even remember its Earthly origin!). Unlike Heinlein's _Citizen of the Galaxy_ or _Friday_ (or many others) we do not follow the story of a single person or family in the backdrop of a civilization, but rather, the original Foundation trilogy makes both the individuals as well as the whole history of the galactic empire come alive in an extremely concise work. Here, the context is just as important as the characters, a scaling rarely seen elsewhere. This is the book's greatest strength- which becomes one of its weaknesses: To be sure, and Asimov himself admitted as much about sci-fi in general, the characterizations are not terribly deep. Much time, he has written elsewhere, is required to build the context of the worlds that sci-fi writers create, with little time left to build characters to any depth. But we are watching the fall of worlds, so the relatively shallow characters may be overlooked.A must read among the classics of sci-fi.

review/text: I have never given less than 4 star review anywhere but I feel that this product needs a disclaimer. The lower rating in this case is because this is NOT a HALTI yet it is the first thing that shows up with you search for a HALTI collar on Amazon.com. For someone who doesn't know the difference, they will likely end up with this product. This collar is significantly different from a Halti. It's also easy for this collar to be used in a way that is very uncomfortable for a dog. We bought two and got to our training class only to be told that we had the wrong product. We were also told by the trainer that it an unacceptable tool for training a dog when a Halti is required. It fits differently and functions differently. When she took this product off the dog and replaced it with a real Halti, the dog behaved totally differently (in a positive way). I'm guessing that many have found this to be a worthwhile product. I'm grateful that I was shown the difference, thanks to the trainer. I'm grateful too that she pointed out how easy it is for this product to be used in a way that is extremely uncomfortable for the dog. If you find your dog trying to get this thing off, that could be why. I'm happy that we are now using a real Halti. I'm sharing this as a heads up to others so they can make an informed decision. Had there been a clear disclaimer, I would not feel the need to write this.

Plenty of inputs. Standard cable looks great and hd programming is stunning as well as DVD's. I also purchased calibration software, but found that I really didn't need it. My settings were very close to the factory settings. We view in movie mode with the energy settings for the back light on low. I would recommend this tv to anyone looking for a quality set with an amazing picture. Sound is through a Sony 7.1 receiver with Polk Rt's and Infinity SM speakers, and a 100 watt powered sub, so I cannot give an opinion on the sound quality.

The two ongoing stories were handled in a unique and entertaining manner.I will watch this DVD over again and enjoy it many times in the future.

review/text: Written by the father of a severely autistic boy, this book attempts to take the reader through the experiences of a young family stricken with the diagnosis of autism, and their attempts to look at the glass "half-full instead of half-empty." The birth of Stephen takes the McAndrew family on a journey of learning, pain and revelation as they struggle to understand the meaning of this jolt to their family constellation. Jeff and Debbie realize that each of Stephen's steps in life(e.g. learning to walk to wave) is a huge accomplishment. Stephen's father Jeff quotes a friend of his who was paralyzed from the neck down.."It's not about the 900 things Stephen cannot do, but rather, it is the 9000 things he can do."This is the attitude the McAndrew family lives each day with. Jeff also reflects on friends of his who have medically fragile children and how lucky Stephen is to be able to walk and to eat on his own...some of the basics we all take for granted. The theme of the book also carries a deeper tone. That is, never take a moment with your children for granted, and accept your child for what he or she is. The author spends time with the reader emphasizing the term of one of his favorite role models, the late psychologist, Dr. Carl Rogers. That term is "unconditional positive regard." So many parents spend hundreds of hours and perhaps thousands of dollars on blood tests, urine tests, dietary methods or other experimental trial with their kids. The irony is that some parents want to change their children, but fail to love them for what they are..."right here, right now." The key concept here is balance. It is important, the author says, to balance what your child is(the child's soul if you will) with what they can perform....and to learn to appreciate both. McAndrew also interviews a pediatrician and childhood friend from Sheboygan, Dr. Steven Pizer, whose comprehensive and logical answers also are filled with compassion for children and parents. Dr. Darold Treffert, who did the forward to the book, was a consultant to the movie "Rainman" with Dustin Hoffman. He has dedicated his life to the study of autism and autistic savants and his book "Extraordinary People" has been widely read. Treffert very eloquently describes the challenges that autism theorists face and postulates that "until we call things by their right names," we remain in somewhat of a classification quandary in the field of autism. In the conclusion of the book, the author tells us about the hope that is always possible and is hopeful that more genetic answers can be found in his and his son's lifetime. McAndrew adds his own poetry about his son at the end of the book along with pictures of his handsome son. He also talks about his typical son Ryan and what struggle a seven year-old sibling has in trying to understand his special brother. McAndrew dedicates the book to his wife, who bears the brunt of therapy schedules, school meetings, insurance calls, etc. while Jeff is at work. A chapter called "A Mother's Voice" is dedicated to all mothers of autistic children and their profound challenges. The book is highly applauded by local community leaders who Jeff let read his rough drafts. School board, city officials and county officials all have high praise for this original and heartfelt work. This book is a great read for all parents of special children and well as all parents. Jeff also writes and speaks for a living. He presently works as a news reporter and talk show host at WHBL Radio in Sheboygan.A little more from Jeff's bio page....he has won 16 broadcasting awards during his 16 years in journalism including two statewide awards for a documentary on the "First Step Autism Program," the first early intervention public school autism program in the state of Wisconsin.

review/text: First of all, I'm not a typical Clay Aiken fan. I'm not a teenage girl, or a drooling middle-age woman who thinks Clay's the greatest thing since Bobby Darin. I'm a fortysomething male (and no, I'm not gay) who saw Clay on "American Idol," felt there was something "magical" (in the words of Gladys Knight) about him and became an instant fan. And while "Measure of a Man" may not be a classic CD, or even one for the ages, so to speak, I find it to be one of the most satisfying, and refreshingly honest pieces of music of the year. Twelve songs and not a clinker in the bunch, all exceedingly listenable and unpretentious and and beautifully sung by a young man with incredible vocal pipes and an uncanny sense of what works for himself and his audience.The highlights: First single "Invisible," the title tune, "Touch," and the incredible power ballad "I Survived You," which Clay should have dedicated to the lunk-headed judges who clearly favored last year's head-scratcher-of-a-winner Ruben Studdard, whose entire act consisted of bad Luther Vandross imitations.Lowlights: None, although if I have any complaints with "MOAM" it's that there are one-or-two-too-many sound-alike ballads in the middle of the album and not enough acoustic, quiet moments that truly showcase Clay's vocal mastery. Also, there are too many producers working independently on each song, so the album does come across as overproduced, which is one of the few legitimate critical complaints against this album.Regardless, this is a fine debut project from a young man who is going to be around a lot longer than his air-brained critics like to think. Yes, it would be nice if Clay displayed more "edge" in future projects, but there's something to be said about an artist who isn't afraid to present a product that appeals to those of us who would rather listen to anything other than critical darlings like Outkast and gutter rappers like 50 Cent.Sorry, critics. Clay Aiken's the real deal. Now deal with it.

review/text: "A Soul Haunted by Painting" starring the incomparable Gong Li is one of her lesser publicized efforts, but no less commendable performances as the chinese painter, Pan Yuliang, whose work was largely rejected in China due to its nude content, but adored in Paris, where she ultimately studies and resides. The film follows the arc of her tortured existence, from being sold into prostitution as a teen, to her life as a minor wife of a Chinese Diplomat, to ultimately being posthumously regarded as one of the greatest painters of Chinese descent.The detractions however, are not with this film, but with the quality of this DVD's release, which almost seems to be a copy, of a copy, of a print. Perhaps in some ways not even Gong Li's wonderful career and performance can save Pan Yuliang from what appears to be a continuos disregard, and minimalizing of her abilities and significance. The puzzling quality of this release in this day and age, is most assuredly no mistake.

review/text: American photographer Lauren Greenfield's recent exhibition is entitled "Girl Culture". The artist's stunning documentary photographs are prompting comparisons to other female photographers such as Tina Barney and Nan Goldin.Like Barney, also a documentarist of the social realms of contemporary America, Greenfield painstakingly monitors subtle variations of self-representation, made congruent with commonly accepted ideals at the earliest possible stage in a person's development. The rites Greenfield are watching are those of the common girl. In this way, "Girl Culture" presents the opposite of the body-hiding conventions of Barney's East Coast WASPs. Greenfield focuses on the procedures of preparing and presenting the body in a body-fixated mass culture."Girl Just Want to Have Fun" springs to mind as a disturbing euphemism for living the life of a little girl, an adolescent, or a grown woman in the United States today. Oscillating between overeating, starving, and self-mutilation, these girls become conditioned at an early age (even as young as four) by dressing up (and looking frighteningly grown-up) in a brutally competitive environment filled with drastic misconceptions of beauty.The radical affirmation of the standardized ideal sometimes results in travesty, such as when we look through the photographer's eyes at both Las Vegas showgirls and minors wearing too much makeup. Greenfield knows her craft. Her eye is never hurtful or brutally revealing, but instead allows her subjects to present themselves the way they like, the way they live - knowing that the production of the self in front of the camera can be more revealing than any pose the photographer suggests.Beauty, for most of these girls and women, is used as a weapon. It seems to grant self-esteem and acceptance. The outer appearance supports and covers the self simultaneously until the individual is no longer indistinguishable from the masses, until it seems to blend in smoothly. The American body is a body for the masses that results in mass display of the manipulated, operated, augmented body on such ritual occasions as pageants and spring breaks. Greenfield shows the way that these rituals conceal a rigid subtext of pain, suppression, and denial.Remarkable is the sheer absence of men in all of these scenes. With the exception of a spring ritual, in which a group of men hold up a woman like a broken Barbie doll, they are almost invisible. They occupy the women's fantasies, their longings, their projections. Thus, they are included in every picture that Greenfield takes, with a girl culture unfolding in front of the backdrop of dominant male culture. In this respect, Greenfield's seemingly objective photography contains a tangiable, important critique. (Written by Magdalena Kroner)

review/text: When I was looking for what I needed one day, my psychic sense led me to this book. My analytical side wasn't satisfied until I had compared it with others on the subject, but I came back to this book for its personal stories and practical approach. Sonia Choquette is a professional psychic who has been expanding and refining her own awareness for over 25 years. She's been successfully teaching others for over 20 years how to become more aware of the psychic impressions available to all of us. But the best aspect of this book is the personal tone the author has instilled. There's nothing mystical or pretentious about Sonia, and there's nothing dry or clinical about this book. When I read it, I felt as if Sonia were here herself, telling the engrossing, often amazing stories from her life and the lives of her clients and students, and guiding and encouraging me along my own psychic pathway. She has a gift for clarity, understanding and teaching the essentials without any fluff or bluff. She shows us that the extraordinary is an ordinary part of our everyday world, and seeing the magic simply requires a new and more discerning viewpoint. Whether you want to increase your intuitive skills or are just fascinated by tales of psychics and the supernatural, you're going to love this book. My personal psychic pathway over the eight years since I first read this book has been profoundly astounding and life-changing, and I'm thankful to Sonia Choquette for her help and guidance.

review/text: I really liked this little (very little and light) mp3 player. After reading reviews here, I knew to update the firmware, which I did. I liked the software that came with it--very easy to use. The same day I received it, the screen stopped working, but then after an hour or two, I checked it again, and it was working again. Stayed working for almost a week, in which time I filled it up with songs. It was a great little player. Once I got all the songs in, I turned it on and the screen went through some error messages. The &quot;help&quot; documentation on the CD was no help at all. I got a few ideas from the Creative web site, which got me new error screens, but I never could get my computer to recognize it again. Creative was going to have me pay for shipping to return it, but luckily Amazon recognizes that customers should be valued. I'm trying to decide whether I'll order another one or try another brand. I was surprised at how quickly I filled up 256 MB, so maybe I'll look for one with a larger capacity.

review/text: I've been a Neil Young fan for over 10 years. He's been an important part of my life. I was first awstruck by the song "After the Gold Rush." I wondered, when I first heard it, whose chilling falsetto voice is that with such amazing lyrics? I was driving when I heard the song and was just blown away..I can only compare his voice to that of the singer of Five for Fighting. I find it beautiful and unique. Like Neil, himself.Prairie Wind starts with a mellow and catchy tune and then enters into a scene from Hawks and Doves with No Wonder. Very similar start off to "Captain Kennedy."Tracks 3, 4 and 5 really hit the road running. "Falling off the Face of the Earth" is a very pretty song. I especially love Neil's voice on this one and how he manages to even take it an octave higher. Very effective and melodic.What really stirred me up was the next song, "Far from Home." It's a blues/folksy song with horns intermixed (like from his album "This Notes for You." You'll find yourself slapping your knee or stomping your foot on this one. The song itself is a reflection on family values, memories of growing up, his father and his longing for the stark tranquility of the prairie, which I can strongly relate to..Next, is my favorite song, "It's a Dream." This is a masterpiece through and through. The way Neil conjours up images of the past and explains them is amazing. The song brings visions of a simpler and better time. A boy fishing under a bridge, the blueness of the sky, the winds of autumn, an old man taking time to talk to a policeman when policeman had time to chat, the imagery of a train station and its passengers departing into the prairie. For Neil, these were days passed by that he is longing for again. A more innocent time. This song brought tears to my eyes for so many reasons. Almost like "A Man Needs a Maid" does for me when I hear the lyrics "..when will I see you again?.."Here there is a more classical music sound mixed with the tune.Of course, you'll never hear it on mainstream radio due to being too lengthly and actually having substance. Truly a great song that makes you think of your own good memories. Neil really gets in your head with this song.It truly, to me, is one of Neil Young's most amazing songs ever made."Prairie Wind", "Here For You" and "This Old Guitar" all are very good songs, as well. "This Old Guitar" seems to come from Harvest Moon and is very nice. "Prairie Wind" is catchy with repeated chorus verses by backup singers (I think Pegi, his wife, and Emmylou Harris)"He Was The King" is a tribute to Elvis and "When God Made Me" is almost a gospel song. I could easily see churches using these lyrics for their choirs to sing. It's a nice song asking questions of belief, existence and why we're all here. I heard Neil play this live and liked it.All in all, this album fuses sounds from Harvest, Harvest Moon, On The Beach, This Notes for You, Silver and Gold and Greendale in a very smart way. Neil is always changing and inventing himself. This is why I love his music and presence so much.I can't wait to see what's next.Great effort by the master!

review/text: I've tried a couple of times to read this book, and honestly, I never got past the first page. I think it's the biggest hoax ever perpetrated on a gullible literary world, and if James Joyce was sane (as I seriously doubt) then he must have had a huge laugh at its expense. However, I think he must've been totally nuts to write such garbed nonsense.I read the glowing reviews by other readers praising Joyce's &quot;genius&quot; and begin to doubt my own sanity. Is it possible I just can't read as well as I've always thought I can?However, I truly think they're just afraid to express their real opinion, after so many have called this thing a work of genius.

I highly recommend it as it really does a superb job.Only thing I can mention that is not positive is that it has its own setting so if the room is already warm and you leave this on the room will get warmer than it already is so it does not coicide with the temperature in the room. Otherwise amazing machine. I highly recommend the Honeywell HZ-708 it has a temperature control setting and I am very pleased with that model.

review/text: Koontz can write. But he sucks as a story teller. Books are supposed to have a COMPLETE story in them, no? Well this one has no ending. No end at all. These 2 detectives are clued in to the fact that Dr Frankenstein exists, and is creating his "perfect race" to some day kill off all humans. That's it. You meet the original, now educated and "at one with the universe" Frankenstein's monster, you meet the main characters, and they have some conflict. That's the whole "story" in this book, which it really isn't because the basic elements of a story are a beginning, middle, and end.

review/text: Does anyone remember seeing a movie called BABE? Maybe about 15 years, or so, ago? It is a story about Babe, a pig who is raised by sheepdogs, and learns to herd sheep, with a little help from Farmer Hoggett, played by James Cromwell.I have never been able to forget that mean cat in this movie who said to Babe, "You don't have a purpose."Worse than that? The look on Babe's face when she realized she had no purpose - that was a killer. Babe was perfectly happy before being asked that question but suddenly was so deflated. That cat was really a rotten cat! Or was she? Maybe Babe needed this incident, cruel as it was, to make her desire a purpose!There is a wonderful barnyard filled with animals, all with a purpose. All delightful. Do you remember James Cromwell, the farmer?I am writing a story on Finding Your Purpose and using the song James Cromwell sang . . . If I Had Words. I think seeing this scene reminds me of how excited GOD might have been right after he created Adam. Having foreknowledge does not mean you can't be happy and excited (in the moment) when something wonderful happens. Cromwell has dust on his finger nails from working on the farm; the LORD God formed man of dust from the ground so would he have had dust on his fingernails? Imagine that!This movie, aside from entertaining, made me think a lot about having a purpose and what my purpose was. What a great teaching tool that was for me! Everyone is born with a purpose and gifted for that purpose from his or her mother's womb. We often miss it but we wander around a lifetime until we find it - that is, if we keep seeking for happiness and being fully alive.God gave Adam a purpose right off - he gives us all a purpose built in - a chip? maybe in the soul? maybe? But he gave us a purpose and will have given us the gifts to fulfill that purpose. We should all look for that purpose!One day, maybe today, he will rejoice over us with singing - Zephaniah 3:17 The LORD, your God, is in your midst, a warrior who gives victory; he will rejoice over you with gladness, he will renew you* in his love; he will exult over you with loud singing as on a day of festival.Surely he will when we find our purpose and use it.Go track down If I Had Words and be entertained by James Cromwell.

And this album is the reason why, brothers and sisters. You put it in your CD player, firstly noticing the tasteful packaging, and glorious cover, and then prepare yourself for the sounds that will issue forwith. And let me tell you, brothers and sisters, the sounds are good. Sonic Shake explodes in your ears, making you grateful for everything, making you thank the lord you can hear the beauty, and making you expell any thoughts of inferior bands from your mind. Sonic shake will make you dance, brothers and sisters, with it's choirs of schoolgirls, and guitars that sound like they were forged from the same ingredients as 'Snapple'; Made from the best stuff on earth. And then, Divine Imperfection, with its huge Kick-Horn section, and Gospel choirs, and OH! A CHORUS THE SIZE OF A PLANET! And then you remember that this man, this SILVER GINGER used to be in the Wildhearts, used to make rock music for people to rock to, and ANyway but Maybe, track 3 reminds you of this! The Girls are better than boys, which IS Slade, and Brain Sugar, the catchiest song ever written, and Rock N Roll Girls, and Monkey Zoo, and Inside Out (Country and Western) and..... And then, Brothers and Sisters, you regain yourself, and you see the album through, and you realise that it is up there with the greats, up there with KISS and the MC5 and the Clash and the Stones and the Beatles and David Bowie's ZIggy Stardust and Mott the Hoople and CHeap Trick and Aerosmith, and just about anything good and fun in the last fifty years. And you smile when you hear the Bee Gees cover that closes the album, and you reach over and push Play again, and when, Brothers and Sisters, when Church of the Broken Hearted comes on, and sums up the feeling you've all felt of being left alone, you smile, and thank God that you heard this album. Taht is all. Go forth and Love Silver Ginger 5. SG5 Bless you.

review/text: This is the greatest horror film, and one of the greatest films ever, period.Everything in it works. From that terrific tag line to the creepy poster art, to that off kilter lullaby Mia Farrow croons, to every single performance, line of dialogue and scene. The cast is perfection. The terror is palpable. The extras set the movie in its time, but the movie has surpased its time and become, like all true classics, for the ages. The Bramley will never be razed for a parking lot. Ira Levin's superb novel was blessed by Roman Polanski's film. Both are landmarks touched with more than a little genius.The movie is wickedly funny, deliciously entrancing, groundbreakingly "real" because it's horror is set in present day New York; also, the elderly couple next door, who are the coven leaders, are played to the hilt by nosey Ruth Gordon and the intriguing Sidney Blackmer; therefore, it's easy to come under their spell. Blackmer especially gives an almost noble performance that is rich and wise. The entire cast is at the top of their game.Maurice Evan's Hutch is the hope and comfort of the film, the logical reality against what is inexorably happening, while Ralph Bellamy's Dr. Saperstein (he was on "Open End," you know)is that soft spoken easygoing evil that you just know hides a little below the surface of most of his ilk. It's also fun seeing Hope Summers (Clara Edwards of "The Andy Griffith Show") as a Satanist. Not out of character here, really. Did Aunt Bea ever find out?It's ironic that the movie probably could not be made today. The current crop of puritans would rail against it; odd, since the bare bones of the plot hew to what they say they believe. But while those lame Left Behind movies and the others artlessly propound beating foolish stuff into its audiences heads, "Rosemary's Baby" plays knowingly with fiction, with what ifs, with the paranoia come true, all in a twisty gripping eerie exciting film, produced by the great William Castle, who has just the right cameo that comes with the chill first, then the laughter.Mia Farrow's heart wrenching Rosemary Woodhouse leads us into her terror and pain, then into her first goosebumpy nightmare come true reaction to her son, propelling into that final reaction, maybe even scarier, as the camera wisely pans to the window and the outside of the Bramley. There are some fine character actors as well, always dependable Elisha Cook, Jr. Philip Leeds and Patsy Kelly.John Cassavetes, as Guy Woodhouse, also creeps us out as he sells himself and Rosemary, and I guess, their baby, and the world, to Satan, to further his acting career. Being in bit parts in "Luther" and "Nobody Loves an Albatross" can only take an actor just so far. Priorities, after all. So settle down with some "plain old Lipton Tea," a bowl of "chocolate mouse" and a Vodkda Blush, and watch a classic again or for the first time. Watch out for mouse bites, though.

review/text: Having read Feehan's &quot;Dark&quot; series, I have to say that I think this is her best book ever. THE SCARLETTI CURSE is a true gothic romance, and people who love gothics--like me--will definitely want to read it.The book has elements that were in Feehan's vampire novels and which will be familiar to that audience: telepathy; a dictatorial hero (the curse of the Scarlettis is that they're supposedly destined to kill the women they love in jealous rages); the heroine with REALLY long hair; destiny. There's also the quintessential gothic palace--poetically called the &quot;Palace della Morte&quot; by the local villagers--with hideous artwork, secret passageways, etc., etc., whose inhabitants all seem to be up to something nefarious.I quickly became completely engrossed in the story. No, it's not terribly original, but I loved every turn in the plot, anyway. The story is told very much from the heroine's point of view, which is appropriate, and all the other characters were well filled-out and suited for their purpose in the book. The reason I'm giving THE SCARLETTI CURSE four stars instead of five, however, is that the book, while enjoyable, did have some problems. For example, the love scenes seemed emotionless and out of place in the novel, which was odd because Feehan usually excells at love scenes. I also thought the explanation for everything happening at the &quot;Palace della Morte&quot; didn't quite make sense.Despite these two things, however, I thoroughly enjoyed THE SCARLETTI CURSE, and I think Christine Feehan has found her niche! I would recommend this book to anyone who enjoys the work of Ann Radcliffe, Mary Stewart, the Brontes, or even Lisa Jane Smith. Definitely, a good read.

review/text: Rarely does a movie live up to its hype. This is one of the exceptions.If you didn't catch this movie in theatres buy it now. It's not only as good as you've heard, it's actually even better. For the first time, a Batman film has succeeded completely in capturing all of the elements of the fabled comic book character while also producing a Batman that seems fully grounded in reality.Let's face it, though the Tim Burton Batman movies have a large and devoted following, those movies are ultimately less about the Dark Knight and more about Burton's ongoing fascination with offbeat characters and the bizarre. Joel Schumacher's "Batman Forever" was an enjoyable if overly campy romp but by "Batman & Robin" this series had collapsed under the weight of too many villains, sidekicks, and corny dialogue. It's telling that on the recent DVD special edition of that film even Schumacher admits that movie stunk and issues a public apology for running this series into the ground.This meant that "Batman Begins" director Chris Nolan had a hell of a task on his hands when he took the reins of this film: Deliver a Batman film for the 21st Century and restore credibility to the character.The idea of going back to the character's origins was a master stroke and serves the story well. Here we get the most detailed on-screen documentation of Batman's beginnings ever shown and damned if it all doesn't come off as more than a little epic. Much credit must also go to Christian Bale in the title role.It helps that Bale is the first Batman who is diesel enough to play the role without the benefit of a muscled, rubberized suit. Seriously, you could probably crack walnuts on this guy's abs.It helps that he also looks good in a tuxedo. The whole appeal of Batman was always that as Bruce Wayne by day, he was the biggest playboy this side of James Bond. But by night he was an obsessive revenge freak bent on striking at criminals from the shadows. Bale's got the acting chops and the look to nail this in a minute.The movie also benefits from a strong supporting cast. While much of the pre-release publicity on this point went to the future Mrs. Tom Cruise, Katy Holmes, the real standout performances come from Michael Caine as Alfred, Wayne's stalwart Butler, Gary Oldman as the Gordon, one of Gotham's last honest cops and the city's future police commissioner, and Morgan Freeman as Lucius Fox, an inventor who helps equip Wayne for his war on crime.One thing that is a holdout from the earlier Batman films is that the movie features two villains, in this case criminal mastermind Ras Al Ghul and Scarecrow. But where this detracted from Batman in the earlier films, it works here because Nolan keeps the story centered where it ought to be, on the Dark Knight.Granted these aren't exactly A-list Batman baddies but "28 Days Later"'s Cillian Murphy imbues Scarecrow with just enough serpentine evil to make him a major player.Hardcore Batfans will of course know that Ras Al Ghul, though not a household name, is depicted in the comics as the Caped Crusader's most dangerous adversary. As the head of centuries-old criminal empire with ties to all levels of government and organized crime, he's the Batman universe equivalent of Keyser Sose. The movie gets this exactly right and you're likely to be thrown by a nifty twist involving this character.If there's one complaint about this movie it's that it's perhaps too long. But this is perhaps expected given that movie not only introduces Bruce Wayne/Batman, his entire supporting cast, two villains, and lays out a plot to destroy Gotham by driving its citizens mad.Still this movie is a treat and stands along with Sam Raimi's Spiderman films as the new benchmark by which all superhero films will be measured.So now that DC is shown that they can get Batman right on film and is getting ready roll out a new Superman next year, how about they drop the Caped Crusader and Man of Steel fixations and greenlight movies based on some of their other cool characters.A Flash movie would be awesome if done right and, speaking of "greenlighting" where's that long-discussed Green Lantern flick.Come on DC! Marvel seems to be prepping movies for just about every single one of its characters, including the C and D list ones. Get on the ball!Here's my last suggestion in four words: "Jim Carrey Is Plasticman!"

review/text: The original transformers were meant to be a two sided commodity, to be so one half would be a cartoon and the other an action figure line. The cartoon, to be successful would have to be accepted by kids and their parents. To please children it contained action, cars, and a variety of characters, some silly some serious. To please parents the shows would have a passing moral and a code of conduct. In the first animated Transformers movie that code changed and Optimus Prime died.As I skimmed this movie I was treated to a world of unrealistic fantasy. There seemed to be some fun points, but overall this was a silly movie that crammed together pop icons, more story than was really useful, unbelievable relationships and situations (this is with suspension of disbelief at level 11) and a complete lack of any moral. In fact, when the final battle came to a conclusion it was the hero of the Autobots who took it into his own hands to brutally kill his two foes. The only good thing about this ending is that those foes would be necessary for a sequel. Optimus Prime and the entire cast of characters are all very much adult, all very much amoral when it comes to the enemies they face and the enemies the Autobots face are of course very amoral themselves.So it comes down to a question of who cares. Who cares if the main human character has trouble finding a job, his girlfriend is smoking hot (but didn't she have black hair at some point?). Who cares if the Earth is threatened, we know it isn't going to be destroyed anyway. Who cares about the Autobots, they are friendly to humans, but they are just as violent as the Deceptocons when you get down to it. Who cares about the humans, they are a bumbling mess. Who cares about those two ity bity Autobots? Wait, I did, I actually thought their deaths (if they did die) were quite heroic.So that is that, the stakes were low, my investment was low, and this movie, though a commercial success will surely go on the list of rarely watched movies from the teens because it truly sucks.

I found that my indoor and low light pictures with the onboard flash couldn't compare to the awesome pictures I was taking in good light with my A2. I did my research and found that the 3600HS was a good bet for my budget. I bought this flash and started taking much higher quality indoor pictures right off the bat. This thing works seamlessly with my Dimage A2 and it is money well spent. If you aren't sure whether or not to buy an external flash, you can take it from me that if you go with this guy here you won't be wrong.

review/text: I have been waiting for this set to go on sale at our local Toys-R-Us for a month. We bought it yesterday and to the surprise of my husband, I was able to put it together (not the swing arm though) in 1 1/2 hours with the help of the 12 year old neighbor girls.My 17 month old daughter absolutely loves it. She was trying to play on it before it was even fully assembled. She easily climbs onto the lower platform herself and is even able to climb up the rope ladder (though she can't climb down it) It is low enough to the ground that if she would accidentally fall off she should not sustain serious injury.We love that this is a jungle gym and swingset combined and hope that it will last her until around age 5, when we plan on building a large wooden play structure.A tip though, you do need to drill THROUGH the plastic in many places, this is not explicitly mentioned in the instructions and I was hesitant to do so but it is necessary.

review/text: I saw this movie for free at a European film festival, and I feel *lucky* to have done so! I liked it so much that I saw it again, and I loved it AGAIN! I'm hoping it goes mainstream so that it gets the audience it deserves (and video prices will go down ;-) ).Not only does it excellently execute ALL the elements of the film; it also leaves you thinking - about fate, luck, and even love. The way Tom Tykwer blends wonderful cinematography, infectious music, and innovative montages of different film techniques and formats into a highly immersive movie is sure to be appreciated by critics, serious movie aficionados, and masses alike. Emotionally, one feels immediate affinity and sympathy to the lead characters and their situation, the humor is seamlessly infused in the film (read: no jokes or comedic cliches, yet it WORKS!), and the powerful bond between Lola and Manni is very subtle, but very stated at the same time. If only for its sheer novelty and refreshing nature, I believe this film will be one that will be remembered in this century's movie history for its perfection in combining universal themes, visual and aural cinematic elements, classic film formulas, and, well, innovation!

review/text: I saw this film six times when it played in IMAX theaters about seven years ago, often taking friends who had not seen it. Since then I have been annually pestering the people at Extreme as to when a DVD might be available. This year's email turned up gold; it's out!I think this film is utterly extraordinary. To me it's actually a serene meditation on art, beauty, elegance, and the human spirit. I'd been hoping for a DVD release because I periodically felt a need for an Extreme "fix"; and it simply has not been available at regional IMAX theaters anymore. I would love to see it occasionally when I need reassurance as to what is worthwhile in the human spirit!The previously released soundtrack is also one of my favorite albums. And the pairing of that music to the film is unbelievably inspired, For example, Morsheeba's "The Sea" is played during a snow/mountain episode, not during the surfing -- and it works so PERFECTLY! Whoever coordinated the soundtrack is a genius imho! It's right up there with "The Good, the Bad, and the Ugly" and just a handful of other movies as having perfect soundtracks (again: imho!). Along these lines, when the film was showing at our local IMAX theater, a reviewer wrote a basically good review -- except that he criticized the soundtrack. He said the music should have been more driving -- hard metal or some such. I just shook my head and wondered at how he could so totally and utterly miss the point of "Extreme." I guess he thought it should have been some kind of testosterone fest with pounding music to drive home the point. I'll stick with my assessment of the film as a meditation!

review/text: A friend of mine suggested this book for a number of years. Having seen the not-so-great movie (for one reason), the book just didn't appeal to me. But I finally relented and read it. And I loved it. In fact, I immediately read the 4 sequels and I'm anxiously waiting for the 6th and (possibly) final book in the series. Maybe I like them because I'm not a literature snob (that's a friendly snipe at another reviewer).Ayla is a great heroine. She is beautiful, smart, and a survivor! Of course all of her achievements (taken together in this and the later books) aren't realistic. She is an idealized character. She is symbolic of the new and improved, modern homo sapiens. And I dig her!My only criticism of the book is that the frequent lengthy descriptions of the flora are repetitive and long-winded, but after a while I learned to skim through those pages (sorry, Jean).For entertainment value, "Clan of the Cave Bear" and its sequels can't be beat. There are hardships, conflicts, conquests, and loving relationships. But there is much more here than just entertainment; there is an education in anthropology and botany that should be worth a few college credits!I found "Clan of the Cave Bear" and the entire series to be totally unique -- human drama and lovable characters (all except Broud, that is), when the characters are all cave people! Who would have thought?!? And by the way, after reading the books and then watching it again, the movie really wasn't that bad!

review/text: The Thread That Runs So True was a marvelously written autobiography with much meaning. Jesse Stuart wonderfully depicted his life as a school teacher. Somewhat near the beginning of the book, the written meaning of the title is revealed when Stuart is singing a song containing the words. The thread that runs so true is play, which is emphasized throughout the book. Yet, there is a more meaningful lesson taught. Contextually, it is evident that the thread is also the teaching profession itself. Stuart's thread would most likely be the country life. After being a successful teacher and administrator, traveling abroad, and numerous other ventures, he returns to his Kentucky home and farms sheep. This is fantastic for almost any audience, students, teachers, and those who were once either or both. It is filled with unbelievable experiences from Stuart physically fighting his students to him being shot at for dating a particular lady. In the case of good fiction, you must remind yourself that the events didn't actually happen. In reading this book, I learned that with the most interesting non-fiction, you must realize that the events actually did occur.

review/text: Too bad there is not a rating of MINUS-stars. This film is garbage; boring, pretentious, and meaningless. Perhaps other reviews can attach their own fantasies and for them this DOA film may say something. But I found it an irritating waste of time. When a script and the characters within it have no definition, no relevance, and no entertainment value - watching it becomes either self-torture or an exercise in pretending that it serves some arty vision. This is the only time that Mel Gibson let me down. I understand he donated his services to this production and, in that case, he was very much overpaid.

Very reassuring and confidence boosting.I now spot giftedness in others, see how they, too are underachieving in order to fit in, and recommend this book to them. Worth every cent!

review/text: The little squeegy bug didn't know who or what he was. He wasn't an ant or a cricket or even a flea and he wanted to find his purpose in life. When he met Buzzer the Bumblebee, he decided he wanted to be special, just like him. But how could he find a pair of silver wings and a stinger? Buzzer tells Squeegy he'll have to touch the sky to get a beautiful pair of silver wings like his. So that's just what he tried to do. He spent three days climbing the tallest thing he knew of, a cattail, certain it must touch the sky. But on the third evening, he was caught in a terrible storm and saved from certain disaster by a very nice caterpillar, who took him in and gave him a place to sleep. The next morning, the two travel to the web at the very end of the cattail and consult with the all-knowing, Haunchy the Spider. Haunchy weaves Squeegy a beautiful pair of silver wings for his back. But there is no stinger. Instead, Haunchy reaches up and grabs the brightest star in the night sky, attaches it to Squeegy's bottom and names him Squeegy the Firefly, the Lamplighter of the Sky..... Originally published in 1946, Bill Martin Jr, Michael Sampson and Pat Corrigan have teamed up to create this new version of a timeless classic. Their gentle, magical, understated text is enhanced by their high-tech geometric illustrations and together they've authored an innovative and creative story that will mesmerize youngsters with its simple message and bright, bold, textured artwork. Perfect for kids 4-8, The Little Squeegy Bug is an uplifting treasure to read and share again and again, and pass down from one generation to the next.

review/text: But i can't give it more than 3 stars. Why? first, as the reviewer below states, Peter Kingsley throws out an awful lot of assumptions without any backup. No guided footnotes, no back story, just a jumble at the back of the book for people to sift through. Combined with his sensationalist style a-la The Davinci Code (not sure which came first), it's awful and insulting. Perhaps because of this style, he ends up wasting our time as he thinks things through for himself in parts without just giving us the information to think through ourselves - as if we're incapable of doing so...i really wonder how he can be a university professor since he talks to us like we're in high school. He does this while also telling us how great it is that the ancient Greeks did no such thing - they wrote simply but with deep meaning, and let the reader figure it out (i guess he's not as clever as they were? or does he think we aren't?) Oh, right -- throughout the book he explains that scholars are stupid and only he and a few others really understand how to explain what's going on! Yes, that's why!But even with all that, i was getting into this book in spite of myself, as he brought out a lot of interesting facts about the Phocaeans and Parmeneides. But when he literally pulled this one out of his a**--he said that some scholars actually believe the harmony of the spheres heard by Pythagoras was the sound of a snake hiss--i had to just laugh. Now, it's true that a large portion of people don't actually hear overtones, but there are many of us who do - and you don't mistake the sound for a hissing snake. Furthermore, to say such a thing totally dismisses all of Pythagoras's teachings about harmony and the overtone series, which wouldn't exist if all that were the case. But saying they sounded like "pipes" as Parmeneides and Pythagoras in fact did would be a better bet. I guess Peter likes to take what those dumb scholars said if they fit his own agenda. Indeed, Peter Kingsley apparently dismisses the actual word for pipes USED by the ancients, to bring hissing snakes into his theories. To twist something so simple around like that just made me lose respect for him. Sorry Peter. I wanted to like you because it's obvious you're a great student of this stuff, but you owe us a little more than that.In the end, what we learn that is so important is actually nothing new - that the great philosophers, mathematicians, etc. in ancient Greece were mystics, and that Plato shut the door on that. Well, that has been an acknowleged fact for a long long time. The sad thing is, that this book has some interesting information about the mysticism practiced. But it's couched in paragraphs and paragraphs of an angry tone about how there's a conspiracy (yes he uses that word) to keep people from knowing it. Too bad - but i guess it's because, if you take all the unnecessary stuff out, it would've been a much thinner book.

review/text: The last line of my review comes first:If you do not find church humor and church-esque situations (including a lot of parodying of church ideology and customs) funny, either due to inexposure (like me) or too much exposure (fundamentalism), this book is NOT for you.And now the review:I love Terry Pratchett - he is my favorite author of all time. And I picked up this book hoping it would become one of my favorites.The fact is, I didn't find much in this book that was funny.This novel moves along at a snail's pace, in terms of the plot and the humor. The chief reason for my disillusionment is that Pratchett includes a LOT of church analogies into the novel. The characters are all church characters. And the god is not so godly. Over half of this book came across as a particularly long and pointless conversation between a dullard and his favorite stuffed animal.Overall, I wish I'd had a review that had warned me thusly:(last line of the review)

review/text: After reading Murray's book, even the most skeptical reader will be tempted to take up the craft of writing - at least as a hobby! At the same time, Murray teaches important attitudes, skills, and techniques involved in writing a variety of genres and in getting published, so the book also appeals to those interested in writing professionally.Murray's appeal to such a diverse audience begins with his development of an intimate relationship with the reader in the introduction entitled &quot;Why I Write.&quot; The reader can easily imagine having a cup of coffee with Murray while he shares the story of his birth as a writer and what motivates him to continue his writing life.But it's not just about him. With charming candor, Murray invites readers to explore the possibilities of a writing life for themselves. While encouraging us to overcome our fear of writing and to develop a writing discipline, Murray comes across as a combination fairy Godmother and Olympic training coach. His maternal tone urges us to give ourselves &quot;permission to write&quot; and provides comforting advice. Yet, like a coach, he also expects us to challenge ourselves, set goals, and stop making excuses for not writing.The first few chapters of the book also focus on &quot;cultivating a writing habit&quot; and provide tips on self-motivation, attitude, subject matter, elements of voice and discovery through keeping an open mind.Once he has his readers convinced of the personal joys and benefits of the craft and confident in their own potential as writers, Murray shifts the focus to teaching techniques for the specific genres of essay, fiction, and poetry. These chapters may easily be used as springboards for writing exercises that are non-intimidating and likely to produce exciting results.In addition, Murray generously shares samples of his own early drafts with crossed-out lines, notes in the margins and detailed discussions of why he made the changes he made. Anyone who thinks that professional writers simply sit down, receive inspiration and then spontaneously produce masterpieces will learn a lesson from Murray about the energy and commitment involved in the craft of writing.Every step of the way, Murray displays rigorous honesty about himself as a writer, about the joys and struggles of the writer's life and about what it takes to please a reading audience.The book ends with a discussion of the revision process and the usefulness of sharing our writing with a community of others who take the craft seriously. These companions can help us stay motivated, provide feedback about what works, catch mistakes and provide inspiration.If you are interested in a writing career, Murray's last chapters will also help you understand the relationship between writers and editors, how to plan a book and how to prepare a manuscript for publication.However, you need not be a serious writer to enjoy this experience with Murray. He probably will convince you that you need to write at least for yourself, but even if you remain opposed to the idea, you are bound to feel a deeper understanding and appreciation of the writing process.

review/text: Asimov is often said to have a flat style and to be unable to create credible characters. It's my opinion. And Asimov is never more ridiculous than when he writes about feelings, especially about love (scenes seem to be described by a child or a thinking machine). But this writer is still gifted at setting clever plots every reader will enjoy, for instance in his robots tales (of course do not expect more than a quality entertainment, as often with sci-fi). However, Fondation is not really a clever book ; it is not boring, but it has poor content. You will finish it but probably won't read it again. First problem, it is impossible to believe in psychohistory, which smells like positivist propaganda from the 19th century. And because he has nothing more than an adventure story to tell, Asimov uses all kinds of tricks to grip the reader, including lots of surprises justified by unlikely and twisted arguments, some of which you may find hard to swallow. To conclude, Fondation is a kind of cartoon : a succession of sketches, rather funny but unlikely. If you still absolutely want to read the book, don't read Dune before. As regards depth, writing, and imagination the two books are separated by lightyears.

review/text: The Third Secret follows the typical suspense/thriller model. It is adequately interesting to keep one reading. The early pages filled with interesting bits of information about the Vatican's history. However, (And I won't give away the secret) at about page 350, the book takes a dive. Steve Berry apparently thinks that no one will object when he shoves in his personal views on divisive church issues. But whether you agree with him or not, the revelation is completely unwarranted. I suppose Berry was trying to set his religious thriller in the same vein as Dan Brown's "heretical" books. In the end the book devolves into a treastise of Berry's personal views, presented in a way that debate is impossible. That added to the absolutely deplorable behavior by the story's protagonists (which Berry makes no attempt to challenge) makes this book a disappointing read at best.

review/text: I have just read the Dutch translation of this book and the three next ones. They are all very good written, I couldn't stop reading, and because of my busy job I unfortunately couldn't read them as fast as I could, so it took me a month.Normally, I don't like romantic books. But these are of a very different class, and I consider myself to be very cynical (hey, I even write this review).What impresses me are not just one major point, but a lot of things. The depth of the characters, the broad description of the surroundings and the way of life, the humour, the change of pace in the storylines, the good continuity and internal consistency, the many details and still an eye for the whole story.In thick books and series of books, the details often are not consistent with the previous chapters and books. I couldn't find such inconsistencies here.The stories are written in such a way, that I often felt like Ayla. I could see the people, the nature, the animals, in my imagination. It's nice to go further than the books go, like imagining what happened to any survivors of the earthquake, or how Durc is developing into manhood, or how Broud might be dethroned as leader of the clan.The only minor point I can think of is the description of the sexual intercourse, which happens a lot over the four books. Some older women I know personally made me clear that it is very special to have it described as this in good books as these.It is indeed quite emancipatory for women, to read about a girl that dares to do things that are not commonly accepted. When she grows up, she becomes a self-aware woman, almost a hero like Odysseus, inventive, brave, strong, beautiful, smart and with a pleasant character. Who wouldn't like to be like her?The four books also give me a good feeling about the era in which the stories happen. It almost makes me understand the human race better, it almost makes me a bit less cynical (how is it possible that the human race survived after all the things it went through, after all the atrocities and stupidities...).All in all, I think Jean Auel wrote four fantastic books and I can't wait for her to finish the fifth. And now I know there is a movie about Ayla, I want to see that as well.

Not only is this excruciatingly real tale of suffering and survival rivetting in all its no-holds-barred accounts, but I found the history and information about whaling and Nantucket to be very interesting. Philbrick did a marvelous job of weaving so many accounts of this tragedy into a single, seamless, powerful narrative.

I'll admit that I enjoyed the movie mainly because (a) I did not actually pay for the rental, and (b) I was consuming large amounts of alcohol at the time. To the film's credit, even in my drunken stupor I could tell that the scenes in which Piper pretends to sing were incredibly corny. I think I remember falling off the sofa and landing on my head from the extreme cheese-ness. You know? The kind that makes your skin crawl?In true Bruckheimer form, Leanne Rimes organizes a high-speed train robbery which results in a spectacular car wreck involving two commercial airliners and the Seattle Space Needle... but I don't want to spoil it for anybody. See it for yourself (read: do not see this for yourself). Two stars.

review/text: It's good to see Diane Lane enjoy a career renaissance after such a promising start nearly a quarter-century ago in George Roy Hill's "A Little Romance", as a prepubescent American falling in love with a Parisian boy, who whisks her away to Venice under the knowing eye of Laurence Olivier. Ironically, in this most recent movie, she plays an American woman, again in Italy, but this time escaping a broken marriage to find fulfillment in a Tuscan villa she decides to buy on the spot and renovate. Leave it to Lane to make it all look reasonable as what was precocious in the earlier movie has matured into a lovely sense of self-awareness and gravity in this film. And her beauty has become even more striking over the years. She has also become accomplished in displaying several emotions concurrently, layering her characters with a complexity of feelings so that you can never quite predict what she is thinking and what she will do next. Her post-coital train ride in Adrian Lyne's "Unfaithful" is a great example of this hard-earned skill. And Lane needs this skill in spades as she plays a fictionalized version of Frances Mayes, the author of the book upon which this greatly altered movie is based. The character seems to be longing for something she never quite figures out, and the actress convincingly portrays this sense of want. In fact, Lane almost saves this movie but not quite.At heart, this is a patronizing romantic fantasy that feels like it was produced in another era entirely, somewhere in the mid-fifties when Lane's character would be labeled a brazen, put-upon woman tainted by divorce. I kept expecting Rosanno Brazzi to come out and say something ridiculously continental to sweep her off her feet. Instead, we get Raoul Bava, who delivers the smoldering good looks but none of the irony of his rather trite Italian lover role. Lending even more color to the soap opera atmosphere is a gallery of eccentrics with an array of international accents who serve up allegorical fables and Hallmark-card advice to the heroine - an empathetic real estate agent who seems to have a crush on Frances (a flirtation I wish the director could have explored more); the young lovers who must deal predictably with the disapproval of the girl's strict parents; the rest of the inept but dedicated renovation crew; the English free-spirit who worked with Fellini and seems to have kept up her "la dolce vita" character in real life; the pregnant lesbian friend abandoned by her lover. Intentionally or not, Frances seems to help set all their lives on the right path, as the picturesquely run-down old villa gradually turns into the home of her dreams and serves as a life-affirming metaphor. So many contrivances riddle the story, especially toward the end when plot threads get tied up quickly. Frances' fate is not all that satisfying to the viewer either, and you know your plot is undercooked when a minor character is introduced in the last few minutes to provide romantic salvation. In truth, I am not sure how much better this movie could have been given the base material, as the story is nothing deeper than the Harlequin romance novels you find in the checkout line at Safeway. It just seems like there are lots of personal problems floating around the plot, but I have to give credit to Lane and director Audrey Wells who jointly make the film anything but sad. Add to that the travelogue aspect with the lovely cinematography by Geoffrey Simpson of Italy's beautiful landscapes, and you can think of worse ways to spend two hours. And watch it for the true coming-of-age of Diane Lane, radiant, gifted and far more deserving of material better than this.

review/text: This book is not a detailed lawn program for lawn care. It is more or less a collection of articles and tips on lawn care. I certainly found many useful tips and helpful advice as I read through the book. However, in reading it front to back you will find that Mr. Baker differs in some small details from one presentation to the next, but his overall conception of what goes into a good lawn remains quite consistent throughout.Mr. Baker offers several of his famous tonics that I look forward to trying. Some of the advice seems a tad dated - he talks about buying things from Brookstone that aren't offered on their website anymore and he doesn't mention his own website www.jerrybaker.com that does offer many of them and more.The book discusses different types of grass and weeds, but doesn't offer much in the way of pictures. There are books that do and I find the pictures of the weeds very helpful in identifying them. But this book does offer state-by-state help on certain things and resources you can tap to get more information - very helpful.This book is certainly worthy the price I paid for it and I like the tips I picked up. It isn't perfect, but deserves a place on your shelf.

review/text: Isaac Asimov's "Foundation" was not conceived as the beginning of series of novels. It was not conceived as a novel. It was not even conceived entirely by Isaac Asimov.Beginning in the late 1930s and for decades thereafter, the editor of the most prestigious and far more important, the best-paying monthly publication in science fiction was John W. Campbell of Astounding Science Fiction (now known as Analog.)Before taking over the editorship of the magazine, Campbell had been a popular hack writer of unabashed, wild-eyed space opera. A typical Campbell plot involved a couple of young American go-getters who whomp up a superduper space cruiser in their garage, set out on a test flight around Saturn, find themselves hurled into another dimension by a short circuit, and stumble on a planet inhabited by humans who are at war with some interplanetary Nasties who display unusually bad table manners. They forge an alliance with the good humans against the bad Nasties which, a few hundred pages later, inevitably leads to the utter annihilation of the world of the Nasties, not to mention the Nasties themselves and every vestige of their million year-old civilization and culture. By the literary standards of pulp magazine science fiction in 1936, this was pretty sophisticated stuff.When Campbell took over the reins of the magazine in 1938, he raised his sights. In short order he dumped the old stable of writers whose collective knowledge of science could have been stuffed into a peanut shell with room to spare and began cultivating new ones. A. E. van Vogt specialized in social science mumbo-jumbo that actually sounded like it meant something. L. Sprague deCamp had a sense of humor. Robert Heinlein possessed a literary spark that might be carefully fanned into a flame. And Isaac Asimov was a college kid from Brooklyn who wrote stories to stretch out the limited income generated by his father's candy store.All these and many others were overawed by the wondrous fact that the godlike JWC deigned to accept their humble stories--after he mercilessly picked apart their flaws and demanded re-writes, pronto!Those were the heroic days of magazine publishing. Editors in general and Campbell in particular did not wait for undisciplined and slothful writers to hatch ideas. No, JWC would call in his disciples and hand out plot lines and devices to be made into short stories, novelets and serialized novels. To van Vogt he tossed the idea of a totalitarian society whose tyranny was leavened by weapons shops that sold guns which could only be used in self defense. From deCamp, citing Mark Twain's "A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court," he demanded to know what would happen if a contemporary American were hurled back from Mussolini's Italy to post-imperial Rome. Of Heinlein he demanded a series of stories that would collectively outline the history of the next few hundred years. For Asimov he reserved a far larger patch of history. What, he queried, would happen when a galaxy-spanning empire finally decayed and began to fall?Asimov pondered. Then, in his own words, "With a little bit of cribbin' / From the works of Edward Gibbon / And that Greek Thucydides," Asimov took the Roman Empire of the Fifth Century and cast it into the stars as the expiring Empire of Trantor. From Eighteenth Century France he took the Encyclopedists and renamed them the Foundation. Finally he spiced up his literary gumbo with blather about "psychohistory," a mathematically-based fortune telling system which yielded valid results when the human population achieved the vast numbers only attainable in a galaxy-spanning civilization.Campbell bought the first story. The fans--at the time, a demographic aged 12-25 and virtually all-male--loved it. Campbell ordered more stories. The Trantorian Empire fell, but slowly and reluctantly. The fans loved it. The Empire blazed up under the last great imperial general, Bel Riose. (Gibbon's Belisarius, get it?) The fans loved it. A Napoleon-like conqueror appeared to muddy up the predictions of the psychohistorians. The fans loved it. Darkness and barbarism followed the collapse of civilization across the Milky Way. And the fans loved it. On and on it went, to book, to trilogy, beyond--even to new books written by other hands long after the passing of Campbell and Asimov.The fans still love it.

review/text: You can judge a film by the company it keeps, and amazon's always spot-on recommending technology tells me that fans of 'Nowhere in Africa' are also interested in the following current releases: Hotel Rwanda; A Very Long Engagement; Bad Education; and Million Dollar Baby. Since I've seen and am enthusiatic about each of those, I'd like to suggest that fans of any of those films check out 'Nowhere in Africa,' which is richly deserving of its 2002 Academy Award for best foreign language film.Pay no attention to other critiques on this page about needing to understand German, or about not being able to understand the subtleties of the dialogue because it's not in English. That's hogwash. The subtitles here are excellent, as is the acting, most notably by Juliane K&ouml;hler and Merab Ninidze as lead protagonists Jettel and Walter Redlich. These are great actors who skillfully portray every nuance of their actions and feelings in a way that transcends any language barrier.My only complaint is that director Caroline Link could have been a bit more judcious about the editing process. At 2 hours 21 minutes, the film feels about 15 minutes too long and drags at stretches. That's a small quibble in the face of the overall quality of this production.

review/text: "When do Fish Sleep" is a book of "Imponderables" (a term invented by the author meaning a question that cannot be answered by conventional means of reference books, calculations, or tangible means such as measuring). An example of an imponderable is "Why don't birds tip over when they sleep on a telephone wire?" or the like the title, "When do fish sleep?"As with any book that covers a myriad of information, there are fascinating parts and there are parts that seem to drag on. I felt some of the imponderables in the book seemed a little elementary, such as "Why is one side of a halibut dark and the other side light?" (the dark side is for camouflage and the light side is down so it does not need to be camouflaged), "What is the purpose of corn silk?" (for pollination), and "Why are bowling shoes ugly?" (so people don't steal them). Other questions were fascinating such as "Why do roaches always die on their backs?" (this is not always true, but it has a lot to do with the shape of the roach) and "Why do recipes warn us not to use fresh kiwi or pineapple in gelatin?" (the fruits contain an enzyme that break protein down). The book even has a section of "Frustables", questions where readers have mailed in theories or questions that do not yet have an answer. The author even provides a way to contact them to answer frustables or to propose new imponderables.As a geek that likes to learn, even useless information, I enjoyed the book. However, the book had no format. I felt the book could have benefited from a table of contents or have the questions divided into related sections instead of aimlessly wander from topic to topic in the book.If you have a friend who sits and reads the cards from a "Trivial Pursuit" game, this is definitely a book for them. I'd recommend the book for people whose joy in life is the pursuit of knowledge or a teenager/young adult that is curious about the world around them. The book is not really a thrilling read, so I wouldn't necessarily recommend it to a person who is looking for an interesting read.While I think the content of the book was worth a solid 4 stars, I found the lack of structure in the book distracting enough to deduct a star.

A body of work so powerful and true 2 itself that it affects your current perception on what quality music should be and sets a standard 4 artistry that just can't be duplicated. Musiq's latest effort (or should I say, "accomplishment") is a collection of 15 separate moments in soul in which he bends his tradition of soulful sounds without breaking it. "Soulstar" is what u get if u put Aijuswannseing and Juslisen in a blender with fried chicken, sweet potatoes, collard greens, biscuits, candied yams and catfish. That's just how much soul this album delivers.The 1st song that may grab your attention, if not 4 it's sheer creativity but it's captivating lyrics is "womanopoly". It's the story of a young, ambitious sista moving on up 2 Park Place while trying 2 avoid "Chance" and hold on to a share of the "Community Chest" while attempting 2 avoid all the pitfalls in this sometimes cruel game of life.On the beautiful ballad "whoknows", Musiq embraces the vulnerability and uncertainty that accompanies the start of a new relationship as well as the infinite possibilities of one."Thereason" is an introspective look back on his ongoing relationship with his first love that is music and challenges the listeners 2 see that he's actually singing 2 music...not a woman which is typically the 1st thought.On "babymother", Musiq bluntly travels down the road of unplanned and unexpected parenthood and the decisions, fear and confusion that many can relate 2 that come along 4 the ride.Soulstar is not simply just an album. It's an experience. It's a journey through soul with stops @ funk, jazz and rhythm and blues along the way.Although it was a late entry among a ton of other quality albums released in 2003, without confining it 2 any specific genre, Soulstar gets my vote 4 album of the year and I'm sure his light will continue 2 shine on the world.

review/text: This film has nothing to do with Homer's epic, save that the names of the characters are kept as well as the bare outline of the story. Book 9 (The cylcops episode) perhaps he greatest book of the poem is reduced to [junk](oh by the way Odysseus does not kill Hector- Achillles does).And Achilles would never lead his men into a cave and steal food in the first place, Anyway the poem among many other things explores the nature of KLEOS--(reknown) and Odysseus's kleos does not fit any of he conventional definitions. 1 He is a Bowman (not pictured in the film)--which means he gets to fight behind the lines of the hoplites 2 He is self-serving--almost hubristic as he himself reveals in Books 9-12 the longest sustained 1st person narration in epic (Virgil ties to copy it) 3 He constantly gets his shipmates into trouble (not a great commander). He is a liar and the opposite of the traditional Greek Hero (This is why Ajax turns his back on him in the underworld) He is however a great storyteller--and that itself is a kind of KLEOS. The language of Book 9 is so replete with puns and formulae whose natures become ironically charged coming from Odysseus mouth, that it is one of the most subtle exploations of tradition ever composed. One (and this includes Sophocles) does not know what do make of him--do we admire him or hate him? He is finally sui generis which is why he has been depicted in so many ways throuhout history. This is the CORE of the poem--a center which the film ignores. For a good rendition of the Odyssey watch O Brother Where art Thou? Or read Joyce's ULYSSES.

review/text: I love it!!! It's made of sturdy rubber on the outside, and soft cotton on the inside. It really makes you sit straight and pushes your breasts upwards!!! I've only been wearing it for a few hours. And unlike the other customers, it was easy to put on at first, then after two hours, i went to the second hook. It's comfortable and really gives me the hourglass figure i wanted!!!I think this will give me the shape i want after a few months of use, so I'll update later!! :)--Update--I really had a hard time with this the first day. It rolls all around my waist and i feel so hot in it! and when i took it off, it itched like hell!!! i had to put ointment all over my tummy! But you get used to it eventually, i almost never take it off, i even wear it to bed!! My body does keep the shape afterwards. It held it for five minutes after the first time, ten minutes after the second and so on. It doesn't really reduce my appetite, i just feel really uncomfortable in it if i eat a lot. But it's really worth the price!! I'll update again a while later! :)--Update--Okay i had to take out one star. Yeah it does work and everything but it itches so bad!!! i put a light camisole shirt underneath, but it still itches! my skin burns for hours after i take it off!!! On the plus side, it's only been 2 weeks and i already lost 2 inches off my waist! but i have to do something about that itching! and i wash it every three to four day... maybe i should wash it every day? Or maybe I'm allergic to something in it! i really don't know, but it's very annoying

I did check reviews on Amazon before I used it and after reading mostly positive I decided to go for it. I was pleasantly surprised how well it worked. I made sure my face was clean of all lotions, etc and was conservative w/ the placement for the first try - and wow - it worked nicely. Just follow the directions and it should work for you. Needless to say the shapers they have may not match your eyebrow shape exactly so you might have to shape the strips yourself a bit w/ scissors or just be careful in your placement on the brow.

review/text: There is much to be admired in Anne Sofie Von Otter's interpretation : she makes of Alceste a truly moving character, and really charges each word with meaning and expression. Compare this and her interpretation of Clytemnestre in "Iphig&eacute;nie en Aulide" (Gardiner - Erato) recorded 10 or fifteen years ago and you will hear how her knowledge and diction of the French language have improved to reach perfection. However her voice sounds too stretched by the tessitura of the role and, if still powerful, discolours at the bottom of the range especially. Because of that, I'm afraid the Alceste of Jessye Norman for Baudo is still too strong of a contestant : she might be a bit too diva-esque to make you believe that she is a real character, but the voice is just too beautiful for words. Baudo's set also has Nicolai Gedda's Adm&egrave;te.Then there is Gardiner's conducting. I really do not think that he brings life to the piece : on the contrary, I find his conducting rather cold, as often, more an intellectual approach than something coming from the heart.What I found really irritating, is that he allowed himself to change the lyrics of the only well-known aria of the whole work : under Gardiner the aria "Divinit&eacute;s du Styx,..." becomes "Ombres, larves..." (a literal translation of the Italian version's libretto). How presomptious is this ! Gardiner justifies this in the booklet by saying that Berlioz had himself recommended this alternative verse when he adapted the work for his prima donna. However she refused to change the text and still sang the aria starting with "Divinit&eacute;s du Styx"... I guess she also found the "new" lyrics sounded too ridiculous in French ("What larvae ?").Not the ideal set then... When will we get a version conducted by Minkowski ?

review/text: I just finished reading Dean Koontz's Frankenstein, an imaginative expansion of Mary Shelly's classic. Two hundred years later, Victor Frankenstein's original creation, now known as Deucalion, is a mysterious facially-tatooed Tibetan recluse who returns home once he learns that Victor is still alive, well & creating.In the intervening years Victor has managed to create a number of creatures to inhabit his new world order. Among them include:+ A godless, Igor-like priest (without the deformity)+ An autistic soul looking for happiness; called Randal Six+ A severed head (named Karloff) and an Adams Family-like disembodied hand+ A homicidal police detective, how ironic+ Several Stepford Wife-like brides called Erika who are numbered like movie sequels+ And a monstrous, troll-like creature who emerges from Jonathan Harker's torso in a manner reminiscent of the movie Alien. Ummm, wasn't there a Jonathan Harker in Bram Stoker's Dracula?Other monsters included:+ The horror of abuse & neglect+ The hollowness & anxiety of autism+ The despair of soul-less existence+ The terror of being violently used, stalked, maimed & killed+ The madness of unbridled ego & self-gratification+ The futile quests for soul-less faith, hope & happiness+ The guilt of righting wrongs, erasing the past & erasing the present+ The desire to create a Hitler-like world ruled/inhabited by superior beingsStill reflecting, I'm wondering whether this was intended as a tribute to the horror greats & cult movie/TV favorites or an ernest attempt to stand on Mary Shelly's shoulders to create something entirely new, yet entirely old.By the way, nice homage to Boris Karloff & The Brain that Wouldn't Die.[...]

review/text: I think it would be fair to say that this book is an important work in the world of letters that emerged after World War I. The "Great War to End All Wars" was a watershed in history because as "total war" it involved the civilian population as no previous war had. And because of the many new weapons of mass destruction that were used for the first time, ten million persons died and millions of others were wounded and mutilated.Albert Camus' father, Lucien, was killed in WWI, and I think it would intuitively be realistic to think that this had a profound effect on the thoughtful youth living in straitened circumstances in Algeria. In most cases, the death of a parent will take some of the glow out of childhood. Thus, we see a man who was personally affected and wounded by WWI and a Europe in the throes of disillusionment and recovery after 1918.To many, WWI was the straw that broke the camel's back. Why didn't God prevent the war with its enormous suffering? How could a just and good God allow man to be ruined not only by poverty but also by the havoc of the war machine? Why would a civilization governed by the rational ideals that reason and goodwill could work things out fail so miserably? Was the world, and the West in particular, not shaped by the idea that responsible action governed by the moral sense would create and ever-evolving, more perfect world? And was this not all a wretched lie?Surely then, we can begin to understand how Camus and others began to believe that they were living in an absurd world, a meaningless place, where, nonetheless, one had to go on living, and by one's choices create one's life and, in concert with others, the life of social man.Thus, out of the existential crisis of the moral and economic collapse of WWI, mankind, and European-kind, would rebuild its future out of the welter of lived experience, not on preconceived principles or models provided by religion or "bourgeois morality."Thus, we see Camus' development of the absurd. In The Stranger, Camus uses the term only one time and seems to pass over it lightly giving it relatively little significance. He says, "What few people were about seemed in an absurd hurry." However, his biographer points out that the entire feeling and mood of the novel really gives us the feeling of the absurd."There is an irreducible difference between the notion and the experience of the absurd; indeed, `The Myth ofSysiphus might be said to aim at giving us this idea, and The Stranger at giving us the feeling'."How does the absurd arise? We have already suggested that WWI was the defining event for Camus and many others in bringing meaninglessness to the forefront of consciousness, but this is not to exclude many other elements."The feeling of the absurd can arise in a variety of ways, through, for example, the perception of Nature's indifference to man's values and ideals, through recognition of the finality of death, or through the shock caused by the sudden perception of the pointlessness of life's routine."Because life has become absurd, and because no eternal principles apply to direct this society, then the ultimate question becomes, "Why live?" And, if we choose to live, then we must reach some conclusion about how to live, how to move forward day-to-day."Camus is well-known for his statement that `there is only one really serious philosophical problem, that of suicide. To judge that life is or is not worth the trouble of being lived, this is to reply to the fundamental question of philosophy.'"However, Camus does not believe that suicide is the answer. He believes that man can devote himself "in a self-sacrificing manner to the welfare of his fellow man....if he does so without hope of reward and conscious that in the long run it makes no difference how he acts....it is possible to be a saint without illusion."The idea of man in the absurd is only partially revealed in The Stranger, but becomes clearer if one reads, The Myth of Sisyphus, The Rebel, and The Plague. In these works, and others,"Human pride and greatness are shown [not] in surrender...but in living in the consciousness of the absurd and yet revolting against it by man's committing himself and living in the fullest manner possible."Now, returning to the work The Stranger, we are in a position to answer a number of questions: Has Camus depicted an absurd world? Is the absurd a satisfactory alternative to the world of reason and morals that the absurd seeks to replace? Are any of the characters "living in the fullest manner possible" or on the road to becoming "saint[s] without illusion?"It is apparent that The Stranger does indeed express the feeling or mood of the absurd. The sense of meaninglessness is palpable, and the pathologies and criminal tendencies expressed in the various characters and relations among the characters are presented without any sense of judgment of their behavior. They are portrayed as though they are "just folks." Indeed, that is the height of the absurd. On the other hand, the justice system with all its preconceived judgments about Meursault, about personality, and about sin or right and wrong is portrayed as expressing just so much hot air. The absurd life for Camus is simply accepting life as it is lived whether or not those lives are or are not being lived according to our preconceived judgments about how life should be lived. Life cannot be judged. It cannot be under-stood "from the outside." Indeed, it remains obscure to those living it, but live it they must!Thus Camus draws a line in the sand. Which is real life - the lives depicted throughout the book or life seen through the prism of the moralistic magistrate, prosecutor, defense attorney, and prison chaplain? For this writer, although Camus might wish otherwise, Camus has depicted the problem, but not the solution. There is clearly a crisis of meaning in the modern world, and I would even state that I think it has reached to a deeper and more critical mass, so to speak, than when Camus was writing. We have lived through even more horrors than he, and the sense of meaninglessness, even nihilism, is more pervasive than ever. I even saw a young person with a T-shirt that read, "Whoever has the most things when he dies wins." It would be fair to say that he was proclaiming an absurd view of life.I do not see any affirmation of "saints without illusions" in this particular work, and since Camus drew a line in the sand, it is my considered view that the Algerian court system with its perceived anachronistic morals and values is actually closer to truth and "reality" than Meursault or any of his cohorts.Camus has not confounded religion with his feeble and spurious unwillingness to repent or believe. In fact, insofar as we have been given the opportunity to get to know Meursault better than the prison chaplain, we can see that Meursault is far more darkened and hardened that the chaplain might have imagined.Nor has the novel revealed that middle-class values are empty. Indeed, the bourgeois goals of the American and French revolutions to provide every citizen with a fair trial exemplifies the inherent kindness and striving for justice that marks the post-Enlightenment, democratic civilization of Western Europe, and, in a different way, the United States of America.Yes, the crisis of values truly exists. It existed in 1940, and it exists today. Far too many have rejected the middle way of Aristotle's virtuous man, the "golden mean." Far too many have rejected our institutions as based on lies, and unreal assumptions. Far too many have rejected faith in the true and living God, the redemptive power of the Cross of Christ. Yet, giving in to a tidal wave of meaninglessness is not nor ever can be the answer. The Stranger accurately suggests the parameters for understanding the absurdity of our times, but it does not even begin to suggest an answer that will transform a negative consciousness into a hopeful and happy one.

Govt' guaranteed loans(fanny & Freddy), Farm subsidies, automation, out sourcing, to big to fail, etc. etc. "Government-guaranteed home mortgages, especially when a negligible down payment or no down payment whatever is required, inevitably mean more bad loans than otherwise."

review/text: I am not a Catholic but enjoyed this book very much when I first read it sometime ago. Dr. Schreck has written a book that goes beyond the usual Catholic apologist rhetoric and simply explains his position without resulting to silly arguments and questenable tactics.His writing style is easy and likeable. He is not so bent on trying to prove, in my opinion, as much as he is trying to share the essence of Catholic beliefs to outsiders. The book is probably, though not necessarily, directed to protestants. I say this because he addresses many protetsant objections to Catholism, without seeking to enrage those on the other side. It is a sharpe way of presenting one's faith, without causing more flame to the fire.The book is not the most detialed or academic of its kind, but this again is a strength. The layperson, who most needs to read and better understand the Catholic faith and practice, will find this book most appealling (at least I hope so). I think this was the author's intent. A great little book.

I always complained about the time it takes to find the satellites, but this HP device takes a lot longer!Even in open areas under blue sky, it takes several minutes to operate properly. I tried it in San Francisco, Chicago, Miami, and also in Brazil, where I live. The result is always the same: you walk or ride for a long time before it finds your position. Quite disappointing.Buildings and eletric cables interfere a lot with the reception, and very often you will lose signal. Bluetooth connectivity, though, works fine.Having a GPS associated with a PDA (I have an iPaq 4150) is great: there are great softwares available.

review/text: I partially owe my love of hockey to NHL '93 on Sega Genesis, and I have played most hockey games since then. I find this one to deliver the least amount of fun and highest amount of frustration of any that I have played.Here is my laundry list of problems with this game, some that I would consider major and some that I would consider peeves:1. GraphicsThis game looks like N64/PS1 graphics. Games wind up being the dark blobs vs. the light blobs, as far as I can tell.2. AIPlayers skate right past the puck when they're under computer control. The only thing the AI does on defense is collapse everyone in front of the net.3. Player DifferentiationEvery player plays just like every other player. Paul Kariya can hit as hard as Chris Chelios. Adam Foote is as fast as Mike Modano, with turbo, on the breakaway. They all look the same. They all play the same. EA Sports' system of Heroes and Big Hitters sure looks brilliant in comparison.4. CommentatorsThis game licenses elements from ESPN--why do we get Mono and Tone for commentators? They're boring and repetitive. How about Gary Thorne and Clement, Clement, hands of cement? Or Dave Strader and Darren Pang? Barry Melrose's machine-gun laugh before a game? John Buccigross saying "He is clutch, and clutch is everything in life?"Commentary typically sounds like this: "He's going to have to continue to make saves like that if the" (pause) (insert team name here) (pause) "are going to have any chance!"(The worst error: when I won the Stanley Cup, the commentators said, and I quote, "The Stars are one step closer to the Stanley Cup!")5. SoundtrackIf you like the same cheesy organ riffs over and over, this soundtrack is for you!6. OfficiatingThe puck-carrier can get a penalty for hooking. Yeah, right, Sega! And the goalie can sit on an unplayable puck while 20 seconds run off the game clock before it's called "Puck Frozen." Oh, and then there are the random times that the puck is frozen for no reason...7. Shooting/ScoringThis is the real killjoy of the game. It's very easy in NHL 2K3 to have 50 or 60 shots and not score a goal. There are only two shots that can score: skate in on the off-wing and deke the goalie to the inside, and take a slapshot from the faceoff circle. One-timers (the staple of EA Sports) rarely score. Redirections don't score. You can't cherry-pick just outside the crease. If a defenseman takes a slapshot from the point, it's almost always blocked, and never beats the goalie.8. Default SettingsTeam strategy settings default to manual for both player and AI teams. That's right, unless you choose to set the computer team to Automatic strategy changes, it uses the same strategy for the ENTIRE game, regardless of score. Also, the default voice mask for online play is Anonymous, which ranks somewhere between "nails on the chalkboard" and "Gilbert Gottfried" on the annoyance scale.The only advantages that this game has over NHL 2003 is that it is XBox Live enabled, has the concept of a minor-league system, and has some nice along-the-boards gameplay.It's a real shame that this game is as poor as it is. NHL 2K3's "controllability" of what you can do during the game is top-notch. It smartly uses the triggers as modifiers for other buttons to let you have real control over what the players do. The gameplay options are extremely customizable (but they left out the setting for "Fun").All in all, rarely have I played a game that delivers less fun than NHL 2K3.

Gone from the 2008 issue, however, are the hidden easter-egg cleverly humorous player commentaries, which, though entertaining, were often insulting. This year's write-ups were pure vanilla, politically correct and seemly cut-and-pasted from player to player.I miss the occasional humorous commentary, like from the 2007 edition on Tony Clark: "His 2005 was regal, impressive, and mighty, like the elegance of a trumpet voluntary. His 2006 season was more like a pack of fourth graders playing trombone for the very first time with no instruction during a locust infestation."Granted, too much humor distracts from the purpose of the book, but being absolutely devoid of humor makes it a boring numbers read.

There are already major differences in punctuation, word choices, and scene breaks between the original Collins (TAKEN AT THE FLOOD) and Dodd Mead (THERE IS A TIDE) editions of this novel. There are further differences between the Dodd Mead editions republished by Random House/Avenel and the Dodd Mead editions republished by Simon & Shuster/Pocket. There are further additions still in the Signet, Berkley, and Black Dog & Leventhal editions. For every publishing house putting out her works, there seem to be a new batch of editors altering Agatha Christie's words and the sound of her voice. What's the matter with these publishers? Whose voice do they think we want to hear when we sit down to a novel by Agatha Christie? And what will she sound like twenty years from now? It's frightening that her estate has failed to see the importance of guarding her words as she wrote them. Please tell me I'm not the only one here who senses that a crime has been committed.

review/text: I happened upon this album because I heard "Sugar" (or whatever that song is called) played on KROQ and my musical tastes changed forever. The album is a revolutionary breakthrough in musical expression, combining the experimentation of greats like Frank Zappa with the melodic ability of Nat King Cole. The mind-force that created this music (the collective apparatus that is the intellectual force behind System) is absolute genius. Every grunt, note, sound effect and scream is perfectly woven into the fabric that assaults the ears.I have friends who hate this album as they cannot get past the staccato resonance of some of the more popular songs, but in my humble opinion, these only add to the total experience that is Toxicity. This may well be System's masterpiece - although we can hope they find ways to outdo themselves in the future. The Bonus DVD was a nice surprise and at the time of my purchase it was available at the same price.

review/text: The Rabbi's Cat is a wonderful book. I heard the author speak on NPR and got the book. The book is in the form of a comic strip, each box lovingly illustrated by the author. The pictures are wonderful, particularly of the cat. They are a joy to behold.Even better are the stories, anecdotes taken from the lives of the Jews in North Africa in the thirties. The stories are both very sad and hysterically funny. The cat has a sardonic turn of phrase that had me in stitches. Through the difficult medium of comics, the author has managed to capture the atmosphere of the time and place. Much of the book is given to musings about life, philosophy, love, God and so on. If you like a good discussion, you'll enjoy this book.Although the books can be enjoyed by non-Jews, I think if you don't know the basics of Judaism, you'll be missing the most vital part of the book. Of course, the book is so appropriate for the cat lover. The author clearly understands cats perfectly.

review/text: First of all, I'm not a typical Clay Aiken fan. I'm not a teenage girl, or a drooling middle-age woman who thinks Clay's the greatest thing since Bobby Darin. I'm a fortysomething male (and no, I'm not gay) who saw Clay on "American Idol," felt there was something "magical" (in the words of Gladys Knight) about him and became an instant fan. And while "Measure of a Man" may not be a classic CD, or even one for the ages, so to speak, I find it to be one of the most satisfying, and refreshingly honest pieces of music of the year. Twelve songs and not a clinker in the bunch, all exceedingly listenable and unpretentious and and beautifully sung by a young man with incredible vocal pipes and an uncanny sense of what works for himself and his audience.The highlights: First single "Invisible," the title tune, "Touch," and the incredible power ballad "I Survived You," which Clay should have dedicated to the lunk-headed judges who clearly favored last year's head-scratcher-of-a-winner Ruben Studdard, whose entire act consisted of bad Luther Vandross imitations.Lowlights: None, although if I have any complaints with "MOAM" it's that there are one-or-two-too-many sound-alike ballads in the middle of the album and not enough acoustic, quiet moments that truly showcase Clay's vocal mastery. Also, there are too many producers working independently on each song, so the album does come across as overproduced, which is one of the few legitimate critical complaints against this album.Regardless, this is a fine debut project from a young man who is going to be around a lot longer than his air-brained critics like to think. Yes, it would be nice if Clay displayed more "edge" in future projects, but there's something to be said about an artist who isn't afraid to present a product that appeals to those of us who would rather listen to anything other than critical darlings like Outkast and gutter rappers like 50 Cent.Sorry, critics. Clay Aiken's the real deal. Now deal with it.

review/text: Welcome to Hammer's outstanding &quot;Hands of the Ripper&quot;, one of the studio's last movies and one of their best. The story tells of Anna, a young girl who is actually Jack the Ripper's daughter, and who was traumatised as a toddler by witnessing a vicious killing (seen in the prologue). Now an adult, she is prone to murderous seizures which provide the many grisly highlights of the film. It sounds rather lurid, but the film takes the subject seriously, and as a whole, the plot is tremendously engaging. Anna's rages are only triggered by a specific set of circumstances, and the script creates a surprising and clever staging for each one, following on every time with a suitably gory slaughter. The film features great performances from its prestigious cast, particularly Angharad Rees who is luminously beautiful as Anna, and Eric Porter as the doctor who realises her identity but is compelled to try and cure her rather than turn her in (as well as falling for her charms, as she has no recollection of what she does when she goes into a trance). Of course, in the movies such a situation can only end in tragedy, and the climax of the story is elegantly downbeat and very effective. The period London setting, the photography and the directing all fall perfectly into place, and &quot;Hands of the Ripper&quot; can be judged as one of Hammer's greatest acheivements. It's crying out for a DVD release, so hopefully someone will take the initiative very soon. There is a UK region 2 release, but it's only available as a box set with two far inferior British 70's horror movies &quot;The Monster&quot; and &quot;The Uncanny&quot;. I was lucky and got one from a split set, but it's a real shame that most people will miss out on enjoying this movie by it not getting the circulation it deserves.

review/text: While author James Tully presents a rational and logical argument for James Kelly as Jack the Ripper, most of Tully's arguments are based on circumstancial evidence, inductive reasoning, and details which easily could be merely coincidental. That's not to say the arguments fail to persuade -- in fact, Tully presents a great deal to consider. However, for this story to gain acceptance as the definitive solution, a great many more unanswered questions and possible alternative explanations would need resolved. It's food for thought he's trying to construct as a full explanatory meal. I'd recommend borrowing it from the library before buying it, if you are considering adding it to your collection.

review/text: I was hooked into this game for about a week and then beat it. It has a career mode where you start out with a few players and try to beat top teams in various cities, adding their best player when you do beat them. If you have played an NBA Street game before, you probably know the style of the game. For those who haven't played NBA Street, the game is played by ones to 21. There are also trick points where if you get a certain amout you get a gamebreaker. If you score a basket during a gamebreaker, it gives you points but also subtracts points from the opponent. This game has no online, poor graphics and limited minigames, three very big cons for me. I would recommend buying NBA Live 2006, which has online and franchise, but I don't own it yet.

review/text: Spellman, a lucid analyst of the avant garde jazz movement in the '60s (see his liner notes, for example, on the original release of Coltrane's &quot;Ascension&quot;), has contributed with this book four compelling portraits of musicians who gave and have given their lives to jazz.&quot;Four Lives in the Bebop Business&quot; profiles two altoists, Jackie McLean and Ornette Coleman; and two pianists, Cecil Taylor and Herbie Nichols. Spellman skillfully crafts the narratives, while wisely allowing his subjects to tell large chunks of their stories in their own words.It becomes clear as one reads the book that it took a lot of guts to be a jazz musician during the '50s and '60s (and still does). All four of the musicians faced major obstacles in pursuing their art.McLean, who enjoyed the greatest amount of commercial success of the four, especially early on, battled drug addiction. Taylor and Coleman faced open hostility because of their challenging, groundbreaking approaches to playing their instruments. Nichols (the only one of the four who is not still alive) was just plain ignored, despite his brilliantly original playing (check out the two-disk Blue Note compilation of his music), and spent much of his all-too-brief career playing in Greenwich Village dives.In spite of bad accommodations, poor pay, public indifference, critical hostility and difficulty finding gigs, these artists, the book makes clear, would never play anything other than jazz. In this sense, the book has an underlying inspirational message. Still, it remains for America to fully embrace its only true indigenous art form, something which to this day has not occurred.The book also offers insights from the musicians on the creative process and about the historic changes in jazz that occurred during the '60s, from the perspective of men who were on the front lines of the battles between critics, musicians, and the listening public.Required reading for the serious jazz listener.

review/text: I noticed right off the bat that only 7 people reviewed this movie one Amazon. Wow. While this movie has its share of flaws and the ending is a little weak, it still was a fun ride for me. Out of the many thrillers out there, this isn't in the top bunch to see at all but it definitely is up there for originality. Now, I'm not going to get into if it was realistic or not because I don't even know but as for the movie, it's a good thriller worth a rent.The movie's about a doctor whose wife is murdered. Following this event, he is suspected of murder, relieved of his charges, loses his children to his step sister but that's not even the worst...the killer isn't found. This doctor is very troubled by this until he meets a promissing doctor working on a drug that could allow one to use the blood of a dead individual to see what they saw. Guess what. He uses it to see what his wife saw and figure out who killed his wife.The movie does has some problems but is a good rental and the flashback scenes are well made. Ray Liotta does a nice job in leading a weak cast somehow to success.

If you are a fan of heavy, rock, music this cd is for you. Not as vulgar as the first. This cd really made out well in 2001 and 2002. They got there songs Science and Shimmy on two video games. The best music video in the world is Aerials and that song is featured on this cd. The songs Toxicity and Chop Suey also had great videos made for them. Some people say Serj's vocals are bad but I think there awesome. The drummer and guitarist are also great. I like how they start off there songs. It kind of starts off soft then gets really heavy.If you can find the limited edition version of this cd with a dvd featuring 3 live tracks and a toxicity video, get it.RATINGS:1.Prison Song-(3:21)-10/102.Needles-(2:13)-10/103.Deer Dance-(2:54)-9/104.Jet Pilot-(2:06)-9/105.X-(1:58)-10/106.Chop Suey-(3:30)-10/107.Bounce-(1:54)-10/108.Forest-(4:00)-9/109.ATWA-(2:56)-10/1010.Science-(2:42)-10/1011.Shimmy-(1:50)-10/1012.Toxicity-(3:38)-10/1013.Psycho-(3:45)-9/1014.Aerials-(6:11)-10/10Rumours of a new System of a Down cd coming out in November of 2004.

And at two separate points in the film (I forget what points, in fact I seemed to lose all perspective on time) I literally went cross eyed. My right eye is still lingering in a lazy wobble at the moment. All I really do remember was rooting for Leonard Nimoy to destroy the planet and all the retarded humans that inhabit it.Things I learned from T3 - Michael Bay's film making talents could effectively be adapted into a new kind of non-surgical lobotomy procedure for mental patients. I think I dodged the bullet on permanent catatonia due to the fact that I spent half of the movie day dreaming about more exciting things in my life...like porn, and rearranging my sock drawer.

review/text: The first time I read this book, as a high school sophomore, I detested it. Now, two years later, being forced to read it over for an English class, I still cannot write that I enjoyed it or found it profound in any way. All I do know is that this time around, though not having taken a liking to the work, I do RESPECT it. I do not see Meursault as any sort of hero. Nor do I completely understand the concept of existentialism. I read many of the online reviews and noticed that many others did not seem to really grasp the concept of existentialism either. The first reviewer asks &quot;Is the protagonist a sociopath..?&quot; That is something I had considered while reading the book. In the Ward translation, page 100, Meursault admits &quot;I had never been able to truly feel remorse for anything.&quot; A sociopath (pyschopath) is one who feels no guilt, one with an underdeveloped super ego. If so, and Meursault is a sociopath, how can he be regarded as a hero, or as &quot;at the mercy of society.&quot; He is responsible for his own actions. People tend to forget that he killed a man and deserved, if not a death sentence, one of life imprisonment. Such a man as he would be a constant threat to society. One reviewer points out that the root of Meursaults name means death. I saw the symbolism, but it annoys me when my friends tell me how much they enjoy the book, yet they have missed such details. I do not see how they can appreciate the book except for on a superficial level. All things considered, I found the book dry and overrated, but am left with a new sense of understanding. Who knows, maybe the third time around I'll give it another star. That is, if I am ever forced to pick it up again.

Yet, he is the one author I know of who actually tries to seek out the origins of religion using modern research into chimpanzee behavior. I wonder what Jane Goodall thinks of it? First there was Freud's Totem and Taboo, a mere root to Young's amazing tree. As he writes, " . . . the Darwinian-Freudian-Foxian root-stock on to which I would graft the story of alpha-shaman." I'm not sure exactly how to take him, but it is dazzling stuff. Since there was no impartial observer in the Garden of Eden, perhaps he is correct.

My questions are: What time periods does the story take place? Is this left unanswered so readres from any century can relate to it, since it is a story of humanity in every century? Does GGM really believe our lives are written in stone and untangible? This book makes you thgink about life and everything youve ever done in your life. It makes you think of your family and their similarities to characters in GGM book. I recommend it tro anyone who thinks they can handle sex, war, trauma, death, human decay, and every single human feeling.

It's a bit poppy, sort of indie rock, and still a throwback to the spaced out technical metal that made &quot;Dimension Hatross&quot; a transcendently unreal album. They incorporate more muffled strumming bass/guitar impacts in the style of mainstream bands like Pantera, but these musicians are serious about reforming after loss of a member and making competitive, current music. Still listenable to this day, &quot;Negatron&quot; is both emotional and coldly logical, violently lowbrow and mentally mutilatingly highbrow. Enjoy it if you have the headspace.

review/text: Francie begins this story as an eleven-year-old, living in poverty in Brooklyn. Her father is an alcoholic who takes part-time work as a singing waiter. Her mother cleans houses to bring in most of their money. Francie and her ten-year-old brother, Neely, help out by collecting bits of scrap metal and other valuables to sell to the junk man for recycling. The family lives in a tiny apartment, is looked down on by many others and often they go hungry when money doesn't stretch far enough to buy food.Despite all of the hardships in her life, though, Francie is nearly overwhelmed by the beauty of the life she is living. She loves her father's singing voice, and she loves the things her mother is able to cook with their meager supply of food. She finds peace in listening to her parents talk late at night, and joy in reading every book she can get her hands on. She is happy in the way only a child can be.As Francie grows up, she comes to find that life is often hard, and her family is less fortunate than many. She observes the sacrifices her family members make, and is called upon to make sacrifices of her own. Throughout it all, though, she never loses her determination or her love for her family and for Brooklyn.The way Francie thinks and writes is absolutely beautiful. I like how Smith captured that peculiar habit of children to see the beauty in even the worst of circumstances. I liked the beginning of this book much better than the end, though. I was eager to see Francie and her family come into some money and have an easier life, but I felt the end of the book to be a bit too happy to fit with the rest. When an entire book is about struggling and fending for yourself, it doesn't seem right when something good happens, as it did to Francie's mother, out of the blue.

review/text: The three previous reviews are right on: to my mind (and I confess that I am not unique in this) Ulysses is the greatest novel in world literature. It is unrivalled in style (who could rival it?) or in character. And who is not moved by the pathos and humor of the book, the sorrows and triumphs of L Boom? This lovely edition befits the novel itself. You may want to read and re-read and take notes in "corrected" editions. This is the one to stare at lovingly, longingly.

review/text: Dickens has an incredible energy that, after putting away a few dull contemporary novels, should be immeadiately striking to anyone. And with the wonderfully satirical opening of Hard Times, "Now, what I want is, Facts...." he continues to begin a book better than anyone. That energy does not dissapate as the novel progresses.Hard Times is set in the industrial but fictional Coketown. Its central point of concern is a certain ultilitarian/Victorian sensibility, a point of view that reduces everthing to rationality. This reaches is most tragic moment when a father must watch her daughter literally crushed by a "economical" marriage that he encouraged. Rationality also dictates the divisions of labor and class, that become dehumanizing.But while this book is satirical, and does have a social agenda, Hard Times can't be reduced to that agenda. It isn't merely a collection of opinions. There is too much here for that. Characters are shamed, outcast, forced into "sensible" but unfulfilling lives, and commit crimes while letting others take the fall. Unlike some of our contemporary satires, Hard Times doesn't just mock. There is heart and tragedy too. Further, no one, rich or poor, gets off the hook. Whether its Slackbridge the union leader and a group factory workers, or a wealthy banker, anyone who lacks humanity is shamed. Probably the richest and most aristoratic character, James Harthouse, is judged indifferently. Dickens isn't a partisan.Hard Times is the shortest Dickens novel and its brevity is a double edged sword. While one is not exhausted at its conclusion (As I was with David Copperfield), and there are less story lines to confuse, you a don't know the characters as well as you do with the longer novels, and the cast of characters isn't as wide. Also absent is some of the jolly or quirky characters that are Dickens staples. This accounts for why some call it a dreary novel, though I disagree.This isn't his best, and there will be some moments when you shake your head (why does everyone seem to die with perfect timing?) but Hard Times is still great. When I criticize one of Dickens' novels, I compare his low moments with his high ones, not to other writers. I will continue to read his novels and love their energy and wit.

review/text: I bought this book because I have always suspected there was more to presocratic philosophy than the classic textbook approach. For example, in Diogenes Laertius several of these philosophers are described as weird mystical figures or even having supernatural powers. Also I read somewhere that the greek word for "thinking deeply" means literally "keeping your diafragm stretched" (or something like that), like in some yogic meditation exercise. So Dr. Kingsley's book seemed interesting enough to me.And it is an interesting book, I don't dispute this. The problems are 1) that the author tries too hard to reach an unrealistically wide audience and 2) that his ego is way too big.The first problem shows first in the big font used for the text and the about 50 blank or near-blank pages used to separate chapters, sections, etc. If the book had been designed in the usual way it would take about 300 pages only. But, more importantly, the text itself is handicapped by the removal of serious explanations or even footnotes (they are all lumped together at the end of the book, but there are no references to them in the text itself) that could make a casual reader uneasy, but that are fundamental for judging the validity of its contents.The second problem is manifest in the structure of the book and in the language used throughout. Why does Dr. Kingsley think his reconstruction of Parmenides philosophy/teaching has any practical relevance for anyone? If you had any spiritual/mystical leaning, you have many options nowadays, some of them representing long traditions, with precisely established teaching methods and vast selections of literature. Why would anyone take what amounts to a mere conjecture and build a mystical system out of it? Ultimately, what we are presented with is Dr. Kingsley's point of view, not Parmenides, not Empedocles, and, no matter how much I want to agree with him, I would not take it as the basis of my personal philosophy. I think Dr. Kingsley should have tried a more verbose exposition of his hypothesis, and dropped the "self-help" angle.Besides, there are some affirmations that look quite doubtful to me, like the continuous link he tries to establish between Parmenides/Empedocles and the Gnostic and Hermetic movements. How, When, Who? I thought it was pretty well understood that those had more in common with neoplatonism and, later, with kabbalah. There may be some Parmenidian influence, who knows, but I would expect it to be indirect and generic. I would consider the Western/Eastern thought mutual influence a much more fruitful line of research. In any case, more substantiation is needed.On the positive side I could say many things (after all I have rated it with 3 stars) but I will mention only two: that the book gave me many ideas to ponder about, even some inspiration, and that it is the best book I have found so far on the topic of presocratic philosophy reinterpretation (but I really hope this is more my fault than its merit).

It's nothing personal, but there are just some people who you will meet in life that are just full of it and have no aspirations, goals and/or plans in life. Sista Souljah does speak the truth on many issues such as racism, sexism, being intelligent and at the same time being overlooked in the black community, poverty and education.I would recommend this book to anyone who is willing to question our status as Africans living in America.

review/text: Although highly regarded in its day, &quot;Lilies of the Field&quot; is now considered a relic of the civil rights era or Hollywood's token Oscar &quot;gesture&quot; to a Black performer. This is unfortunate, since it underrates both the film and Poitier's textured performance. &quot;Lilies...&quot; is a simple, funny and touching story that emphasizes respect for the differences in people. Lilia Skala gives a powerhouse performance as the Mother Superior, almost stealing the film from Poitier. She gives just the right measures of rage and prideful determination to make her character sadly noble. Hers is one of the most memorable supporting performances on film, and she deserved an Oscar as well. But this is Poitier's show, and he gives the character of Homer humor, rebeliousness and magnanimity that make him unique in films. Rather than the usual angry political stance Hollywood takes with anything involving race, this character is presented as simple, decent, a little lost, but just an average man doing the best he can. There's nothing &quot;special&quot; about him, which makes the character (and Poitier's performance) special and memorable. Of note in this edition, the digital transfer of the film is especially crisp and vivid, not the usual slack job MGM does with these older films. Unfortunately, there are almost no extras, and it would have been great to have a commentary by Poitier to listen to. Still, this is a memorable film for the whole family. Makes me wanna holler.

review/text: I've look at a half dozen other knot books over the years, and this is the best one I've seen. Very clear photos of the tying procedures, along with the use of differently colored ropes when more than two ropes are being used, and nice, glossy paper so the photos look great, make this a very visually appealing knot book to just browse, or to seriously learn from. Also the author includes some interesting history when that is known. For example, the prusik knot, now used in mountain climbing, was originally invented by a Dr. Prusik, an Austrian music professor, before World War I for tying broken musical strings together.The book covers 200 different knots. There are knots for every practical need, as well as mainly aesthetic ones such as the "lucky knot" or four-leaf clover knot, which could be used for a keychain bob.For a knot enthusiast, Budworth has an interesting bio. He's appeared on TV and radio, was president of the International Knot Guild, which he founded, and is a consultant on forensic matters relating to knots in Great Britain. Overall, an attractive and well done book on an obscure but interesting craft and specialty.
